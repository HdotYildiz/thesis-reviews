"I have had other Grand Theft Auto games though the years but this one is just as much fun as the other ones. I am 63 years old and some of the quest are a little hard for me but give it time and I can figure it out. Fun game but I think it is for older kids or adults.",5,7,1,61,205,0,68,3,5,91.89,5.49,2.5,8.13
"GTA5 is definitely not for kids -- lots of language, violence, drugs, alcohol, etc. If you are OK with that, you will experience a whole new world as your customized character and encounter endless scenarios that are rather realistic. Even more fun is online gaming mode, where you can hang out with your buddies while enjoying some quality gaming. We first purchased this game on PC, but the PS4 version really takes the cake.",5,3,0,73,341,12,113,4,10,57.36,9.79,10.04,13.88

"Good deal for the full game and money to start in the GTA online world but what stopped me from giving this 5 stars was the fact that you still have to buy an online membership to play online.

"my 22 year old son asked for this for Christmas. he has played it a few times and says that he likes it. He has all of them. Of course it rated M for Mature and I understand why - but age considered and maturity level, combined with an understanding that this is a game, does not make me concerned with him having it (yes even at 22 I take notice LOL)",5,1,0,71,272,4,90,4,6,81.58,6.29,5.06,9.35
"GTA V is one of the best games out there, 6 years on and it still is nothing like it. The game is best played on the newer consoles or PC, but even playing on the PS3 or Xbox 360 is a fun-filled time, despite the lack of newer modes on the systems. The inclusion of heists, races and casino all add to sone fantastic fun and the Enterprise starter is a great way for those not familiar for the online component. A must own!!",5,1,0,86,330,7,114,4,8,72.87,8.44,5.39,11.86

"What can I say about this game that hasnt already been said. PERFECTION is the word comes to mind, while describing this game. Great story,missions,and the online feature is what really shines about this game. Yes its a very violent game, with strong language, and it wouldnt be a GTA game if it wasnt. Highly recommend this game, its perfection personified!",5,1,0,63,287,8,90,5,7,73.19,6.18,8.64,10.12
"PS4's version of GTA V, especially in this all encompassing, online play emphasizing version, and to this day, in my opinion, no game has come close to the fun that never gets old, playing GTA V. If you only have time in your life to indulge in one game, then this version of GTA V, specifically on the masterful PS4 (versus X-Box) is an absolute winner, especially for the price.",5,1,0,72,296,8,105,2,16,46.92,15.66,7.55,18.84

"The expansion is worth it to start your illegal businesses but youll want to purchase a better location once you accumulate enough money. The locations that come with this are far from the city which requires you to drive long distances. Its worth it to start up (and you get money).",5,1,0,51,228,7,74,3,9,66.83,8.16,8.75,12.29

"Great game but honestly not even sure that the premium online edition access code (that you pay extra for) is even valid. When redeemed it did not change up a thing or give any type of add-on.

Game should be band but these days people dont care about family morals and values which come from the Bible and thats why we have so much crazy young people these days, not because of the game but brcause of no family moral teachings/parenting at home.",1,2,8,61,260,5,84,2,14,59.38,12.55,8.29,15.48
"Better than previous gta game, except now you can switch characters on the fly. I prefer one character than control multiple people. Graphics even better than before. Voice acting and cut scenes top notch. Highly recommended!

"This game is fun on so many levels. The single player campaign is really good and don't forget about the multiplayer. The extra goodies it comes with for online is pretty cool as well, there is something for everyone when it comes to game modes.

I cant believe the difference between the two versions. The graphics/details are so much better and refined.

"This collection contains remastered versions of Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4, and Yakuza 5 that originally released on the PlayStation 3. Unlike the Kiwami games, these are not remakes. These are virtually the exact same games as what originally released except Yakuza 3 has restored content that had been cut for the original release and cleaned up scripts. This is also the first time Yakuza 5 has been available in a physical format in the west (it even includes a PS3 case of Yakuza 5 to help fill shelf gaps for folks that care about that sort of thing). While the games are a little dated compared to some of the modern releases, there is incredible value to this package as the writing holds up very well and there is a ton of content. Highly recommended!",5,4,0,135,606,20,211,6,11,51.77,11.63,9.28,14.93
"I Just picked this game up today. Now my Yakuza collection is complete",5,4,0,13,57,2,20,2,3,70.08,5.1,5.43,8.75
"Yakuza is one of the few series that age like wine. The story and combat do not feel archaic like many other remastered games. Although combat in 3 and 4 can feel stiff, they feel just right. The stories though are timeless, although I would write off Yakuza 4 as a first attempt at what they pulled off in Yakuza 5. Yakuza 3 is one of my favorites games of all time so getting to relive this in 1080p and smooth 60fps on my ps4 is awesome. I beat all 3 on my ps3, but the new coat of polish makes 3 and 4 feel like new games entirely although none look as good as Kiwami 2or Yakuza 6. Yakuza 5 feels like Yakuza 0 on the ps4.",5,3,0,128,489,14,172,7,6,74.59,7.4,5.04,11.69
"This is the game series you want all of. You can visibly see where the ambition of the developers allow them to reach new heights and offer more diverse gameplay options to players. Yakuza 5 is the crown jewel with 5 interwoven narratives each with their own mechanics. This game is invented the multiple protagonist mechanic that GTA V touts but with greater effect.",5,1,0,64,300,12,101,4,9,57.09,9.27,9.91,13.9

"Add Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 to your collection, which means now the series, 0-6 are on PS4. Awesome crime dramas that make you feel like you're in Japan and tons of things to do in these games. This specific collection though, is great. For those curious, 3 and 4 are on one disc with Yakuza 5 on a second. It even comes with a PS3 case for Yakuza 5 since that was the one never released on disc here in the US, which I thought was an amusing addition. I love being back to fill that gap in my collection with this release.",5,1,0,106,400,11,137,6,6,79.56,6.55,4.71,11.22
"These games are remasters of the PS3 yakuza games and they're good games if you haven't played them before. This collection comes with Yakuza 3, 4, and 5. I like that this came with a PS3 case of yakuza 5 (becasue we never got the Physical copy). Overall I think this is a great buy. Yakuza 3 has the cut content restored and all the games in the collection are now 1080p/60.",4,1,0,75,292,10,101,5,5,77.68,6.15,5.12,11.33

"First off the game is incredible and a welcome entry in the Doom franchise, I think it's the best one yet. The Mondo Steelbook is a work of art as well and absolutely worth buying at Best Buy over other retailers. This review would and should be 5 stars but unfortunately it didn't come with the promised pre-order bonus, Doom 64. I will update my review if this changes.",4,20,0,72,294,4,99,4,7,72.24,7.66,6.57,9.42
"Didn't come here to review a perfect game but to trash bestbuy for not including the rip and tear pack nor doom 64 been a longtime customer and understand covid19 is probably creating a bit of a mess right now but as a person who has shopped here for a longtime they need to address this",5,6,0,57,231,7,78,1,27,33.21,22.79,7.51,27.71
"Very excellent, though the arenas get repetitive and drag on a bit longer than they ought to sometimes; it does slow the pace a bit. More importanly, though, I preordered the Collector's Edition but I don't seem to have received a code for the Rip and Tear Pack. I've checked my email multiple times, even my spam folder, but there's just nothing.",4,5,1,66,273,8,92,3,10,66.58,9.44,7.18,13.65
"Terrible. Simply terrible game. I do not know why ppl are raving about it. I was a HUGE fan of 2016. The story was simple but immersive and fun. The environments were cool and reminiscent of ALIENS the movie and the hell levels were simply stunning. The weapons were fun. Eternal takes everything good about 2016 and overdoes it, makes it way cornier, crappy story, its designed for mindless people who just want flash and mindless, thoughtless action. Truly a disgrace to all the others.",1,2,0,85,391,8,128,9,5,69.85,5.86,8.11,7.54
"Doom Eternal must be one of the most graphic intensive game I've played. Several times I stopped to gaze at the back drop off what I was fighting at or in. The main issue is that at times, every new section or room you go into ends up being a big environmental puzzle to either get an item or open a door to proceed. Normally this really isn't an issue, but several times felt just as I finished an area and wanted to kill more demons, had to stop to figure out how to proceed further. Ugh!!! Kinda had the Tomb Raider feel where you have to solve a puzzle after killing enemies in a space. At one point I thought I was looking for tri-force. Oh and Doom guy is really good at gymnastics, who knew?! Maybe he should do the Olympics instead?",3,2,0,147,578,12,200,9,6,75.15,6.83,5.51,9.8

"I was a huge fan of DOOM 2016, It was my first Doom game. This improves on Doom 2016 with more enemy variety as well as new mechanics. If you're a fan of FPS games, then you should definitely give this game a try.",5,1,0,45,164,5,57,3,4,84.45,5.21,3.66,10.44
"Having loved Doom (2016) and ALL Doom games since the original came out when I was in high school, this one is near the top. While I love the updates to the 2016 Doom, the one thing that all critics have said is true: the platforming is at times awful and beyond angering. Super fast and fun gameplay, and if you loved 2016, you will love this, but be prepared for some VERY annoying platforming sections that did not bring down the perfect 2016 Doom.",4,1,0,85,356,7,109,3,13,69.59,10.59,7.78,14.63
"id Software practically invented the First Person Shooter. My, how the mighty have fallen. This game is for kids. I also NEVER RECEIVED my pre-order bonuses for ordering at BestBuy.com. As for the game, it's hard as nails. Even on the easiest level, there's limited ammo that requires constant weapon switches through a clumsy combination of button mashes. And in a major strategic error, DOOM Eternal has just as much swinging, jumping and climbing (and dying) as it does shooting. What a mistake! The AI is always OP, with you constantly being swamped by enemies that have unlimited ammo and are unreasonably hard to kill even on the easiest difficulty. Another major mistake. Average gamers will quickly tire of the nonsense of constantly dying over and over, and restarting checkpoints just because the difficulty if dialed up so high. That's for the highest difficulty levels, not the lowest. This game has been in our home for 2 weeks and nobody has even wanted to finish it...Despite being on Coronavirus lockdown for the entire time. Now it goes on eBay. The DOOM 64 pre-order bonus was one reason I purchased...But we never received it. I don't understand how a company can delay a game launch by 4 months and still screw up the pre-order bonuses?!? Buy and play DOOM 2016 if you haven't already. It's a much, much better game than this kids shooter!",2,1,0,245,1080,26,375,21,6,65.5,7.02,7.58,8.91

"I have yet to finish the single player portion of this game. While I will at some point, I am just not enthused about it. I recently borrowed Doom (2016) from a friend. I blew through it, it was a great run and gun experience. So one would think any improvement to this formula would also be a great game. This game is a mess!!! I would love to see the conversation around the planning table for this game. And who thought adding all of these convoluted game mechanics in was a good idea. Gone is the infinite ammo pistol so when you run out of ammo you automatically switch to your trusty chainsaw, which now is not so trusty. The chainsaw will mow down three of one type of enemy, only one of another type, and anything bigger then that they leave with your pants down and laugh at you. Haha you don't have enough fuel for this enemy. Now whether there is an upgrade to fuel capacity or not I do not know. But at the point I am in the game I find myself running out of ammo while toe to toe with a Hell Knight so to have this worthless thing pop up to do nothing. You now have a Predator style shoulder mounted grenade launcher, which is almost redundant to a shotgun upgrade. You can light enemies on fire to make them drop armor. You can glory kill enemies to charge your infinity-like gauntlet to unleash a smashing side slap that disses out 'massive' damage. Hey you like Assassin's Creed and parkour? Watcgph as we try to incorporate this into this 3D environment. Wall climb, and swing off pipes. Why? Good question. Certain enemies have weak point that you can shoot out, but in the midst of trying to set on fire, glory kill, super punch, not chainsaw, running out of ammo it gets cumbersome to shoot an antenna sized cannon of the back of the head of son of motherbrain. Bottom line, I do not enjoy this game. I hate the new play mechanics, the story is not explained at all how this connects to the previous game.",2,1,0,367,1515,30,503,24,6,75.36,6.55,6.54,9.39

"This is the definitive edition version of Mario Kart 8, and a must buy for those who never owned the Wii U version. For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version: 1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original 2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl) 3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item 4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth 5. 'Smart Steering' A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active. 6. 'Auto-accelerate' for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral 7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup 8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against 9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on 10. Online Play. -Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the 'Y' button during the course selection screen of an online lobby. - You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early -When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match - More icon packs for tournament mode 11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen 12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo 13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game 14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages 15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc) 16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match 17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types: -Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points. -Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell -Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs -Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out -Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it ==Additional notes: - There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps -There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players -Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse -No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down -No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo -Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced -Other balance changes: Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost. Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked. Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shell Easier to break while drifting (advanced tactic) -Luigi still has his signature death stare If there's anything I missed please put it in the comments. Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision",5,71,2,1236,5268,98,1715,67,8,70.72,7.98,7.66,10.55
"I've been playing Mario Kart since its inception on the SNES back in 1992. Perhaps that dates me a little bit, but don't be fooled: this old dog is a gamer and can still hang with the best of them. I've played almost every iteration of Kart pretty obsessively with the exception of just a few, so my experience with this franchise is quite extensive. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was simply great, right out of the starting gate. Our family purchased a Wii U a little bit late in its production cycle, and as such we started playing Mario Kart 8 only very recently. We went through most challenges of the game and unlocked just about everything that is unlockable. Shortly after that, we purchased our Switch. The first game we bought was Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, many of the unlockable rewards from Mario Kart 8 are already unlocked. Some may find this to be a treat, especially if coming from Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U where they don't want to be bothered to go through those challenges again. For others, particularly those who are new to Mario Kart 8 in general, that might leave the game a little bit unfulfilling. I'm somewhere in the middle of these two camps, as I feel that while even though the game is 'largely similar' it does have enough differences that -- to me -- constitute the need for starting the game at the same baseline as the Mario Kart 8 edition from Wii U and then being required to unlock everything again. You do still need to unlock many of the vehicle customizations, though. All that said, the characters, available bikes and karts, and all of the attributes of the various vehicles really showcase the depth and thought process that went into the driving aspects of Mario Kart 8. It's really quite unlike any Mario Kart game before it. I find it intriguing to see how people use the different combinations of characters, bikes/karts, tires, and gliders to create their ultimate racer. Back in the days of the original Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, you simply didn't have anything like that available. Interesting tidbit about the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe vehicles: changing your Mii in the Nintendo Switch console changes the available attributes of the vehicle that you can use when you choose your Mii character as a racer when you're in the vehicle selection screen. I'm a tall and thinner build in 'real life' but my Mii character on the Nintendo Switch console has a different body type because I want my Mario Kart vehicle to drive a certain way. Through a bit of trial and error, with which I am still experimenting, I have been able to create the ideal vehicle for me. Give it a shot! The online racing feature is greatly improved since the original Wii days. That is great to see. Nintendo has done a really nice job of making the online racing accessible, and I would venture a guess that more people are trying online racing (and online gaming in general) for the first time with this version of the game than in any Mario Kart titles prior to this one. The new tracks in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are absolutely TONS of fun. There is a nice range of very simple to very challenging. I don't know how the developers continue to reinvent the wheel regarding the multitude of great new tracks over the years, but they somehow do every time. The retro tracks are pretty cool to see, too. The one thing with the retro tracks is that they aren't particularly 'true' to the originals. While there might be many similarities, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe takes those tracks and adds many new spins on them. For those of us who remember those original tracks, that can be seen as a little bit of a surprise, as the tracks simply do not drive the same with all the new features. Still, though, it's pretty awesome that they recognized some of the classics and brought them into the mix with this newest version of Mario Kart. The Excitebike homage track was pretty darn cool, too. Considering that there have been so many releases of this game, it's amazing to see that the developers have been able to keep it fresh and innovative after 20-plus years. This game delivers on all of that and then some. I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves fun racing games, and/or is a Mario Kart aficionado. You simply will not be disappointed.",5,31,0,786,3405,88,1156,37,10,60.85,10.05,8.28,12.98
"Some of you may be familiar with MARIOKART 8 as it existed in the Wii U for almost 3 years now. If you are new to the game then I have to tell you that you are in for a treat. Welcome to Mario Kart 8 deluxe edition! What makes it deluxe? There were 2 packs of DLC (downloadable content) that added more tracks(48 total!), more racers(42 total!), more carts(40 total!), and added replayability to an already excellent game. Other than the aforementioned new carts and tracks, there are a few differences to note in this new version. There is a mode called auto steering that is default set on when you first start playing. This mode is akin to the bumpers that protect you from the gutter in bumper bowling, as it stops you from falling off the track and falling waay behind in the race. The sacrifice of having this mode on is that it will slow your cart down and/or redirect you to keep you on track. One of the biggest complaints is why this mode is auto set to be on? The answer however is simple, it's for kids and/or casual gamers so they jump in and not be overwhelmed right away by the complexity of some of the more difficult tracks. It's worth noting that this mode can be turned off before the race on the cart select screen. Hit or - and a small 3 option sub menu comes up below the carts stats. Hit L to deactivate auto steering, Y to activate physical driving (using the joy cons as a steering wheel), and R to activate auto accelerate, which I haven't used yet but I hear is pretty good. I feel this needs addressing most as this is the number 1 complaint I see online when it comes to the negatives of this game. It's relatively easy to shut off. Now back to the pros, which is basically the entire rest of the game, gain coins through racing or in the newly revamped battlemode to unlock new carts and custom parts for all of the carts. The battle mode has been redone as well, and makes the game that much more worth it. You can play multi player too, 4 players on one screen(which is tough in portable mode), or up to 8 if you and 7 friends all have a switch and mk8d... Online functionality is good but not great because Nintendo makes you jump through hoops to chat while you play. It doesn't bother me as I'm not one to chat with strangers online, bit I feel as though I'm in the minority on that line of thinking... It's yet to be said if there is to be any new DLC for this version but as it stands it's well worth your money and oh yeah... ITS PORTABLE!!! 3...2....1....GO! (get it)",5,29,0,497,1940,34,653,31,5,79.41,6.17,5.31,9.15
"Mario Kart 8 was such a good Mario Kart game I still considered it my favorite despite its lack of a proper battle mode and certain fan favorite characters. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe fixes some top complaints with Mario Kart 8 and adds new features on top of that. The new battle modes are a lot of fun. Balloon Battle and Coin Runners play like they did in Mario Kart Wii, and Shine Thief plays like it did in Double Dash. I did not find the new version of Bob-omb Blast to be *quite* as fun as the Double Dash version, but I was glad to see it return. The new Renegade Roundup mode plays like cops and robbers, and while it seems like the easiest to unbalance, it is still a lot of fun, and it feels fresh and different. While none of the race tracks are new, it is nice that Deluxe comes with all the tracks and CC levels unlocked (including the DLC tracks and 200cc). You do not get rewards for completing individual cups anymore, but as someone who already unlocked everything in MK8, it is nice to not have to unlock all the tracks and characters again. If you are someone who enjoys unlocking things, there ARE still locked vehicle partsincluding new Splatoon onesthat are unlocked by collecting coins. Even though the courses are the same, some of the new mechanics do make a difference. The most visible is the ability to carry two items at once. It allows some Double Dash strategies to return, but the inability to swap the item slots makes it feel more like dragging one item while having another in your item slot in other Mario Kart games. The item changes (and the introduction of the new Boo item) help give the first place player less of an advantage than in MK8 without feeling too unfair. Another new feature is the third level of mini turboit is difficult to drift that long on most courses, but the speed boost you get from it feels very satisfying. For advanced players, it sounds like a small change, but the ability to brake while drifting can actually really change how you play some tracksespecially in 200cc. For new players, auto steering and auto acceleration make learning the game much easier (though I wish the switches to turn them on and off were not hidden in the +/ menus). Overall, if you never played MK8, picking up Deluxe is a no-brainer. If you played MK8 and loved it, Deluxe is probably worth it for the new battle modes and the ability to play those courses on-the-go (spontaneous split-screen races in portable mode with Joy-Cons are still a lot of fun). If you hated the core gameplay of MK8, Deluxe does little to fundamentally change the formula, so you might want to try a friend's copy before deciding to buy. For me, this is probably my new favorite Mario Kart game.",5,29,2,502,2156,48,709,20,12,61.87,10.86,8.27,13.86
"TL;DR: This game is literally an enhanced port of the original Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U - with additional features and improved frame rate. Pros: Improved frame rate - especially in split-screen multiplayer, portable local multiplayer with multiple controller options, Battle Mode revamp, 8 player local co-op is possible, stat tiers have been fixed and stat points are no longer lost, Mario Kart is fun, very good purchase for those who never purchased the original. Cons: While 8 player co-op is possible, the game is a bit unclear at conveying that you require 4 Switch consoles to do so. Single joycon controls are the most economical choice to play with a lot of people, but they're fairly uncomfortable to play Mario Kart with. For veteran MK8 players, this is only an enhanced port - the only thing new is the battle mode and 1 new unlockable. Farming coins again can be a chore. Unlockables: most characters/stages/cc modes are unlocked at the start of the game to appeal to the market of players who originally purchased MK8 for the Wii U. There is 1 unlockable character (beat 200cc) and all karts/bikes/wheels/gliders must be unlocked by farming coins once again. Beating 150cc unlocks the gold cups/stars for 50cc and 100cc as well without having to play them. Additional features: DLC only characters and stages from the Wii U version are included. New and improved battle mode included, 8 player local co-op possible (requires 4 Switch consoles - can only do 2 player split-screen per console). Standard 4 player split-screen local co-op is possible on one console. New karts and stat overhaul. Personal review: As a veteran of MK8 Wii U, I purchased this strictly for the ability to play this portable with friends. As I had already unlocked everything and played the original MK8 to death, I found myself not being as immersed in playing single player since I had already 3 starred every track in all modes including 200cc in original MK8 and I got bored quickly and lost interest playing by myself. Online matchmaking is still fun and the new battle modes did warrant a good purchase in my book. The biggest draw was the ability to bring my Switch anywhere and able to set up Mario Kart at parties and game nights for casual and competitive play with friends, only to lose those friendships shortly after over a horribly timed blue shell. I would 110% recommend this to someone who has never played MK8 before, but I would only recommend this to a MK8 veteran only if the things I wrote in the above 'Pros' section appeal to them - otherwise, just stick with the Wii U version.",5,21,0,461,2080,56,694,18,13,53.48,12.16,9.57,15.1
"Let's see where do I begin! Well first of all, I'll tell you I do own the Wii U version and that I am a double dipper if you happen to be one of those on the fence wether to buy it or now still. This game freshens it up. All tracks plus DLC, Characters, parts, karts, and bikes. Butter smooth 60 FPS. Real battle modes and pretty good online play. (needs a touch work but nonetheless works great) Everything is unlocked form the start. All Modes 50cc-200cc with all characters. You can just dive right in! I've raced this game to death on the Wii U and somehow this feels refreshed as if it were a whole new game! So if your a new comer this game will easily give you hours and hours of enjoyment for your whole Switch life cycle! Racing, Time Trials, Battle modes, Online play, its all here. Trust me, this is a game that you'll love to play with friends even if they are not a gamer. Everyone knows Mario Kart. So grab some friends, have a party and get to having a blast!",5,21,1,195,752,8,241,15,4,89.08,4.06,4.6,6.84
"I fell in love with Mario Kart on the N64. I put countless hours into mastering every track, on every difficulty level, and loved few things more than Mario Kart tournaments with my friends and siblings. Even to this day I break out that old game console and challenge my nephews to a race. When I finally decided to get myself a Nintendo Switch, my first new gaming console since my N64, I knew right away that this was going to be my first game purchase, just like it was back in 1997. I have not been disappointed. The first notable difference from my Mario Kart of old is the sheer scale of this game. It is simply so much bigger. More racers on the track at a time, more characters to choose from, more kart options (and upgrades!), and way, way, WAY more tracks to compete on. I've been playing this game for a few weeks now and still have really only raced on about 2/3rds of the tracks so far. And as a bonus for us old-time Mario Kart drivers, many of the tracks are throwbacks to those on earlier systems. Only now apparently now you can race on the walls and ceilings too, which is still a little mind-boggling to me, and an interesting twist visually. But where this game really shines is in when you get a few friends together and face off against them. The multi-player options are pretty expansive too, with several multi-player game modes to choose from. Battle mode is a heck of a lot more chaotic with 12 characters in the arena as compared to the 4 I was used to, but I haven't decided yet if that's a downside or not. But my personal favorite way to play, just as it was before, is a good old-fashioned race with a four-player split screen. Even my non-gaming mother-in-law is having a good time watching this one! Definitely pick up this title... and don't forget to grab a second set of joy-cons. You're going to be glad you had them for this title!",5,19,0,366,1465,29,492,20,7,74.54,7.41,6.12,10.49

"I've been wanting to get Mario Kart 8 since the Wii U, but never had the chance to get it. I'm glad I waited and got the Deluxe version of Mario Kart 8 for the Nintendo Switch. It's so much fun playing Mario Kart 8 on the go! :) The graphics look beautiful in 1080p HD. The new racing tracks are really creative. There are some returning retro tracks that have been completely revamped for Mario Kart 8, such as Moo Moo Meadows (Wii), Yoshi's Circuit (GameCube), and Music Park (3DS). **DLC & MORE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS!** It adds all the DLC packs that were released on the Wii U. Plus, more characters have been added to Mario Kart 8. They added Inkling Girl and Inkling Boy with different color schemes to choose from, Bowser Jr., King Boo, Dry Bones, and an alternate costume for Link (Breath of the Wild tunic) - which was a free update that was added recently. **IMPROVED BATTLE MODES!!** The Battle modes on the Wii U were just reusing the racing tracks which made it too big to chase after other players. It seemed like battle mode was an afterthought and Nintendo realized they needed to add battle modes for when Mario Kart 8 was first released on the Wii U. In the Deluxe Edition, the battle modes are much better and they created some new battle modes. The arenas are smaller, like in previous Mario Kart games. One of the new battle maps has a Splatoon themed arena. Returning modes are Popping Balloons and Bob-omb Blast **CONTROLS** The controls feel great. There's even a new Smart Steering feature which makes driving and staying on the track easy for those who normally don't play video games that much. Nintendo even added more controller options such as Nintendo Labo Motorcycle and Vehicle. Overall, I had a lot of fun playing this game and I recommend this to anyone who likes racing games. Fun to play on your own or play with your friends and family!",5,16,0,342,1469,33,485,22,7,71.08,7.21,7.55,10.08
"I have been playing Mario Kart since the SNES days. Mario Kart 64 was the first of the series I purchased with my hard earned money from my first job that I played for months on end. I admit that having previously purchased Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U there was some hesitation in buying the new 'remastered' game. But in all Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's seemingly small feature upgrades add a lot to the game. In my case the updates were well worth the double dip. If you've been away from the series and or missed it entirely on Wii U there should be no question on whether to buy (so long as you enjoy the racing, kart genre). But if you are on the fence consider the following: -Eight battle stages with four modes. This was the greatest omission from the Wii U version that is rightly fixed now. The modes are great, with Renegade Roundup being the new addition and my personal favorite. -Full 1080p 60fps on TV and 720p 60fps on the go. It ran at 720p 59fps on Wii U. So the game is sharper and very smooth running on the Switch. Multiplayer dips to 30fps with three or four players, but no different than Wii U. -Best handheld iteration of a Mario Kart ever made. -Double item blocks return, you can now get a defensive item and a coin or two defensive items. This really does make the game much better. -New characters and karts: Dry Bones, Bowser Jr. Inkling Boy, Inkling Girl. There is one additional character that is unlocked by getting a gold cup on every cup available, I won't spoil it here.

"There isn't much to dislike here. The gameplay is solid, the track designs are beautiful, and the replay ability is endless. With the Switch, you can play Mario Kart with someone anywhere you are because the joycons can be used as two controllers. I visited a girl in the hospital, and brought it with me, and we played this game together.

"It's the tried and true Mario Kart formula, but what they did to differentiate this version from the Wii U version is that players have the ability to hold two items now, there are battle arenas, and all DLC is included and unlocked. One feature I particularly like (don't know the official name) is that the game will either steer the kart or accelerate for you if it notices you're not doing one or the other (this is ticked on by default). This has helped my young niece actually stand a chance at competing, providing a more enjoyable time for her.",5,5,0,104,438,13,150,3,16,49.63,14.95,8.11,18.87
"First, if you aren't a gamer member with Bestbuy you are throwing money away every time you buy a game. This game has everything! It's especially fun once you master the steering wheel(sold separately) and don't need to use the directional buttons. The switch joy con is made to fit hands that are roughly the size of Trumps hands. If you have anything larger than a toddlers hand when playing with the joy con you need the steering wheel. There are tons of characters and vehicles to choose from. So many upgrades. The game is set up for the most novice players to the extremely talented with all the classes and cups available. Better option for party's of adults or children than 1-2 switch. Adults only below this...... Trying playing Drunk Cup The rules are: You are not allowed to drink and drive. You must pull over to drink. You must finish your adult beverage before finishing the race. Good luck!!!!",5,4,0,167,718,13,232,14,5,77.2,5.45,7,7.89
"First off let me say that I bought and played this game since day 1 it was released back on the Wii U so I have already put many hours into it before now. That being said even if you bought and played this on the Wii U it is well worth the price of picking up again on the switch. The battle mode is the biggest improvement over the Wii U version, but not the only one. Switch version runs at 1080p vs 720p on Wii U, it comes with all the paid DLC and of course the best feature... you can play it anywhere you want via handheld mode and it is absolutely gorgeous in handheld mode and on a TV. If you have never played.... buy it yesterday.... if you have it on Wii U... still buy it. As always I would recommend anyone buying video games to get the BestBuy Gamer club, it provides great year long discounts and since I have joined BestBuy is pretty much only place I get any physical games anymore.

It has a new battle mode that you can play objective style games like cops and robbers or trying to pop as many balloons tied to other karts as possible without getting losing any of your own. It's has a great single player mode as well, and you can earn special gold reskins from completing many of the single player races/times.",5,2,0,92,379,6,127,4,10,66.71,9.67,7.14,11.81

"Even though this initially seems like just a re-release of Mario Kart 8, or at best a game of the year edition since it includes all previously released DLC on Wii U, this is rather much more. Having played and completed every single Mario Kart released, this one has the best features of all games, and combines them in Mario Kart 8 as a base. Holding one item and keeping another in item slot is back, and so is Battle Mode. Multiple modes are feature in Battle (8 arena maps), and all addicting and fun to play online or with friends over splitcreen and even with multiple Nintendo Switches together. Racing is as solid as ever, featuring all tracks (48 tracks total for racing), including DLC ones from Mario Kart 8. Screen resolution is now 1080p in TV mode, with perfect fluid 60 frames per second when playing from 1 to 2 players, and a solid 30 frames when playing 4 in splitcreen. Game is excellent for hard core fans of the series since it features best item combinations and mechanics, and features optional steering and acceleration assists for those still learning the mechanics.",5,3,1,195,876,21,292,7,14,51.88,12.94,9.55,15.45

"As like most, I had high expectations for this game for the Switch. However, I wasn't satisfied and felt the previous Olympic games were much better. It made me want to go back and play the Winter Olympic games on the Wii/DS instead because those games were more fun to me than this one. The retro part seemed pretty cool at first but I never felt a good connection with it and felt it wasn't exactly necessary. Only a small selection of games are retro too. There are many ways to play the games, but the instructions aren't always clear. The motion controls were pretty difficult. I'm just glad that every game includes the option to play the games using only buttons on the controller instead of motion control. The story mode is ok. There are a lot of objects and when speaking to NPCs they give you historical information about Tokyo itself and the real Olympic games. Seems pretty cool at first but there appears to be a lot so I tend to skip them over eventually or just not speak to them anymore. The cool parts were information about the playable characters. Most of the games I felt after playing it once was fun and that was just it for me. Overall, it is nice side game, especially if you love the Mario and Sonic series but I can't justify purchasing for full price for it.",3,6,1,244,1024,24,341,14,8,70.91,7.7,7.18,10.91
"I've played most of the Mario and Sonic games since they were introduced on the Wii and feel this is one of the, if not the strongest contender. From the onset you can choose how you want to play. You can start a story mode that takes you on an adventure through the 1964 Tokyo, or play any and all of the Olympic games available. There are quite a few including 10 retro games that are very fun. They can be played with motion (waiving the controller around) or classic controls (button presses) which is a fun option. If you're looking for a good multiplayer game this one is worth considering, and most games can be played with one joy-con to each player.",5,4,0,126,520,9,164,6,9,75.41,7.96,7.06,11.26

"This game is quite fun and in the footsteps of its previous versions. However if there was 1 improvement i would recommend that they update with a Olympics mode as all the events are single events and have to always select the next event, would be nice to have a mode that has events all lined up for continuous uninterrupted play.",4,3,0,61,268,7,88,2,15,53.83,13.33,9.06,16.79
"If you've ever played a Mario and Sonic game before, you know what you are in for. However, there are some really cool additions to this game that brings it to the top of my list. To start out, I did purchase this game at $34,99 on a sale price. I think $60 is a lot BUT if you can get it cheaper, I recommend that. There is also a demo in stores that you can go try and see if you like it. This game has a fun single player campaign where you not only play through the story but also get to learn a lot of facts about Japan and the Olympics. There is also a new mode where you go back in time and play as the classic sprites of the SNES/NES/GENESIS era, which as a lifelong gamer who grew up in that era, was a real treat! The games themselves are hit and miss and you'll quickly find ones you enjoy playing and others you'll only play when the game makes you. We also played this with friends and that's where the real fun is at. Getting together and playing Mario and Sonic with a group is just as fun as Mario Party where you'll be either using the motion controls or button controls to best each other in various Olympic events. All in all, it's a fun game that would be best at a cheaper price. Again, if you are on the fence, go to your local store with a kiosk and give it a try! :)",4,2,0,270,995,9,338,13,7,79.85,7.28,4.44,9.64
"Not worth the price. The story mode is very short and will take you about 2 to 3 hours to finish. If you can get it at a discount then I would recommend it for the casual mini games.",4,2,0,39,141,2,50,3,3,85.18,4.61,3.18,7.25

We only get a handful in this game. I was expecting more since is has the PGA sponsorship now. What it does have over previous versions is that the gameplay and controller motions are much better / more true. Ive enjoyed playing it. I like a good console golf game and this is the best out there right now. I still would love to see that last version of EASports TW come back on PS4 though.

"This is your typical golf game, but the quality of the graphics and the challenge to hit the perfect ball what makes this game different. You really feel you are at the course. They have license from PGA Tour, but unfortunately, not the license from the major tournament courses or the players. Though getting to play TPC Scottsdale for the WM Phoenix Open with its iconic 16th hole, that raises the bar for other golf games. If they could come to an agreement with the PGA Tour players association for next version, you could be actually playing the real players on the tour. I really like this game.",5,1,0,108,483,12,156,6,9,66.37,8.47,8.85,11.64
"am only in my infancy on The Golf Club 2019 and have fortunately never owned a previous version of this series, so the initial selling price doesn't put me off as much as it will others. Overall I am very impressed with the game and expect I will find it very challenging for many months to come. If you enjoy watching or playing golf then you will enjoy what is in essence this golf simulation. What the previous owners of the PGA Tour license did with their games was a disgrace, making arcade golf game time after time, similar to how they treat other modern sports. Hopefully the new license can be expanded to further courses in the future but having paid the full value for the initial game I will not be spending on any future possible add ons. I will enjoy what I have. A solid golf game with endless playability.",4,1,0,154,658,14,222,7,10,62.55,10,7.98,12.44
"Not for the faint of heart, this is a challenging golf game. It is more of a golf simulation than an arcade type game, this is not the Tiger Woods games of old. Personally I really like the game, and the collection of user made courses is fantastic and huge. The PGA aspects need to be expanded, no PGA golfers and the tour calendar has only a few licensed courses. It would be great if you could choose the courses for the tour schedule. The graphics could be improved, and the developers really should move to a better graphics engine, considering where console gaming is today. All of that being said, I really love playing this game. The challenge, and you can adjust the swing difficulty by the club set you choose, provides a sense of reward when you are successful, unlike the old EA games which you could master in a few weeks and then shoot 20 under par per round.

Great visuals, smooth and as true to life as is available. One suggestion to John, the commentator.

"I am huge fan of the MLB the Show franchise. I preorder every year's edition and eagerly await release day ('opening day!'). The game is generally very good again and I have already devoted around 100 hours in just 10 days to playing it, so it must not be that bad. I pretty much only play Road to the Show and Franchise modes, so I'll cover each briefly... RTTS is not much different from previous editions, which does not make it bad. I was bothered by the fact that there were a lot of bugs with the logic for presenting stats and such. I would often see a player come to bat and it would show an entirely different (usually the last batter's) stats. Not a deal breaker, but hurts the presentation of the game. I was also bothered by the ridiculous decisions that 'teams* made during the off-season. For example, the Orioles organization currently has a top ten prospect in 2019 1st overall pick Adley Rutschman. They have complete control over Jim for at least 6 years, but despite being the worst team in the league, they allowed him to leave after 1 year and sign with another team. If your a simulation game, you should try to simulate. There is no way this would happen! You gotta get closer to reality. Franchise modes seems to actually have improved the decision making of teams. I used to be able to easily mill other teams in trades to quickly and vastly improve my team. I can still make trades, but they seem to require more reasonable offers now. That's a good thing as it increases the challenge. I also think that the draft process seems far more reasonable than in past years with less (more reasonable number of) high quality players. You can quibble all you want about player ratings, improvements and the like. We all have our opinions on that stuff. I don't fault how it came out. I also LOVE that San Diego Sports finally added the minor leaguers. I'm a fan of pro baseball and pay some attention to those things, so having the real minor leaguers instead of made up players is a huge advancement for me! YMMV. Overall, I still really enjoy the game. Some bug fixes and improvements to front office logic and I would have given it 5 stars and them some.",4,3,1,406,1719,43,578,28,6,71.68,6.86,7.05,10.04
"MLB The Show is back with another great yearly installment. For the first time ever, minor league rosters are included. This makes the game even more realistic.

"I've been playing borderlands on and off for a couple weeks now. I haven't finished it yet, but I feel I've gone far enough to give a fair enough commentary of it. If you're a fan of the previous entries in the series, then you're going to like this one too. If borderlands was fun for a play through, but hard to come back to then you might find this game has worn out its welcome a bit. To explain, I feel that this is the apex borderlands game. All the writing, action, and loot is exactly what you'd want from borderlands and is done at a consistently high level. The problem lies in how you feel about borderlands in general. If you feel like the jokes get old and the combat is repetitive; if the thought of loot farming doesn't excite you, then this game probably won't either. The frame drops and random lag when navigating menus and maps certainly doesn't help things, but could possibly be sorted out through future patches. Right now it's not frequent enough to put me off entirely, but it does pull me out of the experience enough times to worth mentioning. Overall the game is lots of fun if you want a run and gun loot fest with some sillier throwback jokes thrown in. If that doesn't sound great, then it's probably not for you. But if it does, then you'll get more than your money's worth.",4,2,0,258,1023,20,335,13,8,76.84,7.47,6.02,11.04

"If you loved Borderlands, Borderlands 2, and the Pre-Sequel - you will love Borderlands 3. I installed the game on Friday night at 7pm, it's now 10am Sunday and I've put over 15 hours into the game. This is an excellent addition to the series. The gunplay feels better than ever, movement has been improved, driving is better and there are even new vehicles and customization options. On the bad side, there are some performance issues (playing on a PS4 pro). I've experienced frame rate drops, freezing and stuttering when opening and navigating the menus and inventory, and problems with the jump and climb mechanic newly introduced to the series. Speaking of the inventory system, it needs work. Comparing stats of items in your inventory is not intuitive at all. The quest tracking system is also dated and needs work (multiple quests tracked at once would be nice). I still give this game a 4.0/5 as it's extremely fun with an incredible replay value.",4,1,0,170,762,22,257,11,8,63.25,8.28,8.64,11.36

"I have the PS4 version and had played through it before but didnt really find it to be very entertaining. It felt like a chore to have to complete all those quests when I played it on the PS4. Playing it again on the Switch offered an entirely new perspective even though its the same game I played years ago. Im enjoying this game so much more on the Switch and this time through I find myself looking forward to completing all the quests, including those optional secondary quests! Theres something about the Switch that makes this game better. Im thinking maybe its the Switchs ability to put the system to sleep and lets you come back to right where you left off without having to wait for the system to reload. Maybe thats it. As for the Switch version, even though many previous reviewers compared it unfavorably to the other console versions, at least graphically, I still really cant notice the difference. I mean youd have to really put both versions in front of you in order to be able to tell. Even if you were to do so (you actually can by watching those comparison videos on youtube), the difference is not that significant to be worthy of the average persons concern. This is still a very pretty game on the Switch. There are occasional crashes but that doesnt happen too often. In fact, I remember this game crashed a few times on the PS4 too. Im a bigger Witcher fan now that I played this game on the Switch. Just in time for the Witcher series debut on Netflix in a few more weeks.",5,7,0,277,1200,25,389,15,9,69.28,8.18,8.07,11

"The witcher 3 itself is one of my favorite games of all time. I have over 300 hours logged on my PC version, but bought this version so I could play on the go as well as I wanted to support CD Projekt Red. The game on the switch seems very stable and locked around 30fps with minor dips, but nothing too noticeable. NPC counts seem to be around the same number as on other platforms. The game is slightly blurry because of the low resolution, but in handheld which I primarily play, it doesn't take you out of the game. It helps that the game is so immersive as well. Overall it was an incredible port for the Switch, and it's amazing they even got this thing to run at all, let alone how well it actually does.",5,5,0,141,558,9,190,7,8,72.39,8.17,6,10.61

"As a dad I don't get nearly as much PC gaming time. When I do it it is playing games with one of my two sons (daughter likes to play talking Beanie Boos not many games). I have played through 60% of the Witcher 3 when it came out in 2015 and bought but didn't have time to play the DLC. On my 1080Ti the game looks amazing at 4K... The issue is most of the time I have 'gaming' time..I don't play on the PC but my Switch in handheld so I can hangout with my wife watching hot trash on TV (90 Day F is fun to laugh at). So I usually grab my Switch and play Civ or BOTW until this came out. I have played in both Handheld (primarily) and on my 4K set. Yes the game is downgraded (esp from the my PC) but still LOOKS amazing esp considering it is running on a mobile CPU and GPU (Tegra) and the full game is here... The story doesn't suffer from this downgrades and the game plays amazing pretty much floating at 30hz 90% of the time. If you have a PS4 or PC and don't need portable access..get it there but if you have a Switch and play handheld..this game really feels like magic. The story is crazy good and the visuals are a knockout on the Switch compared to every other game. It runs better then I could have ever dreamed and after 30 mins you won't even notice the visual downgrade (minus some pop in during cut scenes). Well worth the buy and will keep me busy for 120 hours for the next 3 months. PS. Support CDProjekt Red for they truly believe in what makes gaming great: no loot boxes, great content, FREE post support content and DRM free future (they own gog.com and only sell DRM free on PC).",5,4,0,328,1234,12,414,19,5,82.53,6.04,4.61,8.37

The Witcher 3 has hundreds of hours of gameplay and is one of the most demanding ports attempted on Switch. To achieve this handheld mode runs at 540p with a stable 20-30 FPS.

"Wanted to be able to play Witcher 3 but didnt have a PC that could handle the graphics or a console. After a long time debating whether I should buy the Switch or not, I finally decided to go for it since it could run Witcher 3. I absolutely love the game. Hard core gamers need to know that obviously the graphics arent going to be as good as on a PC or on PS4/Xbox but thats not the point. Its absolutely great that the developers made this port for people who want to play but dont necessarily have a good enough Pc or not that interested in buying a console for the TV. Being able to go from playing Witcher 3 in bed, then the couch, then on the TV for a bit, and then back in bed in handheld mode is absolutely brilliant. The graphics are great!

I've waited for this due to the length of the game (over 150 hours to see most of it) and I just didn't have that kind of time to sit on a couch and play, but play on my commute? So great for that. Please note, this is not a game for kids. Clearly it has an M rating but it really takes that to a high level, so really be to go with perhaps Skyrim if you'd looking for an RPG for a slightly younger gamer (even though that has M as well). The biggest concern from gamers who have played this on other systems often pertains to the graphics. I have played this on other systems, and while yes, the difference is vast, it's not something you'll likely think about, especially not while in handheld mode. I really thought it'd bother me but it doesn't at all because, at the end of the day, this is a great looking game and the performance doesn't suffer at all. Can't recommend picking this up enough and supporting CDPR (the people that made the game).",5,1,0,210,794,10,269,9,9,74.78,8.63,5.16,11.24

The game I got came with a little map of the world and booklet explaining a little about the story and its characters. There were also two little stickers of the school of the wolf logo (still getting the hang of the lingo). I got this on Black Friday for $15 off.

"Don't get me wrong, I like this game a lot and it does bring back memories from when I played it on PC. But I don't think playability factors into this game as much as the poor graphical/audio performance on the Switch. It's a port of the game in the lowest graphical quality with some audio bugs during combat that turns it off for me and Nintendo needs to allow it to reach it's peak for quality. You go from playing it in max graphics to playing at minimal graphics.... it's a huge turn off and I feel like I wasted money.

The auto aim & hit detection will do ALL the work. I played 2 rounds doing this & went 24-4 & 26-2 with 25 headshots even though I was aiming mostly at feet.

I bought Black Ops hoping it would be different and it was just ok. I bought MW3 with high hopes of a game that i would not tire of in a few hours. I was wrong. Then Black Ops 2 was released and all the major internet review sites said. 'This is the Call of Duty game that will make you into the series again and if you have never played one, this is the one!'. Well I can personally say that this game did not do anything to get me back into the series or even open my game that I purchased. Let me just say this; if you were getting bored of Call of Duty before and had high hopes that this was the one that would revamp the series, look to another game for entertainment. Its that same game that is set in the future. I tried but I just couldn't like the series again.",2,23,10,232,868,10,291,15,4,85.02,5.24,4.29,7.91

"I was hoping this CoD would be an answer to MW3, but sadly it is far from it, maybe even a step back. The new concept of the 10 point system and the point streaks are great, but they didn't focus on the actual gameplay. The accuracy/consistency of the game is off. Blame it on lag or whatever but even in killcam's there are no hit markers while you are aimed at a target but rather a little bit to the right of the target. There are times when you could kill in three shots sometime NOT kill them with 6 shots and sometimes die without being shot. Something is very wrong there. Random/Problem/Closed lobbies. This has happened a lot for me. Having the party end randomly, or being in a lobby with your friends and then somehow being put in a game without your party. I don't know what you would blame that on except jenky development. The league play will not work. Tried for 30 minutes to get in and played one match. Again something is broken. Another issue has been the servers being down! it seems like it is always down and it is very, very frustrating to pay for a game that you cannot even play. Another weird issue is, if you have a later version you cannot join a lobby or vise versa. A small side note: if you are a Hardcore mode player, there are only FOUR(4) HC modes, TDM, S&D, FFA, and CTF. This is very disappointing to me, especially after David Vonderhaar said that they will place a bigger emphasis on HC modes than any other CoD. To give FOUR modes is a freakin joke. You still can tube in HC though it does seem like tubes have been nerfed dramatically from MW3 or maybe it's just inconsistent like bullets. Being that the game is so inconsistent, it is hard to like the game. It is very frustrating to play and would not recommend this game for it's multiplayer content. As for the campaign mode, I don't know, I played 20 minutes of it and it did not interest me much. I don't think it's enough to know if it's good or bad. I was one to hope and pray this CoD was better than the one before, but sadly it's just another CoD.",2,19,10,407,1599,23,540,25,6,78.07,6.42,5.48,8.77
"I guess they didn't learn their lesson from MW3. I agree with just about everyone on this review board. I find this game to be fairly easy in multiplayer, but the bad out weighs the good. The new perk system is nothing special. Personally I don't like the gun selection. Spawns are HORRIBLE!!; it seems like in every game it stops during the middle of a match ' Migrating Hosts'. There is a ton of lag and most of the time my signal is all the way up. Quickscoping is so screwed up, im sorry but if you buy this game just to run around with a sniper rifle you're a loser. I can keep going on and on. I haven't got into the campaign yet. Zombies are okay I guess; it's different from the other black ops zombies, but zombies is not as spectacular as they were making it out to be. I mean come on, all that hype for zombies and they give us this????? I hope this fix this game. If they don't then people are better off saving their money and buying the first Black Ops because there is not much difference, or you can buy Halo 4 which is what im probably going to do.",3,20,12,215,821,11,278,15,4,82.9,5.26,4.59,7.78

They are still running the servers from the original black ops it seems like. My friends and I get kicked from parties when we try to join eachother, and we cant even find a game. This is definitely not worth the time or money. The campaign is good, but yet like alot of the others said, its in the 80s where it was suppose to be in the future. The spawning in this game is 10x worse than Modern Warfare 3, and the bullet damage is crazy. I can get 10 hit markers on a person when all i see is their head, but they can shoot me once and I die, from a gut shot.",2,21,14,152,554,3,181,9,5,88.95,5.05,3.88,7.55

I most enjoyed the zombie mode but it's also really fun playing online with friends or at home with friends. The combination of futuristic and modern weapons was really cool. I feel like they captured what futuristic weapons will really be like.

Their horrible lag compensation makes the multiplayer darn near impossible to play. Their 'new' (see:Terrible) spawn system makes it worse. People buy COD game because of the multiplayer, but stick with MW3 or go buy Halo 4. Treyarch has made no attempt to fix it, nor will they. I'd go on, but it doesn't matter. You're going to buy your kid this game anyway because it is a Call of Duty and Activision/Treyarch will continue to make billions on garbage like this.",1,22,16,108,462,12,147,8,6,77.98,5.74,7.16,9.84
"I was really looking forward to this game, but there have been no improvements from the first Black Ops. Modern Warfare 3 has a lot better graphics. In Black Ops 2 even the cut scenes for the campaign were terrible- not to mention the story for the campaign. Also, the game keeps having server issues (in multiplayer) which is frustrating when you are in the middle of a match. They do not have a dedicated server-not that they did for the first one, but still... I see no improvements. Think I'll just play Halo 4...",2,19,13,97,404,7,130,7,6,79.39,5.63,6.55,8.43

The guns look better and the Campaign is quite a bit harder than MW3. For the price, you'll get a lot of hours out of this game with the multiplayer. Online play can get repetative but I can't wait for the new maps. If you hate the game, don't play it. There are a ton of players online to play against so obviously its a better game than the reviews its getting on here, if you don't compare it to anything.

"OK, first of all this review is OBVIOUSLY entirely my humble HONEST opinion, you can take it with a grain of salt for all I care but, I just wanted to put my two cents in. Also this is coming from an adult gamer and not some screaming 12 year old fanboy. I have every previous COD game going back to the PS2 including the original COD and all the Modern Warfare games etc...and this is one of the more stellar editions in the series. One of the things that stands out most in my mind is the map design. The campaign is one of the most riveting stories of any other COD game to date, albeit you need to follow it very carefully because of the many twists and turns through out the game. It was awesome having the choices you made through out the main story affect the ending to this game, I wont say any more so as to not spoil it for others. Now on to the multiplayer, in my opinion this game has some of the best multiplayer maps of the whole COD/MW series. I really like the variation in elevation in some of the outdoor maps. The new perk system is also refreshing as well, combat training made a return a feature I loved in Black Ops (I get to play MP with my kids without actually being online). . Overall I am very pleased and somewhat surprised at how well this game turned out.",5,2,0,252,1011,20,343,12,8,70.37,8.66,6.38,11.57
"This is a great game. Even for beginners. Great storyline.",5,2,0,10,46,2,16,3,2,68.09,4.59,2.37,9.33
"I'm a fan of the Call of Duty Franchise, and usually find myself pre-ordering COD games. Campaign: Activision did a great job with with campaign mode-You can customize a class before each mission, choosing primary and secondary weapons, lethal and tactical equipment (semtex, flashbang, combat axe, etc.) and basic perks. The choices you make during the campaign; missions you complete successfully or fail; will change the storyline dramatically, which gives the game great replay value. The storyline switches between The Cold War (late '80s) and The Second Cold War, which takes place in the future (2025). This gives the game a great dynamic, allowing you to use guns and equipment available during the '80s and 2025 as well. Multiplayer: Multiplayer is well balanced in this installment of the COD franchise. Players are able to build a custom class with two weapons per class, perks, and equipment. Each class is limited to 10 items per class, i.e., you can equip 1 primary weapon with 2 attachments, 1 secondary weapon with 1 attachment, 3 perks, 1 lethal grenade, and 1 tactical grenade. Black Ops 2 brings a new twist to the multiplayer mode with 'Wildcards'. Three Wildcards can be equipped per class (each taking up 1 space out of the 10 slots given). Wildcards can allow you to equip a fourth perk, an additional lethal grenade, or a primary weapon as your second gun. Guns, equipment, and perks are unlocked with 'tokens' given per level up. Black Ops 2 also offers 'League Play' games, which give you access to all guns, equipment, and attachments from the get-go. League Play has limited game modes, but I find this much more enjoyable than Public Games. Some equipment is limited in League Play matches, such as under-barrel grenade launchers-so you don't have 'Noob Tubers' running around throughout the levels randomly blowing you up, which some might consider aggravating. One thing about the multiplayer experience in Black Ops 2 that I have the displeasure of experiencing twice is a major bug that Activision has yet to fix. If you play online, you should try to avoid playing local matches. Playing a local match can (and most probably will) corrupt your online multiplayer data, which will reset your classes, tokens, player card unlocks, and reset your prestige. Activision does fix this issue if you submit an online form with your information-they say it should take 24 hours, but both times I've faced this issue, I received support after a week. There is one way to avoid this issue-Stay away from playing local matches on your gamertag/xbox. Overall, Black Ops 2 is a great game. Campaign mode has a great replay value, and completing challenges during campaign mode does lead to equipment unlocks to use in the campaign. I find myself playing multiplayer on Xbox Live with friends, so the persistent glitch of classes and player data being reset is a pain in the butt. Zombies mode can be fun, but it is a game mode I don't spend much time playing. I would recommend this game to friends, just with the advice that they should steer clear of local games until Activision does something about the player data reset glitch.",3,4,2,546,2517,57,807,28,11,62,9.46,9.79,11.98
"I have been buying COD since Modern Warfare (#4). I do not like the futuristic feel to this game. This game is difficult to play. Kill times are very fast and the maps are too small. There is a lot of head-camping style gameplay from players online, people are either cheap like that or the maps encourage it. I preferred the original Black Ops, MW2, and MW3. The zombies game is just ok. Prefer der riese and kino der toten. The most positive aspect to the game is the campaign.

"This game is a terrible multiplayer, first off it is all based on the internet connection you have; a three round burst gun is like a shotgun from far away if you are host and have the best connection. SMG's are unstoppable especially around all the close cornered maps the creators had to make this year. Snipers are unbeatable they can be used from far away and don't even have to hit you to get the kill just come close around you and can quick scope up close for a one shot kill. For as much as this game wants to be like real warfare I'd like to see someone running around with a sniper and having the advantage in close combat. The shock tactical with the bouncing betty is an automatic kill. Let's see what else is unrealistic? Well personally I like to run around in video games and not stay behind cover looking down my scope waiting for someone to walk thru it but apparently with our 'perks' we have the ability to see devices thru walls yet don't have the ability to run for 15 seconds without taking a breather. All I have to say is good luck having fun playing this game especially once you finally have a good game and you get booted because the poor connection!",1,24,22,227,939,22,313,8,13,61.38,11.75,7.48,15.23

"(I re-bought this after trading my original copy in when my Xbox 360 failed many years ago). I loved the singleplayer campaign featuring memorable characters and an interesting take on what to expect five years from today (and, so far, was the only game in the series where you could make choices that impact the ending). I also loved the introduction of the 'Pick any 10' create-a-class system bringing a fresh take to multiplayer, scorestreaks (which award you for playing the objective instead of just getting kills online) and the return of zombies mode.

I couldnt belie ve in the age we're in that a game would come out with graphics like this. I digress... i only played the one mode and i lost interest immediately. I just didnt get the point. 2. Story: its ok, but it jumped around too much. not bad, but didnt keep me interested. And while its cool to see famous actors faces rendered in addition to them lending their voices, it took me out of the game. I kept seeing Merle Dixon and Candyman!

And also i have gotten expired where he is shooting on my abs and he gets a headshot while im shooting on his head and dont get a headshot lmao. I watch every replay when i get expired and let me tell you 6/10 times i get expired is bologny. They need to fix that TODAY!. And also the respawning is ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!. I get 20 kill streak and all of a sudden somebody respawns right next to me and takes me out. On top of all that, these perks dont keep you safe from the radar at all. Like i said im on my 3rd prestige and ive unlocked EVERYTHING. I hope treyarch fixes the respawns and bullet hits otherwise people will stop buying the game. Maybe even not prestige like they did not in modern warefare 3. Right now all my friends did not prestige because of this bogus and everyone is hoping that treyarch will soon fix these problems.

"I was excited to get this game since I have enjoyed every other COD game. But Treyarch absolutely ruined this game. The multiplayer experience ruins everything. The server is constantly going down and booting you from games. Then it won't let you join back. I know their servers may be having issues with the amount of people playing, but come on, this is not their first time around the block. They should have done a better job predicting what the server load would be. When the servers are working, the connection is terrible. Whoever is the host has the best connection and is untouchable. You put 10 bullets into his body and he turns around and shoots once and kills you. The spawns also completely jacked up. You are constantly getting shot in the back no matter where you are in the map. Someone will kill you and you will respawn either right behind them or right in front of them, just to get killed all over again. The graphics are worse than MW3, and they have more of a cartoonish feel about them. Not nearly as realistic either. I already know about a dozen people who have returned the game for Halo 4. Unless Treyarch comes out with some radical patches to the system, it is a complete waste of time and money, and will only frustrate you to no end.",2,17,16,233,1009,18,322,17,6,76.01,6.06,7.5,8.57

Multiplayer is worse than MW3, lag and bullet recognition is TERRIBLE. If your not running at least a four bar, you will not win. The only good things about this are the campaign and zombies. CoD will always be the same, there's no room for innovation. I'm strongly considering going to Halo 4... I've never played Halo. Don't waste your money.

"Been an avid FPS for over a decade. Started with Delta Force and Joint Ops on PC. Anyway, I own all the COD games as well as the Battlefield games. This will be my last COD purchase. After so many issues in the past, you'd think they would fix them in new games right? Like the spawn issues in multiplayer. How can you spawn someone in front of multiple bad guys and don't even give spawn protection for a few seconds? Why does it sometimes take 2 shots from a snipers rifle to kill, but a single shotgun blast from 2 blacks away always kills? Why, oh why did you get rid of Vote Kicking players? Now a single person can ruin game after game cause they are young, dumb, racists, immature, whatever and the only option is for me to leave. If the server is sick of they idiot, why not be able to boot them? Same goes for rage quitters. If someone quits during a match and they are the host (you never know who is hosting BTW), everything freezes while it sets up another host. Ok, np. But many times there is an issue so if kicks everyone out and you lose the points you'd worked on. They got lazy with this one, one crate you can climb, but the SAME crate in a different area, you can't. And it happens a lot. It can be fun, but very frustrating. It feels rushed and unfinished. My biggest issues is the small maps which only helps make bad spawn creations worse",2,0,5,267,1059,15,344,20,4,84.29,4.82,5.3,7.59
"I only play multiplayer online and Black Ops 2 took some getting used too. Graphics look a bit cheesy and there is a big difference in the amount of hit markers you need in order to get kills on this game. You probably need about 5-10 hit markers to kill someone on the other team. The assault rifles are not as effective. SMG's are probably the best guns on this game. Learn the maps quick and expect to play against people who still camp and use shotguns because of their lack of skills. One last good thing though is that you can add 3 attachments to weapons and their are some new kill streaks.",3,2,7,116,476,6,148,7,7,82.08,5.93,6.54,8.7

"This game was all in all one of my favorite cods yet, it still doesnt beat cod4 in my opinion. The game itself isnt bad the main problem with the game is the players. In multiplayer the main problem is the people who feel the need to camp corners and stay in the same spot all game. The lag is a small problem but it is nothing new in my opinion. Zombies was a tad bit of a let down but overall fun, tranzit however is only playable with three or four people. I have yet to play the campaign but in have yet to finish a campaign in any of the cods, its not really my cup of tea. Now ill get into the main problem with the game, the players. This is nothing new to the cod franchise, so i dont really understand why people feel the need to complain about that. The people have ruined every cod since cod4 where it was the people with red dot m16s, then in world at war it was every single person who felt the need to use the mp40, in mw2 it was everyperson who camped with noob tubes, and acr, or an ump45, black op 1 had the people who used the aug and famas which were crazy over powered, and finally in mw3 it was the pp90m01 or whatever it was and mp7 that killed that game. So the people who play the game in that way is nothing new and it will always be there because people feel good about being pro online players. Dont judge the game on the way the people play it, the game in and of itself is great its just the people in the game have to ruin it by being jerks.",4,4,10,300,1149,13,380,11,11,71.99,9.99,5.64,12.64

But I think people exaggerate it, because I don't lag very much. The multiplayer has the potential to be the best in the cod series, all it needs is a lag patch. I'm not a big fan of the zombies in this game... Tranzit is really stupid because it's 3 tiny maps connected by long foggy trails, and if you miss the bus, you're forced to go through it, which is suicide.

"I should have known better. I was never a fan of black ops 1 but I really, really wanted to like this game. The best part about the whole game to me is the sound, other than that its horrible compared to MW3. The commercials were awesome, I mean come on, iron man was in a freaking jet for crying out loud!! But like I said, I really should have known better. The weapons just don't seem solid. There isn't a single gun in the first 15 levels that are decent enough to use online, and the servers or lack there of, are just horrible. Every time your playing there's a host migration. It takes a whole clip to kill someone and the graphics are really second rate. If they only made the engine a bit more robust, it be a great game to play but I can't say that it is. I waited for the midnight release, played it for 4 hours and sold it the next day to someone at work for $50 bucks. The MW series is the best from COD. Black ops is just horrible, and zombies isn't all that fun either. It could be so much better... When is MW4 coming out cause this game is not worth $10. I would really like to meet the game reviewers who gave this game 9/10 in reviews and said it was the best game in the COD series, and ask them how much money treyarch gave them to butter them up.

I've played every COD since 4, I've played pro tournament's through Gamebattles and just about any other competitive gaming website, never has one of these games made me want to never play COD again. Basically I've switched to Halo, which is an epic game btw. The lag compensation in BO2 multiplayer is atrocious, it kills the game, nearly impossible let to play. The hit detection is designed for all the little 10 year olds who have taken over an 18+ rated game, basically so all these garbage players out there who can't aim can feel like they're good while those of us who can actually aim are trying to figure out how the guy who isn't even looking at me just shot me! The campaign is just rediulous. Just pop in the first black ops and pick up from there. Took me 4 hours to beat the campaign.

"Some will say that it sucks because it is the same game being recycled every year, with the same run and gun gameplay, and there is truth to that. However, I actually enjoy the COD type of gameplay, however, this game just sucks for many other reasons. It is the only COD since COD4 that I absolutely hate. I love the COD franchise, and am a avid player. However, Black Ops 2 left me very disappointed. I was beyond hyped and excited to play this all winter long, but I hate to admit the game is really a step in the wrong direction. The guns sound like plastic toys, and the graphics look very cartoonist and are a step backwards...again. The servers are terrible right now, but that should change over time. About 40% of the games 'Lose connection to Host' because people keep rage quitting (not to mention the fairly common 'servers are currently down' message...but again this should change hopefully for those who decide to keep the game). Overall the graphics are bad, and lack the 'crisp' look of such titles as Modern Warfare 2. Even the first Black Ops looked better (in my humble opinion). Zombies, quite possibly what I was excited about the most is SUCH a BIG letdown! They tried to make it better....and I salute them for it but seriously they totally ruined it with what they did. I really hope that this is not the direction the game is headed, or the future will indeed be black for the franchise. Also if you do decide to get it, which I recommend you save your hard earned money, they want you to pay an extra $50-60 for bonus maps. P.S.

"Against ever instinct in my body I bought Black Ops II on its release date. I typically like the production company that creates the Modern Warfare games, but Black Ops has its little niche in the market with Combat Training. So let me first start by saying if you are a hardcore, online rank player, this review is not for you. Although Black Ops II has come leaps and bounds with its own online services, the true rank battles will and still remain in the MMW series. Having said that, BOII is great for the recreational gamer looking to get a taste for online, but still not looking to get lit up the second they spawn by someone who eats, drinks and breathes COD online matches. Which brings me to Combat training.... Combat training was introduced in BOI, allowing an invidual or a party to fight against, or alongside bots online. The greatness of being able to deploy a killstreak (now scorestreaks) in a match without the frustration of ranked players pummeling you, made Black Ops very appealing to the recreational gamer. However, if you found this gaming exciting, the lack of game modes, challenges, etc became very apparent in BOI. Increase the difficult and the AI was not 'smarter' just cheap (aka shooting at you before they even see you, or your bullets do little to no damage). The killstreaks were easy to get, but the AI would go Rambo once a care package hit the map. If dominating a map, sometimes the max care packages were only 3 per match (3 for each life, so if you're too good to die....) Little things that made BOI Combat Training pretty stale after awhile. Introduce BOII Combat training. It's like they went into every recreational gamers mind and improved the gameplay. Now all game modes are available on Combat Training, plus a non-party online option which is great for unranked matches. Killstreaks (scorestreaks) are infinitie as they have moved to the Modern Warfare point system. The care packages are now instantaneous, meaning your sentry gun is no longer going to be stolen by the fore-mentioned 'Rambo' bots. The maps are fun and nuketown returns. The AI is more intelligent, but not frustrating. Overall a great experience. There are only a few minor annoyances, (bots can't climb fhrough windows without awkward movements) etc. The gun fire rate and accuracy has been improved, but still not as smoothe as MW3. The player perks require limited space, so you have to compromise your online advantages here and there. The campaign is a lot better than the 'what the heck is going on' plot of BO!, and yes, zombies have returned. All in all, worth the $60 spot, but careful if you are a hardcore gamer.... but you all ready know that if you are.",5,12,16,476,2130,44,694,28,9,66.23,8.24,8.77,10.5

In terms of the continuing multiplayer franchise, Black Ops II is the most balanced online multiplayer to date, with good maps, a variety of gametypes and a balanced weapon sandbox. Key playlists are always populated. Perks are not as overpowering as in previous Call of Duty titles. The weapon balance is very good, with very few weapons that are considered overpowered. Proper balance changes have been implemented to correct weapon issues. The DLC released so far has been well executed, with maps that both play well and look stunning.

It does not play well on the Switch Lite because you cannot see everything and you will miss enemies and the poison looks exactly like the grass and it's difficult to see the text. I bought it to play on the Switch Lite and it was a frustrating experience. I also have the original Switch so I tried it on the TV and the graphics are terrible and hard on the eyes and then I tried it in handheld mode and it was amazing and the graphics are so much better but like I said before, I bought it to play not the Switch Lite so I'm only giving it 3 stars.

Things don't start getting interesting until chapter 10. Also there's a lot of dialogue! So you'll be pressing that A/B button a whole lot. If this is your first digimon game I would suggest doing some research when it comes to digivolving your fave digimon to a mega, how to train their needed stats, getting money and exp.

The game costs 50 dollars at Best Buy. I'm a little over half way through this game at about 15 hours and really enjoying it. The battle system is very good. The graphics are good and the audio is good as well. The only thing that is off is the voice acting... it is bad. But I,m getting used to it. There is an option for Japanese vocals with English subtitles. I recommend this to any RPG fan.",5,2,0,120,458,10,164,12,2,81.07,4.44,3.68,7.33
"*spoilers ahead* This game has many positives. Nice visual upgrades. All the three dimensional settings are very accurate per memory of the original SFC game and emulations/repros played. There is actual jumping over terrain and jumping down from ledges. Now with 12 save slots instead of the original 3 slots. This version has actual Treasure Chest discovery/hunting. Back up inventory management is improved. Leveling seems to be easier in this remade version for faster playthroughs. The tiered seeds and seed growing system is improved making it useful and advantageous to use it frequently earlier on. Improved variety and accessibility of accessory equipment. The addition of Lilcactus has actual rewards, not just a poem happy sprite like in another old Mana remake. This version does have a handholding method via golden stars depicting the modern go here next which is welcome considering how obscure the original seiken densetsu 3 was on who how what and where for story progression, even with an English translation. It is nice to have optional dialogue with secondary characters while in town limits. And the elemental names are Sylphid and Salamando again... small yay. Also on the positive side, the vibration feature can be turned off. On the fence as to whether I like the new enemy loot drop system versus the old random treasure carousel method; the booby traps and chance at mimics based on Luck stat was part of the appeal. On the fence about post game chapter and new ascended job classes, but the unlockable new game plus is kind of neat. On the fence about the option to reset job classes; that was part of the replay value originally. And now the bad... Actual load times are a minor inconvenience. Changing back and forth from day to night is reminiscent of what a horrible night for a curse. The colored jars added for various recovery types may be a bit too much handholding. The ring menu doesnt seem as effective as it once was. Takes far longer to charge class attack meter. Much of the voice acting gets old/annoying quickly; remember reading dialogue in role playing games... or does anyone remember reading at all anymore? However, all added cinematic scenes and dialogue are skippable, both an advantage and a disadvantage. An advantage if repeating a scene or just trying to avoid listening to the nails on a chalkboard that a few characters have for voices *cough* Charlotte, Niccolo, vampire guy. A huge disadvantage if you bump a button by accident. Also, the game settings allow for voice sound level to be adjusted independently from music and sound effects to compensate. Not too thrilled about the repeatable error that closed my game each time I finished off the Black Rabite. I genuinely recommend this Trials of Mana remake to other players. Overall, this is a great remake, too bad this team didnt work on another remake released this year of a 1997 classic game.",5,1,0,495,2358,88,804,34,9,54.65,9.25,10.18,12.93
"I love the way this game combines old school writing and overall pacing and play with updated graphics. I really wish FF7 would have taken this general approach. Just a face lift to the graphics folks, not a completely new game. They struck a nice balance here making the game fun, looks great, good customization to keep things different and interesting.

"First, if you've played and loved these games, this is a great package. If you've never played them and have just played newer Assassin's Creed titles, they'll feel just a bit antiquated. Nothing is new to the games, but the throwaway multiplayer from Revelations have been removed. Now, regarding the visuals, these games are barely remasters. Rather, they're virtually the same as their last generation iterations with improved resolution (they run in 1080p), and improved textures. Draw distances might also be improved a bit, but not enough to cover up pop-in objects at the new resolution. The game also, for whatever reason, runs at a disappointing 30fps rather than an improved 60fps. Ultimately these games feel like a slightly sharper way to play the same titles from PS3 and 360 rather than a detailed remaster. But they were great fun 5-7 years ago, and they're just as fun today.",4,2,0,157,712,18,229,9,9,65.73,8.42,9.17,11.56

It is also a bit strange to see some of the characters with very weird looking faces. Also, and this may just me, it feels like the controls didn't transfer well to the PS4.

"A fairly good graphical update of the PS3 versions, with a few noticeable glitches early on in AC2 that seemed to level out as the game progressed (in particular, if a speaking character was standing in front of a light source the light would shine through their face). Otherwise it's solid. The game still has all the fun control problems you're used to on these old AC games (No, I do not want to jump backwards. Jump right!), but that's to be expected. If you already own the old PS3 versions I'm not sure there's a compelling reason to upgrade, unless you just prefer a PS4 controller or want to condense your bookcase and unload three games to replace with one.

I could have done the same 'smoothing' that they did in about 20 minutes with Final Cut. The graphics are actually worse than the original. Especially in the cut scenes. Dear Lord the cutscenes are hideous. If you don't believe me, ask a friend to borrow their PS3 and buy AC2 for $0,50 online then play them side by side. I was left very unhappy.

"Here's my point: you can buy crafting/experience/other boosters for your character; you can temporarily advance faster with those. You can buy cosmetic items (which I have never done) like clothes or pets, none of which affect gameplay.or, you can buy extra bag slots, extra character slots, and treasure chest keys. It's also possible to unlock the full version of the game, which gives you some one-time bonuses, special items, and access to a summon skill that will soon be overshadowed. Finally, you can buy gold by exchanging your real-world investment for in-game currency. This literally allows you to buy the best equipment in the game. Now, I appreciate te idea that a free-to-play game needs a means of making money from players who have already made the initial investment; I would ask youself what is really incentive enough;I'm glad the company resisted directly selling special equipment. Or am I? I mean, there's something that undermines gameplay when anything special about your character is purchased; the most disposable income wins. However, the alternative left me hungry for some incentive to having purchased the card. That hunger was partly satisfied. I unlocked the special edition, bought an extra character slot, an extra bag slot, and that was about it ( I got one of these for the holidays as well, in case you're noting that the price doesn't match). Was it worth it? I've never usd the extra character slot--yet. Sure, I made a bunch of characters just to say I did, but I really only play 3 characters. The bag slot is great. Bags are expensive, in-game. This slot was the perfect solution for me. The extras are ok for the game, but you have to care how your character looks, how fast you level, or level your crafting. I once bought a key to one of the 30 black lion chests I had, but really, you're playing the lottery with that. In conclusion, unless you can specifically identify what is of value to you in the game that you cannot achieve by other means, you will be disappointed that you did this. Keep in mind you are getting digital items in exchange for real money. Value, in that case, is in the eye of the beholder.

"Since there are so many rave reviews of what this game has to offer by itself, Ill be focusing more so on the external package. For its price, I have to say that this physical release of the beloved indie game is a little on the costly side for what it has to offer. Plain and simple, this version basically is just a game cartridge in a case complete with a small art book instead of the usual manual you might expect from these kind of releases. However, while some might see this as a charming offer, the game is admittedly available for only $10 on most digital storefronts so the added $20-$25 is probably the most questionable part of this whole deal. While the game is amazing, its honestly up to you if you see this release as worth it for the price its at.",4,5,0,147,605,17,206,5,13,58.44,12.41,7.39,16.39
"Undertale stands out to me as the first indie game I ever went out of my way to buy. I initially bought it digitally via its original Steam release and fell in love with it to the point that I bought the Collector's Editions on PS4 and PS Vita. That would make this the 4th time I've purchased this game and have no regrets in doing so. The story isn't grand in scale, instead being a more personal tale with far reaching implications but if you're a frequent player of RPG's wherein the climax revolves around saving the universe as we know it then this is a breath of fresh air. Gameplay consists of turn-based combat like RPG's of yesteryear but the twist is that in battles you are given the option of decimating opponents like in most other games of this nature or of diffusing the situation without violence. If you choose the former, you must time your button presses to do the most damage but if you choose the latter you scroll through a small list of (often humorous) actions that will resolve the tension. When the enemy's turn comes, you're tasked with avoiding their attacks in a way that resembles old school arcade shoot-em-upsmeaning that you have to dodge every projectile that comes your way. This small twist on combat made gameplay all the more engaging. The cast of characters are easily some of the most colorful in recent yearseach having distinct personalities that you will gravitate to. This is aided by spectacular writing that never ceases to entertain. Much of the dialogue is not only witty or humorous but it also plays on your expectations in such a way that it's always one step ahead of you. As a broad example, if you decide to go through a second playthrough there are many moments in which you may decide to approach certain scenarios differently in such a way that you think you're outsmarting the game... only for you to find out that an alternate dialogue conversation plays out and (by extension) it lets you know that it expected you to think you were going to outsmart it. Brilliant. The game is admittedly a bit short, but the experience is so memorable that it never feels that way. Graphically, it doesn't look like anything that AAA developers would put out but it has a unique art style that evokes the feeling that this was a passion project that was painstakingly put together. Lastly, the music is undeniably incredible. As someone who plays a lot of RPG's I can say that this is easily the best soundtrack I've heard since Final Fantasy VII was released way back in 1997. It blends many styles together and uses many different sound fonts to great effect. The end result is music that is infectious even at its most daunting moments and emotionally resonant whenever it needs to be. Seriously, this game is worth it for the soundtrack alone. If you have the funds to buy the soundtrack CD it comes highly recommended. Overall: 10/10",5,5,1,530,2318,66,779,23,11,59.1,10.74,8.63,14.2

"This was a gift for my son. He has wanted this game for quite some time, and when it came out for Switch, I bought it for him. Gameplay is straightforward. The characters are interesting, the plot is a bit dark, but it does give you a chance to play the game as a pacifist to some extent. It is interesting to see how the choices made affect the gameplay. The quality is old fashioned (think 8 bit retro graphics), but it is still rather fun to play. The music is fantastic. Depending on the choices made throughout the game, the level of difficulty can be low or high. It is quite challenging for my children. Overall, it is a fun game and the price is right. It may be a bit scary for some children, even with a rating of everyone 10+, but my 7 year old loves it.",5,3,0,150,593,15,199,11,5,80.76,5.38,5.27,9.45

"Undertale is a good and unique game, although not without its flaws. The game play, writing and art are a weird yet mostly successful mix of comedic self-parody and earnestness. The core fighting mechanic involves controlling a little heart, dodging obstacles to avoid damage. To engage with the enemy, you can choose either to fight or to interact and talk. It's unique, fun, and the game constantly riffs on the concept. There are a handful of puzzles. They are okay but not inspired. The writing is full of jokes, meta-humor, and absurdism, and there are a cast of memorable characters. I enjoyed this side of the game a lot. I found the story mixed, though. The broad strokes of an underground realm of monsters is good, but it's overly complex and confusing, partially due to a reliance on exposition dumps, and there are about twenty endings, which rob the game of its narrative momentum about halfway through and start to grate. I wasn't very emotionally engaged. The art is very basic, largely in the spirit of self-parody, but about half of the character designs are actually really strong, and there are some pretty environments. However, the other half is pretty bad. Some of the in-world character designs are not even intelligible, and there's an absence of animation which, while joked at, seems lazy. The music is unreservedly excellent. Overall, if just due to its sheer oddity, I have to recommend playing this.",4,1,0,250,1139,38,387,17,8,60.95,8.41,8.98,11.96

You earn no experience (called love) for this and just a little bit of money. So for the pacifist ending, you will finish on level 1. The game tries to urge you along this path without ever really letting you know that if you kill a single enemy that you change the ending. The pacifist ending seems to be the preferred path the first playthrough of the game. The neutral ending means you kill some monsters and let some live/go. The path of violence is the one where you kill every monster in every fight and let none flee and you never run, this is probably the most difficult path. The game itself is bizarre and fascinating and I've only dropped it a star for the lack of explaining the finer points explained above.",4,1,0,206,878,21,289,11,9,69.14,8.27,7.68,11.57

You can also use the analogue sticks now, and I found myself switching between the d-pad and the analogue sticks depending on the situation, which was useful. Being so faithful though, means that some of the less savory bits of the original level designs are still problem points here.

"As a kid, I never really owned a Playstation, but I did play the demo of the first game and loved it and wanted to play more of it. I finally get to experience the trilogy for the first time in years! A lot of love and effort went into this remaking this trilogy. They even got voice actor Tom Kenny, (voice of SpongeBob), to reprise his role as Spyro since he voiced him in Spyro 2 & 3. The art style is beautifully recreated and very eye-catching. The music is a joy to listen to as well. Another cool feature that they added was that you can switch the music to the original soundtrack from the PS1 trilogy! That's very cool! During all 3 games, there are missions that you can complete. They are optional. When you've completed these missions, you unlock an art gallery from all 3 games. For me, I think it's cool to see some concept artwork for each game. I always enjoy seeing behind-the-scenes stuff from video games. :-) They have also added the cheat codes from the original games as well. There is one new cheat code that is only exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. It's the Rainbow Sunglasses. I don't know if the Rainbow Sunglasses will be added to the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game or not. For now, it's only exclusive to Nintendo Switch. There were some slight speed frame issues when loading up a new area, but when you enter a level everything seems to appear to running smoothly. My only gripe is that not all 3 games are on the cartridge. Only the first game is on the cartridge and you have to download Spyro 2 & 3. The PS4 and Xbox One versions also had the same issues as well. There were some levels that were challenging to complete. Specifically the levels where you are on a time limit and you have to collect items or destroy enemies to earn extra time points to the clock. You have to do this all in one go and try not to bump into anything. Or don't lose too much time. Otherwise, you'll have to do it all over again. Overall, this trilogy was a blast to play through and it's great for anyone to play!!",5,2,1,396,1592,35,537,28,5,77.76,5.93,5.75,9.19
"The team has done a very good job of porting Spyro Reignited Trilogy on Switch (Includes Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! and Spyro: Year of the Dragon.) The first game is physically on cart with the other 2 games needing a download. As far as the game goes it runs smoothly and has been remastered in HD. There are some slight speed frame issue when loading up a new area but when the level is running everything seems to appear smooth and solid frame rate. Though I wish all 3 games had been included physically it doesn't seem to be the case. PS4 and XBox owners had the same problem when it was released on those platforms. Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a nice addition to the Switch library of games.",4,1,0,134,564,12,187,8,7,71.77,7.41,7.18,10.28

"I was really looking foward to play spyro for the first time ever as most critics were really happy with this remake. However I found these three game (spyro 1, 2 and 3) to be really shallow. You just collect a bunch of dragons and pearls and keep moving to the next level. You dont actually find new skills or evolve you character like in Banjo Kazooie. Its a simple game from the nineties and good for nostalgia. If you have a nintendo switch, Mario Odissey is a much better game. Yooka Layle or Crash Bandicoot are better too. If you have a Ps4, go with Ratchet ans Clank or even the spiderman game.",2,0,1,114,476,13,165,8,6,69.92,7.05,6.67,10.26

"The game overall is okay when it comes to game play, but understand going into this game that playing it is going to afford you little reward if you are looking to build up a character or improve your equipment. You have 3 club levels (or bags) to chose from, you sacrifice accuracy for power as you go up in club level. There are no skill points earned and the course difficulty is dependent on the skill level you chose when you start a season. The joystick is very touchy and the green reads are difficult and inconsistent based on slope speed. Essentially, the only thing you play for is to change your clothes and look of your clubs (has no effect on club skill), and the money you earn is absolutely useless. If you like to just kill time with no goal in mind then this game is okay, but if you want to work towards something like improving your skills or equipment, do not buy this game. I enjoy it for what it is, but could be so much more.",3,5,0,182,749,14,242,7,11,67.95,10.24,7.26,13.48
"Rory McIlroy is way better than this game. You cant upgrade stats, you cant put spin on the ball and your luck to hit a perfect shot is one in a million. God forbid you have a slow back swing, good by ball.. and if you finally have that perfect swing you better have put it directly down the center fairway. Ive always been a fan of Tiger Woods and the last EA game Rory McIlroy but this game cannot compete. That being said the only thing I like about this game is the putting. If you would take the accuracy and power of Rory and the putting and graphics of this crappy game you would have a master piece.",1,3,0,120,478,3,156,7,6,79.46,6.44,5.9,7.86
"The game is great as far as graphics and the flow of an actual round of golf. But the putting is just ridiculously stupid. Trying to make adjustments of a shorter backswing and shorter follow thru doesnt help either. Worst putting mechanics and accuracy of any golf game I ever played. No where close to a Tiger Woods caliber of a game. If they fix the putting I would give a better rating.",3,3,0,73,312,6,104,6,5,73.96,5.97,6.9,8.15

We feel like we got ripped off. But it's the rich people so they don't care. Wish there was a fix for this, even if we had to 'pay' for it... Try and think / walk in the other person's shoes..

"The newest version of PGA golf is fairly similar to past attempts. In reality, there is only so much realism that you can get from a game controller, but this one seems to be a little bit more accurate than the EA versions.

"Hollow Knight is really a long adventure; if you like exploring huge beautiful caverns and trying to defeat enemies, within a nice soundtrack, you will love this game too. :) The graphics are unique and excellent. Hollow Knight is so much fun! :D There are so many helpful items that can be found or bought with in-game currency. Your Hollow Knight will get more effective at defeating enemies as you progress, new skills, in-game maps, and equip-able items. And if you find certain creatures you can travel to and from those locations quickly. This switch bundle comes with the 4 dlc upgrades, an interesting instruction manual, a map, and a 15% off of all Hollow Knight products promo code. Note: when you get close to perishing press the + button and select the third lowest menu item, something about saving and quitting. If you do that: all progress will be saved, you won't lose all of your Geo coins collected and have to fight your shadow to get them back, and you will start sitting on the last bench you sat on.

An excellent Metroidvania with a boatload to explore and 35+ hours of gameplay. Challenging but not punishing. One of the best soundtracks you can hear in a videogame, and that's not hyperbole (check it on YouTube if you're skeptical). I didn't expect this title to be this grest, frankly, and given its current limitation to PC and the Switch, Switch owners should be thankful they can even play this modern masterpiece. The art style may throw you off at first, but hidden beneath the cartoon graphics is a story rife with classic philosophical dilemmas about the meaning of sacrifice, life, and the price paid for knowledge.

"Having been a NFS fan since the very first one back in the 90s, I have to say I KNOW my Need For Speed games. There's been a lot of hits, and a lot of misses, which mainly depends on the studio putting out the specific game. IMHO, the last GREAT NFS was NFS: Hot Pursuit. I LOVED that game and tacked on thousands of hours playing it on PS3 (and STILL do on occasion!) The next few after it, The Run, Rivals, Payback, were ok at best, but never grabbed me like Hot Pursuit did. Until now. NFS: Heat FINALLY brings back that thrill of racing through the city with a pack of cops hot on your tail. Heat opens up a nice, big world with endless, challenging roads to explore and tear through. There's lots of shortcuts, speed traps, jumps, and it even brings in rally tracks for a nice change from the pavement. My biggest complaint with the game is that it doesn't let you play as a cop, which in Hot Pursuit could be just as much fun as running from them.

"It's a good overall game. If you like the past NFS games you should like this one. Here are the few things I don't like though. Musics selection needs work. Building a good off road vehicle seems confusing. I buy upgraded off road parts but the vehicles ranking drops. My biggest complaint is the drift scoring. I can take my car build for racing and drift perfect corners and get very low scores. Get in my car built with 'drift' parts that I can barely control, crash into walls and barriers and score so many points I've beat the event before the 1st of 3 laps is done.

"Breath of the Wild is already an incredible game, the DLC pack adds more content and gives you an incentive to come back again and again. The first part of the DLC pack puts you back into Hyrule to go on a scavenger hunt of sorts, looking for some extra pieces of gear. DO NOT look up the locations of the gear on the internet, it's a lot more fun when you have to figure it out on your own. The first DLC pack also includes the master trials. Don't let similar trials from previous Zelda games fool you, these trials are HARD. You can easily get 5+ hours out of them even if you beat them first try . . . And if you're that good at the game, the DLC also adds the brutal Master Mode. Master Mode is more than just making the enemies harder, harder enemies appear earlier in the game and in more difficult locations. A task that was easy the first time through suddenly requires you to sneak your way around a brutally difficult Lynel. It's a total blast and I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the base game!",5,7,0,200,797,20,272,12,6,74.86,6.96,5.86,10.67

Really really really spectacular game.",5,2,0,65,269,11,98,5,5,66.09,7.27,6.26,11.97
"Dragon Quest XI must be played by anyone who loves traditional turn-based JRPGs. And since it is traditional, it's also a good game for people who want to dive into the genre for the first time. Like Final Fantasy games, you don't need to know anything about the previous titles in the franchise because the stories are for the most part disconnected. If you're deciding between the Switch version and the PS4 version, the Switch is the way to go. The ability to speed up battles, call your horse anywhere on the field, and craft items anywhere besides just a save point saves you so much time playing the game. You also get the new 2D-mode if you prefer a retro-styled playthrough, orchestrated versions of in-game music, more story content, and more. This game will last you over 100 hours if you're also looking for a good beefy game to sink into. The visuals are well-preserved in this game as well. I definitely recommend this to anyone!",5,2,0,176,750,15,247,9,9,68.26,8.6,7.74,11.23

"I just finished the game and I'm mad at myself for sleeping on it for so long. The music is incredible, the gameplay is some of the most fun I've ever experienced, and the characters are great! There's so much to do and the world never feels empty. This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. If there's anything you should know, though, it's that you should put aside 60-100 hours if you want to finish the game. When you finish the game, there's actually a whole post game story that is around 40 extra hours or so. It is so worth it to play that much. I will admit that the first hour or so is a little boring and bland, but once you leave the village, that's when it gets exciting. That's what hooked me. If there's one thing I don't like, it's the main character. He never speaks and he always has this stoic look on his face. Emotionless... You could tell him that his dad died, everyone in the party would freak out, but he would just be standing there looking like nothing happened. That's my only complaint. By far, everything this game does right outweighs this one complaint. I had so much fun and I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Just don't forget to beat the post game true boss. Definitely worth it.",5,1,0,245,952,15,317,18,4,83.56,4.99,4.87,7.89
"This game took me just under 100 hours to complete. In that time I rarely found myself farming or doing anything truly repetitive. The story beats kept me going at such a wonderful pace. After 50 hours I figured they were going to start stretching the story, but no, it was fresh and wonderful throughout. The combat did get old after a while, but if you enjoy classic turn based combat RPGs you know what to expect. Visually the game is one of the best on the system. The music is also very good, but DOES end up getting old after 60 hours. I would say a must have for RPG fans, but 100 hours is a HUGE commitment. I would say, if you have the time it is truly worth playing.",5,1,0,132,530,8,176,9,5,79.15,5.86,5.79,8.29
"Dragon Quest 11 is the first mainline Dragon Quest game to hit a home console since Dragon Quest 8 in 2004. While Dragon Quest 9 on the DS was a lot of fun, it didn't have a set cast of characters and as a result it's story wasn't as complex or emotionally resonant. Dragon Quest 11 is a return to the style of the classic games with a fixed cast of characters, all of which get meaningful development over the course of the game. The combat system isn't revolutionary but all the attacks are wonderfully animated, especially the multi-character team attacks. The amount of game is also astounding, featuring several distinct acts, each with major plot and character progression. If anything there's almost too much game. The Switch version is also the definitive version of the game for the addition of new content and replacing the lack luster MIDI music of other versions of the game with mostly live orchestrations. If your a fan of RPGs and own a Switch you should definitely give Dragon Quest 11 a shot. If your unsure you can always try out the free and lengthy demo available on the Nintendo eShop.",5,1,0,203,890,26,306,9,11,56.42,10.99,8.67,14.15

I highly recommend this masterpiece",5,1,0,75,301,8,101,5,5,77.68,6.15,5.83,10.27
"Only 10 hours in but this is a gem. The characters, music and voice acting are great. The story keeps things moving along and the battle system is nice that you can set it to only control the main PC.

"I purchased this on release for the PS4 as well. I played that version and while its a bit crisper I felt like the camera rotation was hard to get dialed in on the PS4 and it made me a bit dizzy to play it. On top of that I can't take my PS4 with me. Enter the Switch version. I decided to give this another try on the Switch since I love DQ games and I felt like my experience on the PS4 was not so much the game as it was the hardware. Sure enough I tuned the camera rotation on the switch to make it faster and it felt just right. Add to this the portability of the Switch and I have not made it through the whole game satisfactorily. This game has some extra feature too since it is the definitive edition. The big plus over the PS4 is the upgraded audio. Instead of crappy midi on PS4 you get full symphony tracks. HUGE UPGRADE. I was unable to play and enjoy this game on the PS4, but the Switch version fixed all of my issues and its a better version of the game at the same time. If you have the option for both, but this one. You won't regret it.",5,1,0,218,822,15,281,14,5,81.98,5.69,4.47,8.98

Let me tell you they are correct, the orchestra music alone is incredible, but with all the extra character play through ( wont spoil it here) and the 2d mode , it was worth double dipping to play this remarkable game once again.",5,1,0,70,319,9,102,3,12,59.88,10.7,9.73,14.48
"Dragon Quest XI is a very traditional Dragon Quest game. Making fewer changes between entries than the average Final Fantasy, the series has certainly grown into modern consoles while respecting its NES roots. If you're new to Dragon Quest, it's one of the original Japanese RPGs with art by Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball Z). It plays exactly as you'd expect a classic JRPG to play. This is a port of the original PS4/3DS release, and it's kind of the best of both worlds. The graphics are downgraded (but hold up surprisingly well) on the Switchlight maps and textures are of a lower resolution, LoD settings have been tuned way down, and even world and character geometry has been simplified in comparison to the PS4 version. But this version has the additional 2D, '16-bit' mode, which is basically a whole new game with crossover points and the same story as the 3D mode. It's a solid port of an exceptional entry in one of the best and most important video game series ever. Probably worth getting.",5,1,0,182,798,27,277,9,10,57.55,10.26,8.52,14.02

I don't take the Switch off the tv dock much but its nice to have that option when someone else in the family is hogging the tv. The game itself is fantastic, core Dragon Quest experiences... so glad we get most everything DQ related in the West nowadays.

"I traded in the ps4 edition for this and I'm not disappointed. I'm getting a whole new 2d game and more store. On thing the ps4 version had that this one does not is targets. In the ps4 dq11, there were about 5 targets scattered across each region and you had to hunt them down. The switch version does not have them, which is actually a relief. The 2d game and 3d game are separate but with items carrying over and you can jump backwards into chapters to find things or replay story. You switch at the save points. One downside is that if you play 5 chapters of 3d and go backwards to ch 1 2d, you cannot jump forwards again to the newer chapter in 3d. You have to start at an equal place in the story to the older 2d chapter you're in. I'm very pleased with my purchase, and I highly recommend dqx1",5,1,0,161,627,7,210,10,5,80.15,6.08,5.26,8.18

I played the Demo and now the Physical game and can say being able to load the Demo save and continue is great. Gameplay is also intuitive once you learn them and doesn't require alot of memorization to get into the game. So for a 2019 game is a must have. Only issue is if you go portable with a graphics intensive game it will take a toll on the battery.

It could easily be tweaked to become more enjoyable, but EA definitely relies heavily on microtransactions in all of their titles now, so I don't see it happening. It just takes a ridiculously long time to start earning any type of good move sets or fighters...unless you pay EA more money. Definitely a 'buy when on-sale' kind of game.

"EA stepped up their game again for this one. The controls have changed a bit from the last titles but once you get the hang of it the striking is really cool and complex. In this game the angles matter more than the type of strike being thrown, and a fight can easily be ended by walking or leaning into a big strike. The graphics are good and gameplay is smooth and feels realistic (you cant just spam flying knees and expect your fighter not to tire).

"The gameplay has become increasingly more of an arcade style and the series is in danger of losing all resemblance of a true simulation sports experience. The online team play, which features 12 users playing 6 vs 6 at locked positions for their respective team, has turned into a tilted affair that very much favors offensive players, or more specifically, forwards. This leaves true defenseman and goalies that have long been dedicated to their craft wondering why they bother to play this game. Perhaps EA should just through in the towel and make this a strictly 3 vs 3 game. They could also re-invent the big head feature while their at it. Great job ruining the online team game by cowing to the complaints of non-skilled forwards who cry incessantly about how difficult it is to score.

"It's not often a game gets released these days that doesn't in at least some way copy previous formulas, but the Gravity Rush series absolutely qualifies as an original. The original was an underappreciated classic on the PS Vita (available on PS4, but difficult to find and lacking the touch screen features of the Vita), and the sequel is just as fun a trip. The mechanics of the game revolve around your character being able to alter the direction of gravity in a fully 3-D environment. The effects are temporary, but can be improved upon as you level up.

"Tekken 7 truly is a hallmark, a fighting game crafted with obvious affection. It strikes a fine balance between accessibility to series newcomers and retaining much of its technical traditions. The soundtrack is an electronic treat, and while the story can at times seem a bit cliche, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously lets it bring in a tremendous amount of flexible character customization. Its dedication to the details helps push it into the position of one of my favorite fighting games.",4,2,0,85,417,16,143,4,13,42.94,12.55,11.65,16.03
"There seems to be TONS of content here, and the characters are very very very diverse, but at the moment I'm all but betrothed to 'Dragon Ball Fighterz', and in comparison this is lacking a little bit of 'umph', and it lacks the kind of fluidic cinema-like action that the DOA series -- despite it's ridiculousness and exploitativeness -- actually has a really great handle on. Tekken has always felt 'slower' and seems like it's more technical, but it also has wacky characters like a half-cheetah and a panda bear and a samurai-ninja robot. There's tons and tons of cosmetic add-ons and so far they all seem like they're actually earnable -- unlike the DOA moneypit or the Street Fighter faux variety -- but again, that stuff's just all about more kookiness. ... and I don't really get why those things are seen as like a revenue stream. This takes that microtransaction approach, but without the microtransaction option of buying your way out of earning all the in-game currency needed to get all the items. It's kinda neat, but it's also this thing that I don't really understand in general. As a very very casual game-player, I get the rewarding nature of unlocking things, but it also means that there's a required investment. It means that by buying the thing, you don't get the whole thing. If I wanna hang out with friends and dress up a pandabear like a super soldier and fight robot ninja in a wedding gown ... I'd have to pre-invest days or weeks of effort, just to have a silly and memorable game night experience. If you buy legos, you don't have to build an airplane to unlock the ability to make a spaceship ... so I just don't get it. Buying more characters and getting more customizations with those more characters, that makes sense to me, that's like buying more lego sets, that's like buying new boardgames. But buying hats and getting no new moves or characters or anything ... what are you buying? Playing the game for hours or days is basically spending money. It's effort, it's time that could be spent doing other things. I dunno, I feel like you'd wanna make something fun, put everything into it, unlocked, and if you want to make achievements or goals or fancy titles or make it so that complicated moves or combos or special attacks get unlocked, you're trading effort and skill for earned skills, it's an actual progression. If this had everything it has, all unlocked, this would be so fun and wacky and it'd be great for a game night. It'd be fun and memorable to try everything out, and it'd make me wanna keep investing in other things the team / company puts out. It's an inherently multiplayer experience, so I just don't get this contrived limitation. Am I really supposed to invest 72 full hours as a panda bear punching ninja demons just so I can dress up as a panda bear in a wedding dress and continue to go back and continue punching the same ninja demons i was just punching for the last 72 hours? How many days or weeks of my life is it going to take to carve out 72 hours? And what about the other 20 characters? Do I get all their stuff too, or do I have to do this for each character? If everyone has the same cowboy hat, how come I have to pay the fake 'game money' to unlock the same cowboy hat for every character? What's up with that???",3,3,1,625,2571,62,885,28,10,64.39,9.82,7.06,12.9

"I had hoped this would be something like the games of old, but there is so much about it that is very disappointing. There is no clip showing what unfolds when you beat the game (old school like) with a given character. There are only 5 lvls to the versus mode and to play online you have to have PS plus. There really isn't much replay value...and a lot of the game's main characters were left out of the game. Then there is the rip off found in every next-gen game....DLC. I remember the times when you bought a game and you got the whole game not just 50% of it and had to dish out more money for the other half by way of DLCs....Gamers out there....YOU MAKE THIS PRACTICE OK BY SUPPORTING IT (read buying the DLCs). Anyway, I don't have PS plus, having that may add some value to this game, but I wouldn't recommend it and I used to be a hardcore fan since Tekken 2...the graphics have come a long way...the gameplay not so much.",3,1,0,191,712,10,238,13,4,86.5,4.84,4.1,7.97

"I won't go into detail on Tekken 7 as it is a Tekken game. Like it or hate it is subjective. The only thing I want to point out is the new Rage Art system. IT'S JUNK! This new feature has no game-play elements what-so-ever. It's only for show. You can't fake it to trick your opponent, nor can you cancel out of it. You only use it near death in hopes that it can save you, which sounds OK on paper but the execution is anything but.

"I love that I can have a nice collection of classic Sega genesis games for Nintendo Switch, a console I can play on the go or at home on my TV. However, the emulation on this collection is horrible. There is very bad latency between button presses on the controller and action on screen. We are talking about Sega games here, they are usually fast paced and require accurate timing to when you press the button, but on the Switch it's nearly impossible to play most of these games because of the delayed action of button presses. Press jump in sonic, takes half a second for games to detect you pressed the button. Did many tests, it's not a connection between the Switch and TV being delayed, it happens in handheld mode as well. Test various controllers from Joy-Con, pro controllers both 1st and 3rd party, and Gamecube controllers. The delay is present in all of them. Maybe it is my Switch, tested it in other Switch consoles, nope, not a problem with my Switch, same issue on other systems. Giving a two start because it's a great collection of amazing games, otherwise I would 1 start it. Also Best Buy please credit my 25 points for this review. I never receive points, I've written 10+ reviews over the past year, still yet to see my reward point balance change once from writing these.",2,5,0,239,1028,22,342,12,9,65.56,9.06,8.01,11.65
"This is the third Genesis compilation in as many console generations, so it's a real shame to see extras and controller guides that were included in previous versions removed and replaced with an unnecessary interactive menu screen. Old men like me remember when Phantasy Star II was packaged with a comprehensive hint book, so omitting any kind of game or controller guide seems simply lazy. Good luck divining the technique system in PSIII without online help! Thankfully, button functions are made clear in the options menu for most games, and the better games in this collection don't require consulting a manual. The deletion of unlockables, like original arcade games, is just plain baffling. The previous edition contained an unlockables Space Harrier arcade game, which is far, far superior to the Genesis Space Harrier II. Given that Sega supposedly now owns the rights to the Technosoft developed games, the exclusion of Herzog Zwei and any of the Thunderforce titles is another disappointment. But, all faults aside, you definitely get $30 worth of Sega classics on this collection, so it's definitely a must-buy for Switch owners. Just let future anthology developers know that Noone wants to ever see the Genesis versions of Galaxy Force II or Super Thunder Blade again.",4,5,0,212,1050,43,357,9,14,40.46,13.47,12.07,17.54
"Before you scroll past this ignoring it because the title sounded absurd to you since there are many, very good games on here like Sonic, Gunstar Heroes and so on, let me start out by saying as of version 1.0.2 there's a sizeable controller lag, joycons attached or not, pro controller, it doesn't matter. There's a good half second delay from press to action. It felt less noticeable in Shinobi 3 but it was very harsh in Sonic 2. Just to drive this in, I'm not nitpicking this isn't the controller delay you might see someone complain about from using a wireless controller, the lag is genuinely a 1/2 second from press to action. Making the RPGs the only viable games to play here. Because it's not gonna help in the platformers or the Columns. I have the PC version as well and I don't recall anything like this. So much for getting these games on the go right? :\ Arg It's annoying to have to write this review because, this should be such an easy thing. There's been so many ports of these games over the years from the PS2, PSP, Wii, PS3/XB360 etc but the Switch version at the very least? The lag ruins it. The collection has been out a while too and I'm not sure this is getting fixed. Other negatives are, the emulation isn't 100% if you're a snob for that kinda thing. Some sounds are just off sounding. Hitting a sign post in Sonic 1/2 is weird sounding, as is the 1up in Shinobi 3. It's missing Sonic 3 & Knuckles as well, a very, very notable omission given how it's in many other ports. As for the games, I mean there's a lot of great games here. Sonic 1 & 2 are great, as are the Streets of Rage titles (even lets you play the japanese version of 3!), Phantasy Star 4, Shining Force 2 and so on. Just agh, the controller lag seriously ruins this port. As I said it's been out a while so I don't think they're gonna patch this out.",3,4,0,371,1424,25,496,23,5,77.36,6.48,4.93,9.15

"First off, the selection of games in this collection is excellent. There are always a few titles that get snubbed in compilations like this, but what's here is great and serves as a solid representation of the Genesis library. If that's all you're after, you're set. Buy it and enjoy it. On the other hand, if you're looking for more than just old games running on an emulator, then there's not a lot here for you. Other similar compilations, such as Capcom's Mega Man Legacy Collections or SNK's Anniversary Collection, include extra material or play options that help present their games in a fuller context. These extras are pretty sparse in this release. Some of these games have alternate arcade versions that aren't included here and there aren't any concept art/promo material galleries or anything along those lines. Other than save states, there aren't any extra gameplay options, either. You can tweak the presentation, and there's a rudimentary achievement/challenge system, but that's it. If it sounds like I'm being harsh, it's only because these collections of games can be incredible when a little extra effort is put into them. Don't get me wrong, the selection of games here is huge and awesome and I'd still recommend it to most people. It's just a little disappointing that we're missing out on some of the other content that we've come to expect from these types of re-releases.",4,1,0,258,1115,30,386,13,9,60.12,9.8,8.12,12.59
"$30 for 50 retro games is a steal. They're not all mega hits from the past, but all my Segafavorites from childhood are here and a good number of games I've never play as well. I'm having a blast playing with my kids. All the games I've played play spectacularly and look great. Sega added some nice touches, like the menu presentation looking like your expect a kid's room in the 90s to look, complete with actual slotting in the cartridges to a Sega Genesis to start each game. Theyve also included options to emulate the visuals (and issues) of a CRT TV for those that want to go full on retro.

I learned there were 2 versions of that game made, which was the main reason I bought this, and it didn't have the one I grew up playing. I wish it stated what format it had included, and it would have saved me time and money. I also didn't find the main menu user friendly. I ended up just fighting it far too much and the pixelation hurt my eyes. The Wii and original versions of these games were not all at this resolution. I would give it a break if it was an issue with converting it to a modern system, but Wii is fairly modern, and the games don't look this bad on that platform.

I know the popular tournaments are in this style but could a developer break the chains and send us into another dimension, into the future?

"I have bought almost every Need for Speed game over the years dating back to High Stakes on PS1 and this entry was good but a little disappointing to be honest. I will start off with the good things. It gorgeous, as expected. Need for Speed games always look really pretty especially since they switched to the Frostbite engine. The world is also quite sizable. It definitely feels like the largest to date. There is also a rather large selection of cars even excluding the DLC cars which is good for those who don't want to spend the extra cash. The derelict cars are a pretty cool idea, although I wish there were more. The engine sounds are pretty good once the cars are upgraded. Pretty realistic and they are recognizable. The idea of cosmetic Super Builds once a car reaches a certain level is a great idea, really making the car look the part. They also have way more custom parts for super cars than previous games which is cool if you want to make it feel like your own. General handling, especially for race and drift cars is excellent and fun with a great sense of speed. Live tuning is also a great idea. NOS is also not as important to gameplay as other NFS games which I think is a good thing but it's still there if you need that little extra bit to get past a competitor on the last stretch. Now for the things I don't care for. The music selection sucks. Even if rap/hip-hop is your genre of choice there are far too few songs. If I had to guess I would say there are only 1.5-2 hours of music that play during regular driving. This gets old quick, especially if you sit down and play for 3-4 hours. That means you heard every song twice in one sitting. In previous games it let you turn individual songs on and off which would have helped. I really wish more games let you feed in your own music either from Spotify or locally. I could play it over the top of the game but it's really hard to balance the sound effects and music that way and that means the music plays during cut scenes. Anyway, moving on from music, the other biggest complaint I have with the game is how much upgrading costs. You can easily dump $100k into a car between every event in order to stay ahead of the curve but you only get about $25k from any given event which means you are always strapped for cash. This gets worse the further you get in the game, the exact opposite of how it should be. By the last story event you should be able to buy whatever car and upgrade you want without having to budget everything. You upgrade with speed cards at shops which are random so some times they don't even carry the part you need. I get the random perk and level from cards you win but shops should have a more consistent stock. Especially if I'm spending that much money. While this game has a pretty good selection of events, race, drag, drift, off road, and runner, some of the events, especially near the end of the game, require you to do stupid things with a car that it wasn't built for. Taking a drag car on a twisty highway or a runner car for long sections of off road. This leads to real frustration when the car refuses to behave because it wasn't built for it. And you can't cheat the system by using another class of car on those select events because you can only enter cars in their respective class events. Being able to live tune is really cool and useful except they don't let you do while you are participating in an event which kind of defeats the purpose. If you tweaked your car incorrectly before the event you have to quit the event, tune it, and then restart the event. Super annoying. The story is okay but the characters are very one dimensional and unnatural even resorting to catch phrases. I also wish there were more cinematic events in the game. The highway car heist that was played at E3 2017 was the best event in the game. I was hoping for a whole game of ridiculous Fast and Furious type heists and action, but alas, it was not so. It's much more normal than that. I think that could have really made it stand out in the genre. NFS The Run is still one of my favorite NFS games just because of how well they were able to blend racing with cinematic events. It really made you feel like a hero. My final thoughts. I know my list of complaints is longer than the pros but that doesn't mean it's bad game by any means. It's very enjoyable to play and besides having the penny-pinch constantly the general experience is pretty positive with the other problems only popping up once in a while (except music, but that can be turned off). This one feels kinda like a less balanced Most Wanted (2012) but a bigger world. So if you like Need for Speed games definitely give this one a go.",4,3,0,909,3722,69,1236,52,7,74.06,7.27,6.58,10.03

"A racing game based around grinding. Recommended level, 380. Your level 260. Towards the end of the game (didn't beat, at beginning of the fifth chapter I'm guessing) your cars have to be near max (399), requiring you to grind the previous races like you would run in circles in a 90s era RPG. Story is very much nonsense. You can't buy one car, and change the specs to fit the 5 different types of racing in this game. You'll have to buy a new car for each type of race - of course - requiring you to grind for money or cards. You don't really buy or get parts, you get what are called cards - that are essentially the parts to upgrade your car. Drag racing sucks. NOS is useless as the car makes noise, the camera pulls back and shakes a bit - but your car goes no where. Did you miss that checkpoint - might as well restart the race. The game gives you some loot boxes called 'shipments'. Some cool one-time use cosmetic items, along with what they're calling tokens and chunks of in game currency. The tokens are used like you would on a slot machine. One roll/pull = 3 tokens. I think I had earned about 100 from the basic shipments, but went through them very quickly trying to complete a set of cards (parts) for my car at the end. You can also trade in the parts you've won for tokens (1:1), but you'll more than likely just sell them for cash. After beating one of the last few racers, I was then faced with having to grind again for another car, and I wasn't going to pay for the real money loot boxes. That's when I gave up. In the end, the way the game is setup is just garbage. Everything negative people are saying about this game is true. Ignore as there are racing games out now that are much better.

"Need for Speed Payback is a fun open world racer and you could do much worse than playing it, but its attempts at goading the player into using micro-transactions, uneven difficulty and attempts to crib open world design elements from Forza Horizon keep the game from being truly great. You play as three protagonists, Tyler, Mac and Jess as they race Fortune Valley a Las Vegas stand-in as they complete various racing, drifting, dirt, drag and getaway events to take down 'The House' a cartel that has been fixing street races and screwed over Tyler. Blah blah, the story is knock-off Fast & Furious schlocky tripe, but nobody plays racing games for the plot anyway. The game can look very good at times and the open world is fun to drive around in, mostly because of the open world activities you can do in it. Smashing billboards, breaking speed records, drifting, finding derelict cars and challenging roaming racers are all fun to do, and I know that because I had fun doing them in Forza Horizon. Still, for people who don't have access to an XBox One or a decent PC, this game can be a good replacement for Forza in its best moments. It's just too bad that the highs are counterbalanced by a vehicle upgrade system that, maybe true to the game's Las Vegas aesthetic feels less like upgrading a car and more like pulling a lever on a slot machine. To the game's credit, since it has been released the game has made its upgrade system kinder and gentler, putting less pressure on the player to give in and purchase micro-transactions. However simply having to engage with a randomized upgrade system that was designed to frustrate you into paying more left a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of them walking it back. Also, this game has some of the more ridiculously blatant rubber banding I've seen in a racing game in a long time. You will absolutely feel it when you eat wall and get sent to the back of the pack and the cars ahead of you slow down to give you a chance, just as you will when you're ahead and the cars always manage to stay close enough to pass you if you make one single mistake, no matter how high you've leveled your car. This ties back into the micro-transactions; the game seems to purposefully try to frustrate you so you will go to the store and pull the level on the slot machine and hope you get something useful. Forget about being the same level as an event being enough to beat it; I found that you need to be at least 15 to 20 levels higher before your chances of winning went from being a coin toss to likely. All in all, it's an okay game, but people with access to Forza Horizon 3 should just get that instead.",3,1,0,501,2108,30,697,14,17,52.82,14.78,8.11,16.71
"Its not the worst entry, however its obvious that the game was built to please the publisher and satisfy their vision of the series instead of the players. When you first see the open world it appears to be filled with a lot of activities to do. However, the deceptive nature of this becomes apparent as you progress. Pretty much all the story sections are quite dull due to bad writing and the game has too much grinding. The free roaming areas lack random diversion like police roaming around to avoid or a running into a random pack of cars to take out. In the end, the remaining side activities like challenge races while a little enjoyable are not sufficient to keep you coming back. Having to go through unfun bits in hopes for some fun is simply not acceptable. Also, a lot of the cool customization options which used be given as rewards can now simply be purchased by anyone through microtransactions which makes you feel less like you're unique or skilled and that's also not a good thing.",2,1,0,182,806,17,264,8,11,61.03,10.4,8.94,12.84

"If you were interested in this game because of its E3 gameplay, then dont buy it. That gameplay was a lie. It depicted the game as being a Fast N Furious like game, and that isnt true. Its story is very bad and only features a handful of those FNF style missions. And even those arent good. The graphics and gameplay feel as if theyre modern, yet everything else feels like the game hasnt changed since Undercover. It directly borrows things from NFS 2015 without any changes or improvements. Its 'diverse' open world is very empty, but filled with pointless collectibles. Its new card based upgrade system is terrible and ruins parts of the game. Collecting cars is no longer easy because each car needs to be upgraded with a new set of cards. And upgrading is now dependent on luck and grinding. Its just a bad idea. If youre looking for just an arcade racing game, then youll be fine with a Payback. Though I recommend getting it on sale. If youre expecting a much improved NFS game with a well done story and set of characters, then do not get this. A lot of people didnt like NFS 2015.

The map is huge and the open world is great. Also the different style of races like street, off-road and drift is neat. I like the off-road option.

"It has fun arcade racing mechanics and looks nice. Yet it somehow fails to be the core game that I look for in a NFS game. For me, that is being able to customize a car to be fast and to look as cool (ridiculous) as possible. While this game does have some very fun cars, the derelicts somehow are not the customizable powerhouses I would've expected. Since you have to unlock new cars to buy through racing, you're never incentivized to switch cars because you have to then grind out new cards to upgrade every car. Nothing carries over except the currency which gets used up pretty quickly when buying new cards. Somehow the game comes up short and the grind, which I don't want in a racing game, gets boring quickly.",2,1,0,136,570,10,187,7,9,70.79,8.21,7.32,10.71
"It seem as though people are giving this game a low star rating because of the micro and hate that you have to drive so far to get to a race event. Not a problem because on my way there I'm breaking speed trap records ( which gives you earnings). Crashing through Billboards etc. I can care less about the voice as one mentioned did not like the voice of characters and complaints about how to upgrade your vehicle but the vehicle that I have now is way better than more than half of what the dealerships had to offer from manually upgrading it.. you do not have to accept all upgrades because sometimes when you upgrade something you might lose something from overall performance like if you upgrade your brakes, you will lose horsepower ( not a lot) but you will be informed before you accept by looking at your side bar attributes. Great graphics and gameplay wins my heart. Its not a perfect game but it's pretty close to it. if you think about it from a higher scale prospective then you will understand why I gave this 5 stars",5,1,0,192,826,14,258,8,11,68.79,9.63,8.26,12.52

"This is the first time I have ever played a Civ game but I have always been interested in the series. I tell you this because I do not have any knowledge as to what has been improved or what new additions have been added to the game. This review is specifically for those that are looking for a strategy game to play. This game plays from a top down view although you are allowed to zoom in very closely. I'd compare this game similar to a board game but I want to be careful with that description as its really not like that. You start off with a choosing which leader you want to play as and must claim land to which to build your civilization. Every turn you make decisions as to what you can research to expand your knowledge of new tech or policies. Your cities must be expanded through addition of various buildings that grant benefits such as increasing science. You select what characters to create much in the same manner as rts games and must wait a set amount off turns before you can use them. You can move them around the map to either scout, claim land, or battle cities or other infantry. The game is a very long game though as you start off in BC and go well into the 2000s. It has lots of complexities, which I believe adds many exciting things to do within the game. I'm sorry if I'm confusing or not providing lots of detail but trying to explain how this game works is best left to a video. If you are looking for a game that has lots of replay ability and lets you build a civilization from nothing and see how far you can take them, then I recommend this game.",5,10,0,308,1257,25,416,14,9,70.24,8.93,6.85,12.05
"I've been playing Civilization since the first installment. I even have Civilization VI for the PC. I bought this version with some concern about how well the game would transfer to console button controls. My hope however was having the game on the Switch would make it much more convenient and comfortable way to play. My hopes were pleasantly confirmed. Although it takes a bit of getting used to it is clear a lot of thought was put into the button mapping and control scheme of the game. Less than half way through my first game everything was second nature for me. I even used buttons in handheld mode over the touch screen. Playing portability on the switch is super convenient. Playing docked with split joy-cons on a large screen is very relaxing and comfortable. I'd play Civilization this way over using my computer every time. It should be noted this version of Civ 6 does only supports local wireless (2 Switches, 2 games, same place) multiplayer. I've never been interested in multiplayer for this game, so that doesn't bother me.",5,5,0,186,841,18,273,13,8,68.14,7.31,8.72,9.59

"I have been playing Sid Miers Civilazation since it was first released in the early nineties. I absolutely love this series. I was very skeptical at first when I saw it had been ported to a console, particularly Nintendo since they are mostly kid like games. But, I was also somewhat excited. I have transitioned from pc gaming to consoles for many reasons and was excited by the possibility of playing Civ on a 55inch tv. But would it be good or flaky? Well, its not good, but amazing!!!!! Very easy controls, very simple to navigate, beautiful graphics (especially in 4K HD), and the depth of play is definitely there. All the reports, statistics, information, choices, everything is there and fairly easy to find. I can now sit and relax on my couch or gaming chair in the living room and play my belov d Civ series game. Im a very happy camper.

Granted this is a first-gen PS4 game (ported from PS3/360) vs a late-game Switch title, so it really shouldn't be too much of a surprise. There is some detail pop-in at short draw distances, and the PS4 version runs at a noticeably higher frame rate (on the Pro), they're really only noticeable if you compare them side-by-side. The character models and textures look about the same, and all the spoken dialogue and shanties are present as well.

Bonus download included- HQ pictures, videos, manga, Blackbeards journal... this game is chock-full of content. If every game ported to Switch was this good we wouldnt have any problems.

The process is simple: after you purchase the digital version, Best Buy e-mails you with a 16-digit code, which is what you input into the Switch eShop under the 'Enter Code' option. The game downloads immediately once you have successfully entered the code. It is a 13+ GB download, so depending on your internet connection, it will take awhile, but the game is worth it! I've only had the game for a day, but I can say this game is a must have, especially for Zelda fans! It is a well crafted game, the mechanics work well, and now you can take an HD Zelda title on the go! The world is huge, so I know it will take me quite a while to explore everything!",5,4,0,203,852,15,283,9,10,66,9.66,7.57,11.98
"The game is incredible! I was nervous to purchase the electronic version of the game outside of Nintendo but I was pleasantly surprised by the ease to purchase through best buy!

"As a child I played all the zelda but Ocarina of Time literally changed my video game expectations.

"I have only played it for about 5-10% of its size. In my very limited gaming experience, my favorite type of game used to be combat racing. Zelda (Breath of the Wild) may have changed that for me. I love the technical side of it. The sound makes me feel like I am there, in nature. The only part that I don't like about it (and it's not Zelda in particular, but these types of games) is the complexity of things that you acquire, the large number items that you can have in your inventory and use to cook, for example. I repeat that my video-gaming experience is limited, but this title has redefined my expectations of what is possible in terms of beauty, art, direction, and technics, especially on such modest hardware as the switch. I purchased the game and tried it because of hearing people about the experience of it being special, and it did deliver; now Zelda holds a special place in my heart too!",5,1,0,172,711,17,247,8,9,63.52,9.74,7.13,12.55

"So I accidentally purchased the digital copy of this game, which from what I have researched, happens to Best Buy online customers a lot. Depending on where you add to your cart, there is not much to tell you if you are loading the digital or physical copy. Even the image of the game for digital purchase if of the physical copy of the game. I thought that Best Buy would be reasonable and provide an exchange for a physical copy, given that I had not redeemed the digital copy. I was wrong. In fact, the online customer service agent told me that I had to do this at a store (why?), only to be told by them it could not be done. I am very disappointed, since this was to be a gift. Suffice it to say, I will never shop at Best Buy again.",1,0,2,146,575,15,203,9,6,72.74,7.14,5.53,10.6

"Divinity Original Sin 2 has upped the game for turn-based 'Western' role playing games to a point that it's hard to imagine it getting any better, in regards to game systems, controls, and handling, barring some major controller change to the next generation. Surely, the next gen PS5 will offer more in the way of graphics, loading times, or other technical increases, but as for porting over a game that relies on using a good chunk of a keyboard on PC to a console controller, this may be the very best we'll have, and it's great. As great as it is, the 'handling' would be nothing more than a wishlist item for a completely different game if the game itself wasn't any good, but Larian Studios continues with its amazing pedigree. You'll have a group of 4 heroes chosen among 8 characters, all with their own fully fleshed story, or, if you choose, you can create your own. (The heroes they offer are excellent, and I'd recommend beginning with one of them. They introduce you into the gigantic array of systems easier. Even these pre-made heroes are customizable almost entirely from the ground up, so you'll be able to change a fighter hero to your preferred class right from the outset!) Their stories and their characterizations are done so well, you'll want to see them all play out! Choice is perhaps the biggest thing here in DOS2. Every step of the way, you're truly in control. From choosing your class to interacting with other characters, whether they be major or minor characters, you truly 'run the show'. And it's much more than surface level- you won't just have a character class, spells, and attributes to choose from, but talents and backgrounds that help shape your story and how the world and its inhabitants engage with you. (Highly recommend 'Pet Pal,' which allows you to speak with animals, which are fully voiced!) Choices will also shape the world, as decisions are permanent. Accidentally hit an onlooker during a battle, and they'll attack. Steal from or kill an NPC, and they or villagers may seek revenge, shun you, or close off quests you may have otherwise received from them. Beyond choice, DOS2 offers an 'innovative common sense' method of play. In a day and age where every game seems to take pride in hiding behind obtuse systems, DOS2's will almost seem easy to overlook in battle, even in the non-hurried gameplay of taking turns. Cast a rain spell, causing enemies to be standing in a puddle, then zap them all with one lightning bolt. Knock over a barrel of oil, then set it ablaze to force enemies to bunch up at a chokepoint. (Or, in a personal example, launching a water arrow at a teammate who had been set on fire to put him out!) What else makes DOS2 stand out among RPGs? You can play online to adventure with up to 3 other players. (Even in single player, you can split your adventurers and tackle 2 quests at the same time, if you choose, as you're also able to take direct control over anybody on your team). You can even play couch co-op with a friend or family member. Even more intriguing is the 'Game Master' mode, where up to 5 players play together, with one controlling the game's narrative as the GM. DOS2 is, with very little wiggle room for debate, among the very top of the list of RPGs available for a console. You can argue for some of the Eastern style RPGs with some moxy, but among the Western style, it IS the best. But, be warned, if Final Fantasy or Persona is what you're looking for, DOS2 is not it. It's still completely recommended, being the masterpiece that it is, but it is a different playstyle. It's Dungeons & Dragons in a digital form that's advanced further than the old Icewind Dales and the like from 15 years ago. It's a more complicated, more micro-managed game and takes lots of patience and a frequent willingness to save the game, especially early, as you learn the game. (Pretty sound advice to save often here, no matter your experience). It's a time-consumer, so set plenty of time aside when you pop this in. If you're looking for one of the greatest RPGs ever made, your next addiction that will eat up over 100 hours to play through, then leave you heading back in with a new party to experience it from different eyes, DOS2 simply cannot be passed up!",5,3,0,787,3343,71,1121,35,10,63.51,9.99,7.86,12.6
"This felt way too similar to actually playing the magic card game. Just a weird gameplay for someone who isn't used to it. I started to play it but was so taken aback by it that I didn't play it for a bit but the pandemic had other plans for me! I eventually became used to the gameplay.

This is a game the will reward you with hundreds of hours of entertainment or have you rage quitting in your first hour if youre not prepared. This isnt a pickup and play kind of game but well worth the effort needed to master or at least achieve competency in.",5,1,0,80,350,4,109,4,10,71.27,8.29,8.44,10

"Only a few hours in but I can say the gameplay is much more polished then its predecessor. Menus, inventory and such are much more streamlined and organized. Visuals are tenfold better with HDR and 4K support. I spent nearly 45 minutes creating a character with the endless amount of skills and combinations you can use. Battle takes alot to get used to, as it did in the first game. I'm never a fan of putting a game to 'easy' as I always enjoy the challenge. But much like the first game, this game is guilty of punishing you early. I enjoy exploring in RPGs, and pushing the boundaries. But unfortunately this game makes you pay for it early on. If you steal and get caught, or go somewhere you're not supposed to, chances are you will be thrust into a battle against multiple enemies 10x's as strong. But battles that are storyline related you will fair pretty well against. It may sound ridiculous listing this as a gripe, but i dont enjoy having to quit and restart multiple times simply because I ticked off one NPC and the entire tavern turned against me.",4,1,0,197,846,17,282,12,8,69.07,7.7,7.65,10.02

The one thing I was a little bummed about was the fact that it's a turn style based combat system. it's not horrible I was just looking for the type of system found in diablo.

The farming mechanics are simple to understand as are the quests and relationship building mechanics. The battle system is fairly basic with just one attack button and a few spells, but it is still fun to play. The only downside is that the details of some of the mechanics are hidden behind certain conversations with characters that do not always trigger before you have to use a mechanic, so sometimes I found myself having to google the mechanics to understand the game.",4,1,0,102,464,13,154,4,13,53.22,12.17,9.79,15.3
"Rune Factory 4 is my personal favorite Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons type game. I had it on 3DS, and was happy to have the chance to get this Switch version. It has more exploration and combat than other games of this type, and its possible to get more done in the early game than in something like Stardew Valley. For me, it makes the game more fun. Being a 3DS game first, this port might not look amazing vs recently developed Switch games, but it does benefit from a higher resolution, stable performance, and a few minor extras. I like the NPCs in this game a lot. They seem to have a lot more things they can say vs other games of this type, and sometimes their own little story elements. I think they add more personality to the game vs similar games. They can also help you fight if you want, with their each villager behaving differently. Like one may fight with a sword, where another might try to help by throwing food at you if you get hurt.",5,1,0,181,753,18,244,10,8,74.42,7.38,7.03,11.22

They are terrible. You sound like you are at a carnival 24/7 in this game with a pinball machine in the background and it gets really annoying. It wouldn't be so bad if you can turn down the music... but you can't. I finally decided to turn OFF the music and it is MUCH better. This is more like a port of a 3DS game than a remaster. If they had updated the music then this would be a solid 5 stars for me because everything else is fantastic. It has a very nice reward system throughout the game and you really feel like you are progressing even though there is a lot of grinding... and that is a good thing.",4,0,3,156,616,17,213,13,4,79.14,5.2,4.95,9.16

It just keept getting better all the way to its fun and creative conclusion. There are many good games now that make PSVR worth the investment, but this game by itself makes it worth the purchase. It's a true system seller and more than worthy of all the good reviews it's gotten. For those of you old enough to remember the feelings of pure fun and joy you had the first time you played Mario 64 in the 90's, be prepared to have those feelings.

You will easily double that playtime if you do the additional challenge levels and content. Lots to do. It's a game that must be experienced, since describing it or watching previews on flat screens doesn't do it justice. Most VR games are like that, but this one especially so. After God of War, and Spiderman I would easily put this among them for game of the year contender. It does so much with the medium. It's rare for me when a game gets better each level you progress. Just when you think they could not possibly top themselves... they do. There is a demo now, so try before you buy if you must. Stay away from spoilers too if possible.

It took me around 6 hours to get through the campaign while hunting down as many collectibles as I could along the way. Many more hours were spent finding the remainder. If you've got a PSVR, or are on the fence about buying one, this is a must have, milestone of a title. I sincerely hope we will see sequels in the future.",5,1,0,157,700,19,235,9,9,62.5,8.88,8.72,11.82

"I like this game. Its fun, but I dont love it. I grew up playing the older Pokmon games. The ones for gameboy color, gameboy SP, etc. its been hard for me to get used to the new look and style of the newer games. I think the last newer Pokmon game I played was Pokmon X. I skipped over the original Sun and Moon. I picked up Ultra Sun and honestly I feel like its almost too easy. Eventually in the game you get a map and on the map theres a flag basically showing where you need to go. I hate that. Its honestly driving me nuts. In the older games you kind of just walked around aimlessly and figured out where to go on your own. I just feel like youre guided too much throughout the game. Which I suppose is ok for younger kids playing. I feel like if youre new to Pokmon and have never played the older versions youll love it. But for me the newer versions just arent the same!",3,7,0,177,685,9,233,16,3,84.24,4.26,4.28,6.46
"Similar to Pokemon Black and White 2; Pokmon Ultra Moon takes place in the same area as Pokemon Sun, Alola but with an alternate storyline, new pokemon to collect and a few new features. Here are the list of changes/additions: 1. Story puts emphasis on the legendary Pokmon Necrozma. The core story of the Alolan trails stay the same. Alola map layout is the same with exception of a few new buildings, a new mini-island Ultra Megalopolis and worm hole. 3/4 of the game will feel very familiar to you plot wise if you played the original sun/moon 2. New enemy Group: Ultra Recon Squad and Team Rainbow Rocket. You can fight against all team rocket leaders in past games such as Giovanni (Pokmon Red and Blue) to Lysandre (Pokmon X and Y). 3. 3 new Ultra Beasts: UB Assembly, UB Burst and UB Adhesive 4. 8 trails instead of 7, with the 8th trail captain being Mina. 5. New legendary Pokmon Necrozma with Dusk Mane, Dawn Wings, and Ultra forms. You get the forms by absorbing legendary Pokmon Solgaleo and/or Lunala. 6. New Partner Cap Pikachu. It's just a Pikachu with Ash's (?) hat. New Lycanroc Dusk Form 7. New Z-Moves Clangorous Soulblaze - Kommo-o Splintered Stormshards - Lycanroc Searing Sunraze Smash - Solgaleo and Dusk Mane Necrozoma Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom - Lunala and Dawn Wings Necrozma Let's Snuggle Forever - Mimikyu Light That Burns the Sky - Ultra Necrozma 8. Mega Stones are also returning, but you have to find them 9. SOS battles. Now toned down, instead of wild pokemon calling unlimited SOS pokmeon it's just 1 this time 10. new clothing options will be available for players to purchase 11. Battle Agency. Battle random trainers with rental pokemon. The more battles you win the more rare rental pokemon you get and prizes you earn 12. Mantne Surf. As you fast travel from island to island, you can play a mini game where you ride Mantne through the ocean waves and preform tricks racking up points for a while score which can get you rewards. 13. Ultra Wormhole. Similar to Mantne surf where you play a mini-game (fly through rings) to travel to the Ultra Space where you fight and collect rare/legendary pokemon the further down you go. In this game you can literally get all legendaries from past generations if you own both games (list provided later on) 14. Alola Photo Club. Take photos with your pokemon, and add stamps/borders to the photos taken with more stamps/borders unlocked as you submit more photos 15. Totem Stickers. Replacement of collecting Zygard Cells in the original games. By collecting them you can trade them for Totem pokemon. 16. New Moves: Mind Blown - Fire-type Move. Learned by UB Burst. Photon Geyser - Psychic-type Move Plasma Fists - Electric-type Move. Learned by Zeraor 17. Roto-Loto. You can now be friends with Rotom (your pokedex) and unlock gives you items your pokemon can carry to increase stats such as exp gain,better friendship, more prize money from fighting trainers, faster egg hatching, use Z-move twice during battle, etc 18. Pokemon differences between Ultra Sun and Moon. No new alolan forms, but the ones in the original is still present. Here are a list of exclusive pokemon in each: -Ultra Sun-Exclusive Pokemon Alolan Vulpix Alolan Ninetales Houndour Houndoom Cranidos Rampardos Cottonee Whimsicott Tirtouga Carracosta Rufflet Braviary Lurantis (Totem-sized) Passimian Turtonator -Ultra Sun-Exclusive Legendaries Ho-oh Raikou Groudon Latios Dialga Heatran Reshiram Tornadus Xerneas Buzzwole Kartana Dusk Mane Necrozma UB-Burst -Ultra Moon-Exclusive Pokemon Alolan Sandshrew Alolan Sandslash Electrike Manectric Shieldon Bastiodon Petilil Lilligant Archen Archeops Vullaby Mandibuzz Salazzle (Totem-sized) Oranguru Drampa -Ultra Moon-Exclusive Legendaries Lugia Entei Kyogre Latias Palkia Regigigas Zekrom Thundurus Yveltal Lunala Pheromosa Celesteela Dawn Wings Necrozma UB-Assembly 19. New pokemon aside from those already mentioned: Stakataka Blacephalon Poipole Naganadel Zeraora Hope the list of changes help you in your purchasing decision. If you find anything else, please put it in the comments === Now I'll post my original review of Pokemon Sun: Huge changes to the pokemon formula since Pokemon X & Y, no longer as it's strictly battle and collecting focused (although still present) as they added variety of mechanics to switch things up a bit and to bring more variety in gameplay. Changes include: 1. No HMs No longer do you have to carry around a HM slave (s). This has bothered me in the past games as I have to restrict 1 or 2 slots out of my party of 6 to help traverse certain areas of the world. In the place of HMs there are Pok Rides where you can ride pokemon interacting with them on the world map, some you may not be able to access until you've completed mission within the game. 2. Is it super effective? No longer do you have to look up guides online (unless it's your first encounter) to tell if a move is super effective or not very effective against the pokemon you're up against. After you battle a pokemon once, the game will tell you what moves is super effective or not in the battle menu once you encounter the same pokemon the second time. 3. No Traditional Gyms No longer do you have to battle your way through gym after gym to prove you're the best out of brute force. There are 4 islands in the game, each of which are controlled by 4 Island Kahunas To get to them you have to get pass Trail Captains and Todum Pokemon Trail captain will give you quizzes, side quests to complete, and/or fight in traditional battles Todum Pokemon. Basically typical pokemon you find the wild, but significantly stronger and have grunts that help them battle. 4. Rotom Pokdex Typical pokedex, but with a face and personality attached to it. 5. Alola Forms Basically different forms of pokemon you seen in previous generations. Either it's there physical form that is different and/or the pokemon's typing 6. Z-Moves With a Z-Ring and a Z-Crystal you can use a pokemon's ultimate move once per battle. It's not like Mega Evolutions where it stays constant 7. QR Scanner. You can now scan QR codes to get event pokemon 8. Battle Royal A 4 player free-for-all where the battle ends after all of one's pokemon trainer's faints. They tally the win-losses of each trainer and the one with best stats at the end wins 9. Hyper Training. Once a pokemon reaches level 100, they can go through hyper training which can improve a Pokemon's IV 10. Pok Pelago Your PC Box now has functionality to it. It's like a day care sort of thing, instead of just depositing your pokemon, you can passively train them in the PC or have them search for items 11. Festival Plaza. An online mode where you can battle other trainers and trade with them. You get festial coins for each interaction which you can spend on clothes, shop or upgrade your pokemon's stats. There's also missions you can undertake to get more coins. 12. Night and Day phase, New Pokemon Pokemon Sun goes the traditional time route while Moon does the opposite. In Pokemon Moon if you're playing in the daytime, the game will consider it night time in-game. Some events also play out differently like different Totum Pokemon on the same island/trail In traditional Pokemon fashion you can only get some pokemon in each version so trading is required either with a friend or if you own both versions. Also some pokemon evolve differently in each version now. I'd say some of overall models of new pokemon are better looking than the last batch in previous iterations of the pokemon series. 13. Auto Run Your run is as fast as a bike now, and it has unlimited use. You can now move in all directions instead of the traditional 4 and it feels very fluid 14. No Rod Fishing is now dedicated to specific regions in the world. You cannot fish wherever you want anymore. 15. Photo Taking You can now take Photos of pokemon in the wild. 16. Team Skull and Aether Foundation Team Skull is the new antagonist group like Team Rocket, but they have a new style to them as they try act gangster-ish with their animated hand gesters/movements. They have more personality and have a darker tone to their backstory and mission. Aether Foundation is the opposite of Team Skull as their mission is to cure injured and hurt pokemon. The group is also conducting research on the Ultra Beast (Pokemon) which is a good mystery story in and of itself. 17. Graphical Upgrade Game looks better than the last, although there are some pixelation around the edges still. Models look more realistic than before, and the battle animations are more visually impressive. There are some framerate issues on 2v2 battles for some reason, but then again I own the launch 3DS. You may not have the issue if you own the New 3DS? It's a turn-based system so it doesn't really matter much in terms of gameplay, but the slow down is noticeable 18. Pokemon Refresh Similar to Pokemon amie but with more grooming options -Returning mechanics: Pokebank return, you can now transfer all your pokemon to Sun and Moon Clothing Options: Although more options are available, it still feel very limited. Mega Evolutions return, but none for new pokemon from what i've discovered Overall, love the changes to the traditional formula as it gives the Pokemon Series a nice refresh and is more streamline to play.",5,6,0,1647,7452,259,2556,107,8,59.92,8.73,8.88,12.45

"Loved Pokemon Sun and Moon, so to go back to my favorite location Alola Islands in Ultra is a treat! If you're just a casual fan and already played Sun and/or Moon, you may be okay to pass.

"Taking the traditional addictive gameplay and introducing a number of quality life improvements over the last generation make this the best refinement of the series yet. From visual improvments, such as moree realistically proportioned characters and a smarter camera which gives a better indication of the surrouundings, to the lower screen map (why did it take this long?) and lack of HMs (replaced with ridable Pokemon), your Pokemon-hunting mission is better than ever. The gym system is replaced by trials. Even if they usually boil down to simply defeating pokemon and trainers, there's usually some unique mechanic tied to starting the battles, such as cooking up a stew, or taking pictures of ghosts which can only be seen using a special camera. Much like the creative gyms of X/Y, each feels like you're doing something unique, even if it is mostly just window dressing. The only downside is the clothing options. Some of the more outlandish clothing options, like punk clothes, torn graments, and crop tops. Instead, everything feels like they could come from the same store, and approved by schools for use as uniforms. It's a small complaint, but as NPCs have access to these outfits, it would be nice to give us the option to dress the way we want. With the Pokedex now topping just over 800, you've got a lot of critters to catch. Luckily you can import your past catches through the Pokemon Bank and Transporter, though there is a yearly subscription fee that must be paid. The campaign is fairly robust, and there is a lot to do once you finish it. Very highly recommended. It's just a shame this is the last Pokemon game to be released for the 3DS. At least it's ending on a high point, and will keep us busy until the next proper installment reaches the Switch next year.",5,1,0,318,1434,39,472,16,10,61.09,9.68,9.23,12.86

"If this is your first dabble with Gen VII of Pokemon, get this version! Better Legendaries in-game, the real time clock is set to standard daytime, the bulk of the exclusives are superior (Alolan Vulpix, Houndour line, Passimian, Blacephalon, etc.). The downside is that if you like Blue, Green, Purple, and Grey, the clothing and Festival Plaza's exclusives in UltraMoon or Moon are a better choice. You can still get Midnight Lycanroc in the wild later on, if that's what you were on the fence about. As for the game itself, the story is nearly the same as Sun/Moon until you get to post game. That's when a familiar face, as well as many others, pop in. The graphics push the limits of the classic 3DS, the system I still play on. The only thing that really slows it down is double battles. I prefer the music in these entries to original SM, especially the Ultra Recon Squad's battle theme. My recommendation is to start getting familiar with the Festival Plaza asap. It's the best way to get Poke Balls, Waters, and other items for DIRT cheap. That way you can use Poke Dollars for TMs, clothes, and other expenses. Festival Plaza also allows you to get tons of character customization outfits for talking to other people on Wi-Fi. And all it takes is just to link to the Pokemon Global Link. You can do a simple Random Trade, or deposit a Pokemon to trade for ones you don't have, and then you get A LIST of other players to get shops and clothes from. I like to check daily because people will have entire outfits that are hard to get, and the currency in Festival Plaza is just answering text questions! Poke Pelago is also excellent for getting gobs of Berries, Fossils, Gold Bottle Caps, evolutionary stones, and even EVing Pokemon! You just deposit them onto the island, and come back a day later. This is sooo convenient for us that have jobs where we can't play Pokemon all day long. This is a good way to get perfectly EVed Pokemon, and even raise their levels for doing nothing. You get Poke Pelago on the second island after battling the Fire Trial, which is about 2/5ths the way in to the main game. Some new additions like Mantine Ride, battle poses, Ultra Space, and some BROKEN Z Stones are sure to entice people as well. Mantine Ride is the best way to get Move Tutors of any generation yet, as you get to play Tony Hawk on the back of manta while dodging Tentacruels in the surf. I average about 9 points per ride, which equates to quite a few really useful moves for just 4 minutes of the mini game. Things like Knock Off, Stealth Rocks, Gunk Shot, Heal Bell, and Liquidation are highly coveted moves not only in-game but also for online battling. The only reason I gave this one star less is that it's almost a carbon copy of Sun. We did this 20 years ago with things like Yellow and Crystal, but the difference is that Sun and Moon are very small games. They're in a tiny area, and the main story is shorter than say Black/White. Also, I cannot stand SOS Battles, and in these games you are forced to endure that mechanic all through the generation. But if this is your first experience with Gen VII, it's an easy 5/5. Another great Pokemon entry and a gorgeous sendoff for the highly successful Nintendo 3DS.",4,1,0,608,2548,60,872,32,8,66.22,8.74,7.28,11.55

It was always poor timing when I went to see my Dad because it was always when something super important was about to happen in the show: Goku vs. Frieza. Since then I have always wanted a DBZ game that told the entire story. I am so happy with this game it connected all the dots that had been blank as a kid from the show. What a great game!

"Honestly, if you're not a big Dragon Ball Z person, this game easily gets a 6/10 score. Side missions are a joke, background and scenery graphics look like they should be from the PS2 era. That being said, the voice acting and scenes from the main story line are fantastic. I got around 40 hours from the main story, so you're getting plenty of content for what you're paying for. That being said, as I said before, the side missions are a waste of time. For starters, 95% of them aren't even voiced. Secondly, they're just fetch quests. Go get me 5 of these items. Go take this to this person. Awful. So, if you loved DBZ like I did, the Nostalgia makes it worth it. Otherwise, you can probably avoid. Would I pay full price again for it? Probably not. If you can get your hands on it for half off or so, then that's perfect in my eyes!",3,1,0,167,642,9,212,15,3,88.14,3.73,4.15,6.61

Palace reworks and enhancements, new characters and interactions with previously existing characters, and small tweaks or additions to gameplay or the story make P5R stand above the original. Plus, it appears to be running at or near 4K on a PS4 Pro, so that is a big bonus, as the original was limited to 1080p.

"Graphics: absolutely gorgeous. Sound/voice: every environment feels alive. Play with a high quality set of headphones to take advantage of the 360 recordings they made. The voices Senua hears throughout the game are very haunting and eerie. The actress who shares her likeness for the character Senua gave a brilliant performance. I loved those cutscenes where the camera is right up on her face and she gives it her all to convey this person going through some awful stuff. Gameplay: I think this is where people might start differing in opinion. The game has a linear path to follow with some slight openness to it (think of the first Uncharted game). Theres some environmental puzzles you need to solve that can be challenging at times and some can get a little tedious. Another thing Ive notice people complain about is the combat system. For me I quite enjoyed it. Its simple, yes but it gets the job done. Youve got to understand that this isnt a God of War game (apart from maybe the visuals) where youre chaining these combos up with some very punchy attacks. Hellblade is more of wait for an opportunity to strike, then strike. Theres an attack coming, dodge. With that said the way the camera is positioned, it all seems very cinematic and for me I enjoyed that. So in conclusion if you like that Viking setting and want a good but dark and depressing tale pick this one up.

Considering how this title features done of the most realistic and impressive visuals this generation, I would say that they succeeded in that goal. While the game is somewhat short (8-10 hour playthrough), the story is still very much worth experiencing, as it tackles themes of mental illness in ways no other game has, and the performances are poinient and powerful, making the mystic and surreal story still feel real and believable.

Great art direction. Keeps you invested in the main character Senua. Combat system is pretty easy to get used to after a few fights. Without giving away a spoiler, I like the fact that the game added a mechanic that makes you think about your fights (too many deaths result in complete lost progress). No facerolling through this game. A lot of puzzles. Some stealth, exploration, and gathering involved in game. Each boss fight adds a new element on top of the normal enemies. Highly recommend this game for anyone that enjoys single player games. Made by Ninja Theory, same team that worked on ps3 game Heavenly Sword (also a short game) and Devil May Cry series.

"Excellent graphics. Excellent sound. Maybe not as good graphics as God of War 4, but it can certainly compete with it. Now, this being a game by Ninja Theory, you would expect stylish, stunning, intense fights. The fights feel shockingly primitive, so predictable, and you barely have to combine buttons, which makes the game feel too easy. I've been playing the game for 20 minutes and i've done nothing but run around solving pointless puzzles, fight boring fights. Simulation of Psychosis, and excellent sound are pretty much what makes this game feel special, and that's about it. I dont feel like playing it after 20 minutes.

"I really enjoyed this edition of the series, I was very excited to get it for the Switch. Game play is just as I remember it and the graphics are smooth, just remember that you can save as many files as you want, but to load a save file you have to close the came and restart it. Please be aware that the cartridge only comes with FFX on it physically, and it has X2 on the menu but grayed out until you go to the Nintendo eShop and use the code that comes inside the box to download X2 and have it install on the Switch itself. This concerns me, as the impression it gives is that this cartridge contains both games, not one game and a download. I'm worried that when I loan it to my son to play on his switch, will he have to download the rest to play X2? Will he be able to? Will he be able to use the same code that came with the game? Is the code a 1 time use code? If the X2 is installed on the unit itself, can I play it without the cartridge? I haven't tested any of these questions yet since I've been playing FFX non-stop since i bought it, but it bothers me that this was not explained until I opened the packaging, opened the case, and found a slip of paper with a tiny sentence saying to go to the Nintendo eShop and enter the code to get the rest of the game.",5,7,1,264,989,10,330,10,10,74.29,9.46,5.11,12.08

I had wanted it for a handheld, portable device, but when it was released on the PS Vita, I was a broke college student who couldn't afford the game, much less the Vita to play it. Now that I am older, and have a steady income, I preordered this for the Switch the day I was able. And I don't regret it one bit! The graphics are amazing! So much so, if you pay attention you can see little mistakes that didn't matter in the original version, but in HD can be seen. Does that take away from the game at all? NO!! The story line is just as wonderful as I remember, and being able to play Final Fantasy X on the go is a dream come true. My main/only complaint is that FFX-2 was a download code, and not actually on the cartridge or on its own. I can understand why they did that, but I don't like it.

Only complaints are that load times between scenes are a bit sluggish and that FFX-2 is a download code, it's not on the cartridge. I don't get that, it seems that it should have been on the cartridge or if they do not make a cartridge with enough storage, then a second cartridge be packaged for FFX-2.

The dreaded 'Resident Evil' camera is in full effect, and even in a pretty linear game, it's not totally clear what you're supposed to do next. While the mechanics are definitely outdated, the graphics are still stunning, and the voice acting is really good. What kept me going through this kinda clunky game was the story and characters, which I enjoy a lot. Best Buy's rating system only does full stars, but I would say it's a 3 and a half.",3,0,2,132,521,14,189,6,9,63.37,9.89,6.06,13.04

This is one of the top 3 games I have ever had the privilege to play and love the story and progression system. Last time I played it I logged 180 hours in to it.

"This game has personally become my favorite kart racer even 1 UPing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe because of its skill ceiling and rewarding gameplay when you master the controls. Its way faster, more responsive, and puts you in control but, I do have a WARNING. This game is way harder than Mario Kart 8 in every way and if you are completely new to this game DO NOT PUT THE DIFFICULTY TO HARD YOU WILL REGRET IT. Hard should be categorized as INSANE because the A.I. does not hold back at all and will completely focus you and will catch up extremely quickly when you are in the lead. So start off with the difficulty on easy, you will thank me later. Once you finish adventure mode then start ramping up the difficulty. Other than that the amount of tracks, character customization, and adventure mode are Amazing.",5,4,0,148,646,17,218,9,8,65.53,8.2,8.07,11.17
"Single Player: I believe there are 31 tracks to race in this game, all of them are a blast; although there is a learning curve that can be a bit strong for players new to kart racers. Solid A. Couch Co-op: My kids and I are having a great time racing and playing the battle modes. Most notably are the flag capture and crystal collecting battle modes. It will frustrate you in all the right ways. A+. Online multiplayer: I'm not waiting too long for matches, and the races run smoothly. The learning curve is the steepest here, you are required to fully understand thid game's mechanics to place high in these races. I haven't tried the battle modes online yet, i'll review those at a later time. Solid A. Performance: I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches in this game, and the FPS remains stable, even during all of the explosions and madness that can happen in 4 player couch co-op battle modes. The game looks beautiful. A+. Cons: Activision has you flip through a total of some 60+ pages of terms and conditions before playing the game for the first time. You can breeze through in seconds, but it was a little rediculous. I haven't seen any microtransactions yet, so hopefully they aren't ever added. Final notes: Unless you want to play this game on the go, the PS4 version is the definitive way to play. It includes extra skins, stickers (in-game), and if i'm not mistaken, the retro track is PS4 exclusive too. If you like Mario Kart, this is a bit more challenging of a game. If you like the original CTR games, you'll love this itteration. At $40, it's a great value.",5,3,0,300,1235,20,417,21,6,74.74,6.38,6.33,8.38

"I almost waited for a price drop on this but it is totally worth paying full price for. I initially thought CTR didn't deserve a remaster and they should move on to new games. Well, now I consider it one of the best remasters ever. I liked the Crash Trilogy remasters, but I felt like they weren't good enough to make me never play the originals again. I played the og CTR for about an hour before getting this and I can confidently say I never need to play that one again. This update is that good. They went above and beyond with this. The speed and handling of the carts is so much better. There are twice as many characters and twice as many tracks as the original. The level designs are exquisite, almost too impressive. I constantly find myself paying attention to the level designs and not the race. The best new control feature is the drift boosts. It is so incredibly satisfying to pull off a turbo drift. I have no complaints and the only common criticism I've heard is the loading screens are too long. However, they are still shorter than the original game and it's not that big of a deal to wait 20 seconds between races. Pet your animal, stretch, grab a handful of chips or just contemplate the meaning of existence during this time and you'll be fine.",5,2,0,240,1005,23,337,16,6,72.82,6.83,6.85,9.83

"This should really be a 4.5 star review, but a few things kept me from rounding up. Hopefully, updates will address these few flaws. CTR is a wonderful remake/ reboot that falls into both categories, grabbing maps & characters from the entire series. Even if you never played the originals, this is probably the best Kart racer in all of the PlayStation's history (I'd put ModNation from PS3 right alongside it) and certainly the closest you'll get to the King of Karting, in Mario Kart. If you're familiar at all with Kart racing- race with zany characters on courses just as crazy while picking up power-ups that either give you an advantage or rain on opponents' parades, you know what to expect. Some thinga that set it apart include a ton of different costumes for characters, often going beyond clothing to complete reskins (Skunk Bandicoot!) As well as cosmetics for the vehicles- paint jobs, new tires, even entirely new bodies. Which brings us to the first issue: while nothing costs real money, roughly 70% of all items get unlocked via in-game currency, and the payouts are BEYOND weak. Often, you're talking about a race earning double digits in rewards (no coin pickups on the tracks themselves,) at around 60 coins for a win (depending on several factors,) with unlocks often costing in the thousands. The second, and perhaps the biggest drawback are the controls, with only two schemes on offer (no personal remapping,) and neither utilize controls that have been the standard since the end of PS2 era for any racing games. The standby R2= accelerate/ L2= brake/ reverse is nowhere to be found, outside of one scheme that allows R2 usage. Brake & reverse? No, not only is it never mapped as L2, they're two entirely separate entities, with brake always assigned as square, and reverse always, for some unknown reason, set to the D-Pad. As an adult, it's hard enough rewiring my brain after 2 1/2 generations of consoles for this bizarre scheme, but what's more infuriating is that with CTR's family-friendly (and 4 person couch racing! Yay!) Is that it presents an even bigger hurdle of frustration for younger players (I have a 6y/o that LOVES racing games,) to the point of surrender in the early goings. This may be based on 'nostalgia,' as the original CTR debuted on PS1, and the early controller didn't feature thumbsticks, but there's a reason racing games have universally adopted 'trigger' gas & brakes... it's better and more intuitive. Lastly, you may have read about lengthy load times in professional review sites. Perhaps it was updated some prior to my purchase, because while they are a bit longer than you'd expect, they aren't atrociously long. All of these things are relatively low-maintenance issues that hopefully, Beenox will address in future updates. If not, it would be a shame, but nothing worth discarding a purchase over. The biggest issue, the controls, can be adapted to after playing some races, while the skins have two advantages in that you're not being forced to shell out actual cash, despite CTR coming in at a budget price; and nothing in the skin shop 'leaves'. It resets every 24 hours, but per Beenox, it's only a rotation of items. You'll never lose out on an item by not having enough coins, you'll either need to wait until your desired item returns, OR, If you own everything in that category, your final item will remain and not be rotated out while you gather up the necessary currency. Overall, a very fun game that's perfect for family nights or for when the younger ones have friends over, as long as you give it a bit of patience, both for the controls and for earning goodies.",4,1,0,651,2880,70,976,27,12,55.53,11.5,8.99,13.95

Their isnt much variety with the power ups, drifting doesnt feel natural (yet is critical to use), and when I win a race it feels like its more out of luck than due to skill.

If you don't care much for completing a mission over again, you will finish the game very quickly. However, if you explore every option to complete each mission, you can find yourself playing this game for a very long time. Not to mention, there are also an endless amount of other missions created by other players.

"I loved Nioh 1 and thought the game did an outstanding job expanding upon the foundation of Soulborne. Having multiple stances is refreshing. But one underlying issue was the artificial difficulty that pitted you against unrelentless bosses. We play these games because of the challenge, but Team Ninja thinks challenge means unfair difficulty. I still solo'd the game. Nioh 2 though takes extreme difficulty to another level of absurdity. Not only are bosses resistant to fatigue, they spam every move they have within seconds of one another. And Nioh 2 introduces the Dark Realm where the entire area/arena slows stamina regeneration. The game handicaps you for half its run time in the Dark realm. And if anyone know what Yokai realms are, enemies seem to drop them more than I remember in the first game, and they occupy the dark realm as well. Outside of the difficulty issues, the level design is much better than the first, more enemies variety, flawless gameplay, and content for days. The story is still a convoluted mess told in cool '10 second' cutscenes a piece it feels. Team Ninja still did not fix the inventory and loot management system. Selling, dismantling, and sacrificing unused gear/weapons is a chore upon itself. Honestly if you are a newcomer, this game is very confusing especially with the new yokai abilities. I beat the first and still find this game to be information overload. Skills trees, excessive loot and accompanying stats, lore illustrations, stances, etc. It is a lot to take in, yokai burst/abilities. At this point I'm level 76 and feel comfortable with everything, but it is overwhelming in the beginning. This will not be enjoyed by casuals by the slightest. I like the challenge so bring it on, but for Nioh veterans complaining the dlc was an unfair mess...you will find Team Ninja just doesn't understand why people like these games. Unfair difficulty is not it bro!!! I. have a love/hate relationship with Nioh 2.",2,2,1,337,1576,56,526,25,8,61.11,8.09,9.5,12.04

"Yeah you read the title right, all of the games are on the cart, that's impressive for Capcom considering the original and X series games required to download the other half of the collection. Which, is annoying since one reason you're probably buying physical is to not eat up all the space on the microSD card. This is a really solid collection, 4GBA games, 2 DS games and a ton of art, music and so on. This is honestly the definitive way to play this series, this extends to the other console releases, let me explain why. the GBA games are accurately depicted and are very fun titles- but the Zero games are very, very hard. The collection adds in 2 OPTIONAL modes, a checkpoint mode which allows you to start from a tagged check point like most other platfromers and casual mode. I can't comment on casual but checkpoint mode is VERY helpful. You spawn at the last checkpoint and have full HP and you don't lose a life. Say what you will about making the game easier, I don't find Zero 1's live system very fair otherwise. If you don't want to use these systems, you can entirely turn them off. I played the Megaman X games a lot and found them fun (well, 1,2,4, at least), these games do seem to ramp the difficulty up a bunch. ZX series is where the collection really shines in terms of being improved via this collection. The second screen is represented through a few different display options and is operate-able via the right analog stick. This lets you select moves on the fly or customize some skills. What makes the ZX games BEST here is, they used the original high res videos from back then as well as better voice samples. So the presentation is vastly improved vs the original DS which only sported a 192p screen. The ZX games also come with the checkpoint & casual mode. The controls are fully customizable in the options screen, but you have to do it in each, game. So hit start, then R then select what you want the controls to be. The GBA games are hard, but with the checkpoint system they're far less nasty and I think most can handle it now. They're great games that should be given a look, it was really apparent that the dev team enjoyed what they were making here and they made the game really stand out with nice visuals & utilizing the full effects of the GBA and later the DS. The only thing I can really complain about is, I wish they re-worked the games, like SEGA did with Sonic CD adding in wide screen. Because of the game's original hardware's low res, there's a bit of screen crunch that can make for some cheap deaths if you're not cautious.",5,1,0,493,2035,44,678,23,9,68.73,9,7.09,12.14

Improving your farm is enjoyable. Fishing and raising your animals is rewarding, too, though I had to look up how to do it, as the game doesn't explain itself very well. Cave spelunking is a little more action-oriented, for days when you're in the mood for that kind of thing. So it was time well spent, but I found myself putting it down after a few seasons. There was not enough direction for me; I felt as though I was passing the time rather than playing a game. Pleasant enough, but I'd rather just read a book.

"Yes, it's very similar to the original Left 4 Dead, and yes, the game-play is pretty much the same, but how much can you vary the sequel to a zombie game? Left 4 Dead 2 = Shoot the super-fast cross-country running zombies before they nom at your brain. With 4 hilariously stereotypical characters, a load of guns and melee weapons, and very creative maps. After you play through the game yourself, this is probably best if you have at least 1-3 other friends that own it. It's a great game to play with friends, because the replay value stays quite high with the amount of variety the AI director throws your way. Plus, it's a nice game to see which of your friends crack under the pressure of a zombie apocalypse. Go buy it. Make sure to grab your samurai sword and plenty of bullets, you'll need them.",5,12,1,155,629,11,209,8,8,73.1,7.88,6.53,10.59
"Listen, guys. You, a few buddies, and a zombie apocalypse. What more needs to be said, eh? But seriously, with a fully-loaded arsenal of zombie slaying equipment and a few friends to help you smash skulls, you will be racing to catch your breath, running from safehouse to safehouse, and narrowly avoiding your own demise (hope you grabbed that med-pack...) until you somehow manage to escape the horde at the very last minute with but a few last headshots and a pipe bomb or two. Of course, if you'd rather just pummel your zombified opponents to the grave (again?), there is always the melee option (and one I'd strongly recommend - especially taking the ol' golf club to a few 'baddies' like you're Tiger Woods or sumpthin'). Just watch out for Tanks! And WITCHES! Please, PLEASE don't disturb the witches! Unless you've got a death wish - or a buddy that's quick to lay down some heavy fire on your behalf. Otherwise, they'll dedicate the episode to you - our fallen survivor...",5,10,0,178,761,15,250,12,7,72.96,6.77,7.34,9.3
"Very fun game. If you have played the original, the basic concept is the same: You start in a safe room with 3 other survivors and basic weapons, and try to make it to the safe room at the end of the level, pciking up more powerful weapons along the way. There are the basic zombies, which will come at you en mass, and then there are the special zombies. Special zombies have niche roles, all of which are aimed at either doing massive damage, or dragging you away from the group to kill you. While one person can kill endless amounts of basic zombies, special zombies often require teamwork to kill, so the players that runs ahead or falls behind the group will often die first. This means that teamwork and sticking together become a neccessity to beat the levels. The game starts off with 4 environments, in which there are 4 or 5 levels for each. The game itself is not that long and can easily be beaten in less than a day, but it is the replayability that makes the game so much fun. Since the number of zombies that spawn and their spawning location are always random, each level is a different experience each time you play. In addition, you can also play multiplayer mode, where the special zombies are actually other players trying to prevent you from finishing the level. As stated previously, this game is especially fun for the multiplayer experience and the replayability, if you do not have xbox live, and no one to play with locally, you might want to grab another title such as Dead Rising 2.",4,10,2,276,1205,22,393,11,12,60.9,11,8.69,13.22

Off hand, I'm not sure I can think of one other than Left 4 Dead (1 and 2). I won't go on and on talking about the game itself (game review mags and websites can do a much better job than myself) but I will summarize by saying it is the ultimate online co-op experience. It is endlessly re-playable and years later the developer continues to provide new downloadable content to keep the experience fresh.

They thought oh let's change the characters, setting, added some weapons and some new zombies it will be good. This feels very familiar with the first installment with minor changes and that's undeniable. You can probably get more value if you play more online. The overall stlye of the game and yes even engine seems to be the same as the 1st one. With Modern Warfare 2, Uncharted 2 etc. out - it will be difficult for this game to find a good niche in the market.

"This game isn't for everyone. The 'mature' rating is quite appropriate with the level of carnage and graphic detail that goes into killing zombies. Everything from chopping off heads with machetes, attracting hoards with pipe bombs, and yes, using a chain saw to cut the zombies in two. Needless to say, I loved it. It was challenging and intense as a video game should be. Sometimes it became less fun as it became extremely difficult, but don't let that shy you away from the game. There are several different modes of play. Offline you can only play with 2 players per console which is a bummer. Online campaign mode however allows you to play with 4 persons under the main characters Nick, Coach, Rochelle, and Ellis. Valve did a great job on many elements of the game. Notably is the way the infected take damage. There are over 40 different ways the zombies can take damage, and each weapon has some special damage abilities. Valve also managed to lace in some humor to the game which provides some comedic relief to the chaos. Ellis has inappropriate stories which no one wants to hear, and well the sound of hitting zombies with a frying pan or guitar never gets old. Besides the campaign mode, there are several more online modes where you can play as the infected or humans which provide for even more fun game play. The best seems to be scavenge. This round based game has you take turns between the infected and humans. Humans score points by filling a generator with gas from gas cans scattered around the map. The infected try to keep the point total low. Who ever wins the most rounds claim the bragging rights. Overall, I would highly recommend this game. Valve tends to make great games (Orange Box anyone?) and this one is no exeption.",4,2,0,314,1401,31,449,23,7,72.01,6.61,8.27,9.41
"No doubt this game makes a fantastic sequel to the original zombie thriller. It is a blast! Fight your way through 5 campaigns now that all link together. Fight new, dangerous zombies on your quest to freedom and rescue, all the while using new melee weapons and guns to meet your goal. While this game provides hours of entertainment, for those who were bored easily from the game play of L4D1, be prepared to be bored again. The repay quality is high, but as play will dictate, it is more of the same old Left 4 Dead with new weapons and fighters. I love the game, and it keeps my attention, but don't be prepared to spend hours upon hours playing. This game is good in small doses.",5,2,0,129,540,8,168,8,7,80.29,6.07,6.98,8.93

New setting 7. New infected 8. New explosives 9. L4D1 infected are going to be in L4D2 10.

"This game has only one flaw so i will get that out of the way immediatly in my opinion it doesnt have very good replay value one you beat the game in as many ways possible its not very tempting to pick it back up, often. And i was not impressed with the online play. Although i am extremely happy that they added the online play because it does offer up alot of enjoyment. I like the fact that the game is fast paced and slow at times but it is a great blend of both, and there are some diverse enemies in this game, its not just hoards of zombies. Each of the special enemies have their own unique ways of attacking and killing them affectively can be tricky. this game is very fun and very challenging",5,6,5,138,558,10,186,6,10,69.46,9.28,6.69,12.1

"A great improvement over the first installment of this franchise. I got bored and sold off L4D1 in several months, but already I can tell that I'll be keeping this one in my library as my go to multiplayer game for a while. The inclusion of 5 campaigns, versus mode on all, survival and now scavenger make this a great purchase. They also upped the gore, and the added melee weapons are a blast to play with. The only drawback is that the overall graphics are not much improved from the first, maybe higher resolution. It seems too bad that with all of the awesome graphics in games these days that Valve seems to be resting on the house that Gordon Freeman built (graphics-wise). But with the frantic gameplay, you'll be more concerned about not getting your a** kicked than how many pixels there are on the screen.",4,1,0,151,649,12,207,7,10,68.97,9,8.1,11.81

"L4D 2 adds some much-needed excitement over the first installment, forcing you to advance or be overwhelmed by waves of zombies. New classes of 'special infected' add much-needed variety to encounters. Unfortunately, the AI-controlled 'bot' characters make certain scenes nearly impossible to complete when playing a 2-player game locally, as they tend to be less helpful than those found in the first L4D game. Simply put, they'll stand next to you and not help at all in many instances when the action gets intense. You're going to need help via Xbox Live to succeed if you wish to use split-screen co-op.",5,1,0,109,486,11,157,5,11,62.85,9.91,9.06,12.76

I usually only play single-player, though the game was designed for co-op play and I hear that's where the game really shines. Still, they took the gore and frenetic violence of the original and upped it a notch. There are some great storyline locations that are very scary, an amusement park, a swamp, etc. The addition of melee weapons is fantastic.",5,1,0,94,383,10,130,6,6,73.93,6.84,6.27,10.52

"Well worth the price. I pre-ordered the game a few days before it came out. I dont know what there is to complain about, very good product. I dont know what people are talking about when they say you have limited ammo for your pistols? It's all unlimited, the double pistols, and the desert eagle. If you don't want to use those you can use a guitar, machete, sword, police stick, cricket bat, or even a chainsaw. You have the ability to switch between pistols and melee weapons so don't listen to people who say you run out of ammo with your pistols because they have the choice to switch back and forth between weapons. The graphics are fine, much more blood and gore than the first game. I play it as much as COD: MW2 lol and that's ALOT.

Either way a good strategy game for the teamwork savvy individual and a refreshing update for loyal fans of the first game. although some might claim its easier to in as infected or maybe even survivors its really quite balanced in my opinion and with new modes other than simply campaign or verses it retains its entertainment time for quite a while. Not only will old fans love it but its easy to learn and jump into the game for first timers, all in all a good buy for those with trigger happy fingers.",5,1,0,129,580,15,192,4,16,48.18,14.55,9.72,17.55

"This game is a very fun survival game. In most modes players must defend themselves as they travel in a group of four to the safe houses. When playing online, it is fun to switch off being survivors and play as infected. I found it that this game is best when playing online with friends. One of the best parts of the game is the new weapons and items. Also, melee weapons are fun to use. There is a new mode called scavenge where you have to collect gas cans and whoever gets the most wins-but you have to do it while the other team attacks. The variety in the game makes it worth coming back to. The achievements are also fun and challenging to obtain. The only bad thing is probably just some glitches, usually when online, but it really doesnt make much of a difference. All in all, this is a really fun game.

I decided I would get it around christmas time. I saw that best buy had this game at $35 dollars (around thanksgiving) and I couldn't turn down this game for that price and I am happy that I didn't. The game is a huge upgrade from the first. The graphics are leagues ahead of the first game. There are several new modes, including a round based multiplayer over xbox lto go along with the versus mode. More guns and a longer much harder campain make this game worth the $60 you'll pay for it, if you find it for cheaper then that, buy it for sure.",5,1,0,148,556,6,181,8,6,84.59,6.06,4.69,9.02
"Throw on your gear, grab your weapons, and stretch your muscles! The zombies are here and its up to you and your partners to stop 'em! As soon as this game starts your dropped in the middle of chaos. And, as you might have guessed, its an infinite amount of zombies constructing the chaos. Which leaves you only one option, blast your way through the town. But don't fret! You've got 3 partners to help you along the way, which you'll need against your fast-paced enemies. In single campaign, your partners can slow you down a bit, but in the online multiplayer, its a free-for-all shooting session. Please understand, online gaming is what games like this is made for. I've owned a XBox for a fairly short amount of time, but this game is at the top of my list as far as XBox games. I love the graphics, the sounds, the gameplay, and the setting. If ya dig apocalypse style games/movies like I do, definitely pick this game up. Highly highly recommended. *I've heard some people say that this game is just like the first Left 4 Dead. I can't vouch for that, but if you're a first time L4D'er (like me), don't hesitate in buying this game. Happy hunting!",5,1,0,224,894,10,281,16,5,86.5,4.67,5.55,7.39

The reactions from the zombies when you attack them seem very realistic, the campaign levels are very unique, creative and fun, and there are more types of zombies than in the first one. The new weapons and game modes added are also awesome. When I saw that this was on sale for $35, I couldnt pass it up, and I'm glad that I picked it up. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A SIMPLE, FUN, AND WELL CRAFTED GAME(with the thought that it involves a lot of violence and zombie killing, so if your sensitive to the kind of stuff, its not exactly the game for you)",5,1,0,150,579,10,194,6,10,72.04,9.42,5.71,12.67

The new melee weapons as well as better guns make this game more enjoyable and the new zombies such as the 'jockey' are great. Online modes, as in the first LFD, are great as well.

"If you liked the first one, you will love this one! The campaigns are longer and there are more challenges. There are also more weapons and more campaigns than the first one!",5,1,1,32,139,1,40,3,5,90.26,3.32,6.97,5.52
"The scenarios are a lot bigger and there are objectives to complete in each level, rather than just get from A-B. It is harder to beat than the first one because of the new Zombies and the fact that you must turn off alarms physically- they will not turn off on their own. However, it is a great upgrade from number 1 and a really awesome game to buy; I highly recommend it.",5,1,1,74,294,6,100,3,10,67.47,9.98,6.36,13.11

"I think the game will be great but i know people who are not going to buy it because they think it will not be much different from the first installment. I say, why not get it. If you liked the first game, this is more left 4 dead excitement. Can't wait for the new infected and weapons. Versus and Realism mode are going to be great. I love playing L4D with 3 of my great friends.",5,1,1,78,296,5,96,6,3,89.52,4,4.24,7.76
"Just played the demo for l4d2. Controlls are similar but doesn't seem as responsive. The controls seemed slugish compared to the 1st one. Graphics are amazing and the different normal zombies are great. Seemed like there are too many swarms of zombies which i can see as being a problem in versus. Ai is still dumbed down. Expert is impossible unless you have 4 great players because you can no longer wait hordes out thanks to new special infected like spitters. Also, the melee weapons are just stupid. The melee weapons replace your pistols, so when you run out of ammo you have to use a frying pan or a bat. Don't even waste your time with the melee weapons what would you rather have 2 handguns or a guitar to fight endless hordes of zombies? Overall the game should be great apart from the few gripes i posted. If you liked the 1st one youll like this.",5,1,1,160,685,7,219,12,6,77.51,5.76,7.15,7.08

No stress its just you and the completion.",5,2,1,65,246,3,79,4,5,87.52,5.09,4.63,8.35
"Its a pretty good game, especially for $40, but the Switch version seems pretty poorly optimized. It looks like its running below 1080p and dips below 30fps aren't super rare. The game has about a dozen different types of paint you can use on the cars but I can't tell the difference between most of them because the textures are so blurry. The game also uses a lot of motion blur with certain effects, which combined with FPS drops make me feel a little icky. It looks OK enough in handheld mode but is especially bad on the TV. If you mainly want this as a handheld game, I'd recommend it. But if you were planning on spending a greater amount of time on the TV I would recommend getting the game for a different system. 6.5 out of 10, would spend 2 hours racing with Coolmom85 again",3,1,0,152,621,9,208,9,7,73.92,7.14,6.47,9.12

"Weve only had this a day so far, but here are some initial impressions. This is a bit more challenging out of the gate than Mario Kart, so if youre getting it for really little ones, you may want to wait. After day one, it doesnt seem quite as polished as Sonic Racing Transformed which is kind of a bummer because that was a blast. Dont get the wrong idea, this isnt a bad game by any means. The racing is fun, and the team racing aspect is a nice twist. The visuals are colorful and all of your favorite Sonic characters are represented well. A must have if you have a Sonic fan in your house!",4,1,0,117,466,10,158,7,6,75.62,6.86,5.85,10.1
"An entire Sonic themed racing game done really well! I love this game and it is so much fun for people who have already played Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U and Switch and really need a new racing world to immerse themselves in! The race tracks looks amazing! Graphics are wonderfully done and a lot is going on in each track from jumping whales to huge waterfalls and flashy lights. The mechanics are overall really well done and for the price I highly recommend this game. Also and amazing addition is that the Sonic characters talk to each other while racing so youll hear comments throughout the race either bashing praising the characters racing each other! It makes you feel like theyre much more alive. Only critique I have is that for two of the cups, two race tracks are repeated twice. Wish theyd just come up with two new tracks instead of just recycle two of them twice.",4,0,1,161,708,16,226,9,9,69.92,7.95,8.4,11.13

The Limited Run physical release comes with a small ~30 page Instruction Guide/Artbook as well as the full game and Chapter 9: Farewell DLC on the cartridge.

I immediately fell in love with this game because of how fun it was and beat it it about 11 days time. This game is now one of my favorites and I look forward to playing it a second time. The only thing I personally think was bad was that in order to access the final stage you need to collect four hearts which you get by completing b-sides and I had no clue the hearts existed until the end of the game and while a small hiccup I still must remove a star for it.",4,0,1,115,444,7,150,5,9,73.14,8.77,5.61,11.63
"Mega Man 11 is a great addition to the main-line Mega Man series. So much of the gamefrom the graphics, to the controls, to the enemies, to the level designfeels reminiscent of classic Mega Man, but informed by advances in game design in the decades since then. Mega Man still has his basic run, jump, and shoot gameplay, and the levels do a lot to test what you can do with that move set. You don't have to use the Robot Master powers you unlock, or the new Double Gear system, but most of the Robot Master powers are actually useful throughout other levels, and where I initially thought the Gears would be a fallback, like a temporary easy mode, the levels actually feel designed with their use in mind. Certain parts of classic games do feel a little bit outdated in 2018, such as needing to replay much or all of a level if you die (depending on your difficulty setting), or the lives system, but the ability to buy lives in the in-game shop (with in-game bolts, no real money) make it somewhat a non-issue. And if you are the sort of gamer who is so inclined, it can be fun to keep trying parts of levels until you are able to make it through without taking damage; if you are not, you can also buy extra E-tanks in the shop. MM11 definitely plays it safer than you could argue it needed to, but with such a long wait since MM10, and the missteps with Mighty No. 9, I will take the smaller game since the team at Capcom clearly put in the effort to get things right, and I look forward to them building on this in MM12.",4,2,0,297,1194,17,403,8,17,54.36,14.9,7.04,17.14
"It's been quite some years since we've seen a Mega Man title done with love. This right here is a return to form Without losing any of the elements the series is known for.

"The Blue Bomber has long been a nolstalgic figure for me. Mega Man 11 feels exactly like those classic titles that I played on Nintendo tight, precise jump controls, a slide to get you out of trouble and around obstacles and a simple basic weapon the Mega Buster which can be fired rapidly or charged for extra damage. Anyone who has ever played a Mega Man game will feel right at home, and anyone who hasnt will quickly. The Mega Man games have always been challenging and this is no different, but the new setting available for newcomers makes it enjoyable. Mega Man 11 has a reliable base that has been the foundation for so many classic titles. Fans of the series are going to be spoiled like I was with the new challenges. We may live in a new golden age of hardcore platformers, but Capcoms blue hero has shown all these newcomers that class never fades. Not only a game that sits alongside the best Mega Man games, but one of the best platform games released in recent memory. Thank you Capcom.",5,1,0,184,803,20,267,9,10,63.32,9.51,8.41,12.53

"This is a great remake, the controls are a bit clumsy and it seems a bit easier. But I don't think that's a bad thing. The original game was never very challenging, so I don't think that's the point. Treasure sticking around on the ground longer definitely helps you collect everything and be a little less strategic when picking things up. Which I always thought was just an annoyance. The motion controls do help with aiming kinda similar to Breath of the Wild when Link uses his bow. Because of the placement of the second analog on the New 3DS I find my fingers attempting some strange stretches, but it is very doable. Over all a great game and worth buying if you liked it the first time through or you missed out on the GameCube version.",4,3,0,141,593,12,195,8,8,71.95,7.6,7.25,10.45

"Luigis Mansion proves that theres still life in the 3DS, even as the Switch seems positioned to become its replacement. This version is so much more than a look at a title from that past. Were getting to play a lost piece of Nintendos history; a game that was originally designed for 3D, but was never fully realised due to the limitations of the technology at the time. After nearly two decades, we're playing Luigi's Mansion as it was originally intended, and it is as fun now as it was when the GameCube launched. If youve never played it before, you should definitely pick up this version. If you already have, the added functionality in the 3DS port provides more than enough reason to pick up the Poltergust one more time, although if you're one of those people who found the 2001 original disappointingly shallow (yes, such people actually exist), then this update is unlikely to change your mind, even with the welcome introduction of 3D support.

"Back in the day when GameCube was Nintendo's hot new console. Luigi's Mansion was the game that made me run out and buy the console. The idea that Luigi was starring in his own game without hia big brother Mario and as a inside joke/nod to Ghostbusters (one of the greatest movies of the 80's) blew my mind. I loved that game so much and when Nintendo announced they were bringing it back I had to get it. I was slightly disappointed they decided to release it on the 3ds over the switch there new hot selling console. But I'm just glad it's back with new features and upgrades. The fact this game can fit on the 3ds is a testament to just how powerful that little handheld is. If you never played it before you will love it. And if you have then you don't need me to tell you why it deserves to be on your 3ds so get out there and bust some ghosts Luigi style.",5,1,0,176,675,12,228,9,7,77.39,7.32,5.24,10.55
"Nintendo is trying very hard to keep the 3ds alive and make as many sales on it as possible including this title. I had this on the game cube and enjoyed it.

With that being said, it's nice to have this title again for on the go, but an emulation of the original game looks and feels better",4,3,2,81,331,7,113,4,8,68.26,8.77,6.77,11.56

"Overall a very good port from originally a 360/PS3 game. If this is your first tales game, it's a good start as it's known as one of the best in the series alongside Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube. Incredible graphics for on the go and a likeable cast which is the most important part in any Tales of game. Standard Tales battle system which makes for a good action RPG. The only downside in this game on the switch is some frame rate drops when on the world map. Battles and towns are very smooth and for a game you can take with you anywhere, it's impressive to say the least. Dock mode eliminates most of the drops so if you're planning on staying home to play, you won't have to worry about any of that. One thing for people that have played this in the past, Bandai has added some new voiced lines for the English dub. It is a bit awkward as they never got Troy Baker to come back and voice these additions so they found someone that sounds similar. It's supposed to be bit awkward according to others but I personally haven't noticed it as of yet or I just haven't reached a point where it's apparent. Whether you are new to Tales or replaying, this port is awesome and hopefully it shows the interest of JRPGs from the Nintendo Switch crowd.",5,9,1,247,990,21,335,11,9,69.3,9.17,6.45,12.38
"Tales of Vesperia is one of my favorite games, almost strictly for its game play and art style. The story and music are a bit lackluster, but the 9 different characters this game offers, each with a unique play style, more than make up for them. If you want a really fun (single player or co-op) action JRPG, this is it. However, this port is not as good as it should be, despite what others may tell you. The most glaring problem is that, despite Namco claiming the Switch version would run 30 fps outside of battle and 60 fps inside of battle, outside of battle instead runs at an unlocked frame rate. This means that in towns, dungeons, and on the world map, the fps will constantly rise and drop, making for a very jittery experience. Also, consistent 60 fps in battle is not a thing. It is certainly smoother than field areas, but if Rita (the spell caster in the game) casts even a mildly flashy spell, expect drops. Also, if you do what is called an Encounter Link (which is running into 2 enemies on the field at once, making for around 6-10 enemies in the actual battle), expect constant frame drops to around 50 fps. People all over claim the battles are a constant 60 fps, and unfortunately that is just not true. The PS3 version ran far better in this regard. And while that was at a lower resolution than this port (PS3: 1280x576 vs Switch Handheld: 1280x720), it is mind boggling that a constant 60 fps cannot be maintained in battle. The unique issue with this Switch port is the washed out color palette. For some reason, the colors are nowhere near as vibrant as they should be. The PS4 version shares some of the same frame rate issues, though they are not as severe, but it certainly does not have washed out colors. For a game that thrives on its art style, this is a huge disappointment. I really can't recommend this port. It feels like a poorly optimized rush job by Namco. As my base PS4 also has mind boggling frame drops, I really could only recommend trying out the PS4 Pro, Xbox One X, or PC versions, though I haven't played those ones so I can't vouch for their performance.",3,3,0,394,1653,26,537,19,9,70.48,8.58,7.44,10.93
"I enjoyed what I've played of this game so far. The problem is, my girlfriend did not. I've been desperately looking for something we can both play together, and this caught my eye for it's ability to have multiplayer. The problem is, it falls flat on it's face with absolutely no explanation on how it works. Granted we figured it out in a few minutes of online searching, but still, it should be more apparent. During battles, the camera follows just the primary character. If other characters fall out of frame... oh well. Even if it wasn't multiplayer, the camera should pan out and pan to include all players and NPCs in frame. She couldn't see her character, or what she was doing, meanwhile I was getting ganged up on, and eventually died, along with our interest in playing this in multiplayer mode. That being said, as a single player game, it holds quite a bit of my interest. It plays something similar to Ni No Kuni and Lightning Returns (FF13-3), leaning much close to Ni No Kuni minus the familiars(think pokemon) stuff. The story seems fun, and the battle system is relatively straight forward. For the price I paid I would highly recommend it for someone looking for a color RPG. I haven't run into the voice acting issue others have mentioned, but I can be pretty obvious to that stuff, as it matters little to me for games I'm not super vested in.",4,1,0,255,1074,26,367,15,7,67.82,8.02,7.22,10.88

It is also fantastic to have this portable! One thing to note, there are two voice actors for every character if you choose English as a language.

Its considered by most Tales of fans to be one of the best entries in the series, and at about 20 hours in a of playing, Id agree so far! While it shows its age in some aspects (camera mainly, but some graphical parts), its a solid game that overall has held up nicely over the years. It works fine in handheld version too, and havent noticed any dips in the 60 FPS for combat, & 30 FPS while not in combat. The load times are quick between battles & new locations, few seconds at most. The battle system is solid, & allows for players to make it as simple or complex as wanted. The voice work (both ENG & JP) is great with strong performances. So far the characters are all very likeable & seem to have depth to them.

"I have played many games in the Tales series and I was excited to try this one out after hearing that it's considered 'one of the best,' but my experience with it so far has been a mixed bag. I find the story and some of the characters just interesting enough to be compelled to keep playing, but the battle system is frustrating enough at times to make me consider selling it. The battle system is not as convoluted as some of the later entries in the series, but some battles, particularly boss battles can be infuriating. This game is not a button masher so you can't expect to just waltz into battle and bash everything into oblivion. It does take some strategy and quick reflexes to dodge/block enemy attacks as well as good timing to chain combos together. However, despite knowing this, there are still things that make me want to pull my hair out: 1. Your attacks miss semi-frequently even when you're using the control stick to aim your attacks. 2. Despite my efforts to roam around and strategically avoid enemy attacks, it feels like the character I'm controlling has a target on his head and most of the enemies seem to gang up on me and disrupt my attacks/combos. Blocking doesn't seem to do much when you're surrounded by multiple enemies because they will just tag-team your butt as soon as you stop blocking. 3. There are huge spikes in the difficulty level with many bosses. The only way I've been able to get past many of them is by setting the game to 'easy' mode. 4. Some of the characters are really slow in battle. They move slow, their attacks are slow and they are slow to get up when knocked down. 5. Skills. You earn lots of skills and you have to equip your skills using your skill points in order to use them. The problem I have is that you earn very few skill points (at least early on) and there are many skills I'm not using because they require a lot of skill points, thus limiting my options to use other skills. It seems like this could have been balanced better. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're a die-hard fan of the Tales games, you like a challenge, or you can get paste the things that have frustrated me.",2,2,12,412,1705,32,564,22,8,72.02,7.87,6.95,10.6
"This game is good but could have been better if they didnt be lazy and ported over the cell phone version because in tv mode you use only a single joycon as a mouse on your tv screen, but portable mode is where it shines but like I said before its because it was a lazy port from a cell phone version but all in all still a fun game but only in portable mode",3,2,0,75,283,2,94,1,34,24.68,28.45,5.99,31.07
"I had played this game briefly on the Nintendo DS, and played it fully through when it was released on IOS on my iPad. This is a direct port of the IOS release, and looks and sounds great. The story is still compelling years later, and the constructs between character interaction, combat structure, and RPG mechanics all work great. What doesnt work great are the controls. There are two methods of control, one which uses a point cursor and motion controls to draw the designated shapes to trigger attacks when docked, and one that uses your finger on the screen to do the same when in handheld mode. The latter is the same experience as I had on the IPAD, but feels slightly more cramped on the switch screen. I had been really looking forward to a proper console experience on the tv, but found the point controls both overly sensitive and less effective, which hinders combat and therefore the rewards you obtain. I would love o see them patch in a new control scheme, but think it is unlikely. I would strongly suggest that this is a fantastic game to play but worth renting or borrowing to see if the controls resonate before making the purchase.",4,1,0,207,927,18,294,9,12,63.33,10.14,9.25,12.68

Collecting and leveling up all the pins(weapons) in the game can become a rewarding obsession. This edition is the definitive version. It adds a brand new character.

"Here we have another awesome port for the Switch. This version does have slightly upgraded visuals (not as good as PS4/Xbox but thats to be expected). It also comes with the Artorias of The Abyss DLC. For Dark Souls veterans this is a welcome port as you can play Dark Souls anywhere. For new players this is a great way to get introduced to the Souls series as it is the complete package for Dark Souls. Gameplay wise Blighttown has ZERO frame rate issues whatsoever. The games plays wonderfully on the Switch at a very steady 30fps even in Blighttown. Also the graphics and visuals were much better than anticipated. Online also works well. Servers appear to be pretty stable, and I have noticed little to no lag when playing online with others or when invaded.

You don't want to spoil the whole game so don't go watch an entire Let's Play or read a walkthrough, but the game really explains very little to you. Use a guide to learn a few mechanics and find a few items, then trust that the game has given you all you need to beat that 'unfair' boss. With practice and patience, anything is beatable. Only misses out on 5 stars because of a higher barrier to entry and, mostly, because of the poor audio quality on Switch. You learn to live with it, but the sound should be better.

Visually its an improvement from the x360 version. Its not in 4K running at 60fps, but unless youre looking at a side-by-side, the differences doesnt really take you out of it. Sound quality has been compressed but not enough to dampen my experience. The controls feel fluid and responsive. I have big hands, so Ive been using the pro controller. Using the joy-cons still works just as well. I dont think motion controls have been added. I think the portability aspect is perfect for this game. If you need to grind for souls with the tv on in the background. Or have one more go at the boss before work. Playing undocked still looks just as good, if not better, docked. For newcomers, Dark Souls is a game about patience, risk and reward.

If you're not a hardcore fan of this series, you need a game guide to progress. That said, I do enjoy the time I spend with Dark Souls. The scenery is gorgeous, and I love the lore and ambience.

"This is the glitchiest game Ive ever played. Ive been playing the campaign with my friend across the country as its become a tradition of ours in this series and Ive never experienced so many glitches than I have in this game. For example, when you start upgrading Jack it tells you to go to the Jack menu, so I did but I got stuck in it and the only way to get out of it was to restart to the last checkpoint (as many other people have reported the same problem). When we finally beat the Matriarch, it put me in a loading screen and my friend in a cut scene. He wanted me to see the cut scene, so he reloaded the last checkpoint and it made us replay the Matriarch boss battle! There are also many times where the game will freeze for a second, especially after rolling whilst in combat and when it unfreezes, I get killed. We were playing again the other day and I was driving the skiff and kept getting stuck without being able to drive or get off of it. The only solution was to reload the checkpoint and even then sometimes he had to reload it three times for it to allow me to do anything. I have attached a screenshot of this. All of these glitches are completely unacceptable. As someone who has loved and played this franchise since the get-go I am truly disappointed how they would release this game with so many glitches. Its a shame too because it is visually beautiful and I love the new additions and storyline as well but they were obviously money hungry and didnt care about fixing the bugs before launch. I will not be buying anymore Gears games because they failed on this one because its just too frustrating dealing with all of the glitches, which takes away from the fun of the game.",2,1,4,324,1360,23,447,13,11,64.82,10.41,7.69,12.81

"Man was Turok 2 a huge improvement over the original Turok. I enjoyed the sequel on the n64 and this remastered port improves the game. Again, the game doesn't wow you, but if you remember the old game on the 64, you will be amazed at how it looks without all the fog. The draw distances have been improved tremendously. Also, getting lost when you first started was frustrating, but they have added helpful and optional waypoints if you need them. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because they completely removed multiplayer from the switch version. The Xbox One port has it, but sadly there is no physical copy for that available. Still I loved Turok 2 on the n64 so this took me back and with improvements making this worth playing.

You cannot use another mii account when playing 2 or more. Gameplay has some bugs like items getting stuck or characters disappearing completely. The campaign story is very short, the first game had more stages. You could finish the main game in a weekend. Hopefully the upcoming dlc will fix these issues or add more features.

"Great sequel to its predecessor. Overcooked 2 added new features that improve upon Overcooked. First, players are now able to toss raw ingredients to one another over a significant distance, hastening the ever need to stay ahead of the orders. You can also play with other individuals via internet connection, though I honestly have not used this feature this far. I did however, play this game with my 11 year old niece and she loved it. Also, the overall chaotic nature of the game is entertaining to watch, even if not actively playing. Overcooked 2 is a game that brings together all ages and skill-ranges of individuals. This game is easy enough that one can pick up the controller and quickly learn and enjoy its gameplay, while gradually adapting to the progressive difficulty of new levels.",5,2,0,137,647,25,226,8,10,49.89,10.55,10.24,14.15

The second game is better in just about every way. The production values are much higher and the new mechanics are fun. The only issue is the game was a bit easier, however they recently added more goals to really push the player to work harder, so i guess you could say that's been fixed.

"Because it seems like Ubi changed Breakpoint so much more between their previous titles (inc. what some refer to as a cookie-cut Wildlands, but 'worse'), I'm going to provide an outline of the gameplay and mechanics, rather than a comparison of previous Ubi / Clancy titles. Suffice it to say, I'm a vet Ubi / Clancy player (& Clancy book reader), so I already like the stories, but this review isn't about the story (no spoilers, lol), only the gameplay and mechanics, which will be unbiased, so you can come to your own conclusions about it. I also played the beta, but this isn't a comparative of the beta, nor what they should have added / took away from the final release... only about the current PS4 version of the game (which I believe is 1.02, if I remember correctly). FOREWARD To those who either regret purchasing games like this, or have nothing but complaints about games... (1) There's a reason (beyond final bug testing) many game makers provide an open beta; start making use of this option to form an opinion before you buy the release; and (2) Even with a few bugs ironed out of a beta, new games seldom come out wrinkle-free... if your opinion is based solely on these new-launch wrinkles (every time), then you might as well stop playing games. GAMEPLAY & MECHANICS - A LOT of Gameplay Details I've heard a lot complaints about this game dropping your allies (something that the Ubi / Clancy games aren't know for), but the irony is that I think most people who are complaining about this have never read a single Clancy book. Some of his books involve groups (Rainbow Six) while others do not (Jack Ryan); and Jack has allies that come and go. Breakpoint has struck me as a game which is following the path of 'The Empire Strikes Back', where we're finally seeing the dark side of this world... all alone... heavily out-numbered and out-gunned. Without giving anything (else) away, from what I've seen of the beta and official story, this looks to be a very promising story; if you don't like stories in games and are only playing for the 'hack and slash' or PvP aspect, I don't think this is the title for you. In addition to the immersive story, there is also a gear and character level system (which meshes together to determine your 'combat rank'). Between the loot / gear drops, crafting system (which for an FPS, is quite immersive), collection system, optional non-guided system (e.g. you can disable all mission / objective hints and find things on your own), open world (which isn't as 'open' or wide-spread as Wildlands; making traveling and missions much better), and a classic-feeling (but re-designed) driving / vehicle system, this new title seems to be more overwhelming (in detail and options) that people give it credit for. From a new generation gamer perspective, I can understand the criticism, but as both a VERY old-school gamer and one who has a little experience coding and producing audio, Breakpoint has (so far) proven to be a well thought-out and immersive experience; speaking purely from the perspective of enjoying the gameplay and mechanics (since I haven't had enough time to form a review of the story); and to elaborate on that perspective, it seems like Ubi has taken slices (e.g. mechanics) from Blacklist, GRAW, Far Cry, Wildlands, and systems now specific to Breakpoint to make this game. - Realistic Movements Meaning that when your character stops, it isn't a sudden / instant motion like older games or PvP type action games, rather there is some character swaying and what some might describe as 'clumsy', but is in fact much more realistic (if your only interest is PvP or instant controller / character response, you'd be better off with a different game; how about Fortnite, Modern Warfare, or Black Ops?). These realistic movements extend to being hurt (via limping) and sliding / rolling down the sides of mountains (if you try to run too quickly or run out of stamina). Since the animations are made to simulate an actual movement / action experience, they can seem clumsy, slow, or 'clunky' to some... but I've found that they merely take a little getting used to, and enjoy the experience of how a person would actually reacted in the field. Is it perfect? No. A few of the movements could be ironed out a bit, but beyond that, the movement is everything I'd expect it to be. Thinking back as far as Far Cry 2, Blacklist, and GRAW, (many titles which I still own and have played again to compare to Breakpoint) Ubi seemed to incorporate more focus on 'realistic' movement than other games; where the first title that came to mind in typing this is Blacklist. As time has gone on, it seems like this is a strong focus point for Ubi game titles, so it shouldn't be surprising to see such 'clunky' (lol) movements in Breakpoint. - Detailed TacMap & Menu System If I had a complaint, it'd be that navigating the menu is a bit slow, but given all of the detail provided in the menu, it is understandable why it is so slow (I suppose Ubi could re-code or re-design this a bit in the future to make it a bit snappier though). That being said, there is a LOT of detail in the menu. Among the many menu features, you have an instant drop in / out system, a very nice / detailed map (which is smaller than Wildlands, but as detailed, or more-so, than Far Cry 5), a detailed inventory / gear-level system (VERY much like The Division, if not 'cut' from it), a fairly diverse class / skill tree system (again, like The Division, Destiny, or any other MMO-structured game), an objective board (which takes a bit to get used to navigating), an in-game store (which is like Wildlands and other games, that provides both a rewards / crate system and a non-intrusive microtransaction type system; giving players the option to 'buy' their game progress), and a LOT of in-game settings (on par with the settings one might find for a PC). ***Menu System Hint*** The whole menu is navigated via your left control stick (like a mouse cursor), and I've found that it is MUCH easier (and snappier) to hit the Options button (as opposed to the touchpad) and use the control stick to navigate the menu, instead of using the trigger buttons to switch tabs. - Detailed Graphics More detail to the character (despite complaints over initial character design / customization), the environment (inc. weather effects and lighting), and item textures. The one, odd feature I find is the transitional lighting between indoors and out. While I get the effect they're going for, the result of the lighting 'balance' (we'll call it) is just 'off'. You'll have to play or watch some YT reviews to see what I mean. - Realistic AI Contrary to common complaint, the AI isn't 'dumber', but (I feel) more realistic. Using a simple example, let's say you and I were playing a game of paintball and I took a shot at you from a distance. Now, if I hit you, (without dealing a 'critical shot'), you should be able to get a rough idea of where I shot from by both the sound and where I hit you. If you have nearby allies, they might even see movement or 'gun smoke / flash' (in a realistic scenario) in the direction I shot from. This means that you and your buddies will either carefully head towards the last area you saw me, or take cover from that direction and fire back. If you decide to track me, depending on your RL skills, you may be able to track me from my last location or can guess where I might have relocated to and try there. Regardless of your strategy, you'll have one... and so do the AI (depending on their skill / level).; it's not that their strategy is 'dumb' (at least, not in every instance, lol; and certainly not if you're playing on anything harder than the normal difficulty). In several instances, I've seen the AI react in different ways, depending on how I chose to approach them. Drones and machinery, on the other hand, are a beast. Not only are their movements harder to predict (if not impossible) over human AI, (inc. an erratic-ness about them), but they each have a strength and weakness, each of which you must (or should) figure out for yourself. - Realistic Damage and Combat I've seen a LOT of complaints regarding how a Lv10 character can kill a Lv100+ AI with a single head-shot, but if discovered, that Lv100 becomes a bullet-sponge. Again, let's use a RL example. If you're a lightly-geared soldier going up against something of a 'Juggernaut' caliber (e.g. a VERY heavily armored enemy soldier), you should be able to kill that soldier with a single shot to the head (or, like in Breakpoint, one shot to damage the helmet and one shot to kill), regardless of how much more powerful that soldier is than you; a head-shot is a head-shot. On the other hand, if you tried to bring that soldier down with rounds to his armor, you might be there for a minute... and if that soldier is more skilled than you, it might be only a matter of seconds before you're brought down (lol); regardless of your own gear or tactics. When attempting to hide from hostiles, the enviro-camo is nice, being able to throw dirt, mud, or snow over yourself, and adds a nice 'guerrilla' type tactic to the battlefield. - PvP Gameplay This doesn't strike me as a game designed with PvP in mind, although that type of gameplay IS available. It reminds me of The Division, in that the game mechanics were NOT designed with the snappy control that a PvP'er might be more used to (or prefer), but it does have a tiered reward PvP system like so many PvP games out there have right now. Between the controls, animation, and story, this game should provide a solid experience for any solo or co-op players out there... but for those looking to play this game solely for the PvP experience, I think you might be disappointed... especially if comparing Breakpoint to other popular titles out there. - Requires a Connection to Ubisoft's Servers I've heard that there have been issues with connecting to the Ubi servers; and that it's required to play th",5,3,0,1813,7751,168,2614,68,13,57.8,11.82,8.23,14.37

I haven't experienced bugs as much as some people apparently but it wouldn't matter if I did because even working flawlessly I do not enjoy the game.",2,1,0,76,342,9,113,9,4,72.48,5.25,7.15,8.11

"I purchased the $60 version for the ps4 after playing the open beta a week ago. The amount of bugs in the game is so disappointing. There were fewer bugs in the beta. The three main issues I had: player movement, enemy AI and cutscenes in the first HOUR of gameplay. When you move the left stick up your player's cuts in and out of walking and jogging, same in a crouch. Sometimes when you aim in crouch you stand up for no reason. When you log out and load in, on the ps4, it takes almost 2 minutes for your weapons to load and enemy NPC's to load in. In one cutscene by the lake with the guy and the daughter I had enemy NPCs surround me in the cutscene and then after it ended I was Kia. You guys have the audacity to charge $120 for one of the versions and still do microtransactions for things THAT CAN IMPROVE YOUR WEAPONS there not just cosmetic microtransactions. This game has so much potential but I didn't pay $60 to do your bug testing for you. I'll be posting this review everywhere else because people need to no you put out such an unpolished game. These issue I had didn't even happen in the beta, so I don't know how your game got worse on launch.",1,9,9,232,912,15,305,12,7,75.99,7.46,5.78,10.32

"The reason I purchased this is the Pac-man games, mainly the original Pac-man game, Pac-man was may favorite game back in the 80;s I was able to get to the 6th key which was my best game, after playing the original game on the Switch it's an excellent copy of the arcade version, all the patterns work exactly like they did back in the day, even the hiding place is there. Now Pac-Man Championship version I wasn't sure about at first cause I never played it in the arcade version, but it takes Pac-man to a whole new level, more like Pac-Man on steroids! I fell in love with it after a while it's a the best Pac-Man game I've played and that's from someone that grew up loving the original Pac-Man. For the other games Dig-Dug, Splatter House, Rolling Thunder I & II, Tower of Druaga, Tank Force, Sky Kid, Pac-Man vs. and let us not forget the two Galaga games is just as I remember it for me arcade, I mean the sound and the graphics are the same from the arcade. I did not care for Sky Kid even back in the arcade from the late 80's and during the 90's, I think the one I like the best is Rolling Thunder II you can tell from the artwork from the game that the old pinball machines had an influence on Rolling Thunder II this one held my attention more that the others. Splatter House is my second favorite but a little more difficult than I remember but that's okay I going to really get into this one more, I had this one on my old Sega Genesis and I was so much better cause it gave you unlimited lives. But Let us not forget Pac-Man Championship Edition is clearly the best game in the bunch, this whole bundle of games I really like cause it brings me back to the days that you could go to the arcade and just spend one quarter per game, so I had a great time with a few dollars and could spend a hour just getting away from everything.",5,5,0,378,1439,21,484,8,21,50.55,17.95,5.96,21.12

It's a bit odd to see games like Mappy, Xevious, and the Pole Positions missing, but the assortment here is still good and I imagine Bandai Namco has plans for those in either another compilation or as DLC.

You might want to look up a video before you do. All the charm of the first CE is gone. It isn't easy to tell were you need to go and the maze isn't split with changing sides. You bounce off ghosts until they for a single ghost that can harm you. The bomb no longer gets rid of them and only transports you to the center of the maze. Forget power pellets... You just wait until you get to a maze that will allow you to eat the ghosts and pacman eats the chain the moment you catch just the lead ghost in the chain. There are annoying jump points and some mazes are so riddled with them that it is more annoying than fun. Namco needs to go back the the first CE to see what made it fun.

"JRPGs aren't known for their 'western' visual/audio entertainment budget, so if you're going into this expecting ground-breaking graphics and a whole mind-blowing JRPG experience, you'll be disappointed. However, if you're into JRPGs and you already know what to expect, this will fit the bill like a glove. So you might wonder, then, why I've stated this is the most complete JRPG ever. It's quite simple, really: there are virtually no JRPGs that provide an endgame that encourages you to reach the maximum level. Many JRPGs have a sort of 'plateau' at which point you've become so powerful, you can do whatever you have to. Grinding to lvl 99 or whatnot is just for fun. Not with DQXI it isn't. My advice to you?

"After a handful of spinoff titles and a Japanese-only release for the tenth game, Dragon Quest XI marks the return of the iconic JRPG series after several years since it's ninth installment on the Nintendo DS. You are the Luminary, a hero of prophecy. However, there are those who do no see your presence as beneficial to the world, and thus begins a perilous adventure to fulfill your destiny against mounting odds. Along the way, you'll assemble a party consisting of a reformed thief named Erik, twin sisters Veronica and Serena, and many more. Combat in DQ11 will be somewhat familiar to returning fans, it's still turned-based, but now with the option to freely run around the battleground as you pummel slimes and other beasts. A revamped skill system allows you to customize your party to your liking, favoring preferred skills/weapons over others in order to obtain powers and abilities ahead of others. Much like the eighth installment way back on the PlayStation 2, the game features full voice-acting, giving the game a kind of medieval fair-like vibe.

The atmosphere, the characters, the often silly-looking monsters, many side quests, the easy leveling-up and skill grid, I only stopped playing after 4 hours because I just had to eat.

I put in about 100 hours finishing the story and then going back to complete all sidequests and enjoyed every minute of it.

The grind if you want, blast through if you want style is definitely my jam. The graphics are great and will hold up years down the road. The music is good, if a bit repetitive. Might be a nitpick but I'd love the option to stream other music especially during long grind sessions. The Fun Size Forge mini game is great and way more intuitive than I expected. 30 hours in, the story is pretty much the same as all JRPGs which is both a blessing and a curse. They don't go too crazy, needlessly complicating it, however most of the plot twists have been fairly predictable. The one exception is pretty early on which I'll not give any spoilers to. Overall, it is great to see Square Enix on their A-Game again.",5,2,0,163,654,12,216,11,5,79.69,5.83,5.79,8.87
"One of the best purchases I've made for the PS4, if you are in to jrpgs, you will likely love this game. Good graphics, gameplay, and a lengthy story. A must have!",5,1,0,33,124,2,42,3,2,88,3.72,3.6,6.82
"This is a very high quality JRPG, and has just about everything I would want, but its hard for me to get through this game because of my own bias and I knew this when I started it but I just wanted to give this series a try. I don't like full on mid-evil fantasy settings, so I normally avoid every game that uses this setting but I really wanted more JRPGs to play so I picked it up because it looks so good. Everything from scenery, animations, sound, gameplay, difficulty, contents is excellent, but if there is one thing I don't like besides my own bias its the music.",4,1,0,113,448,11,157,3,17,51.06,15.49,6.73,18.96
"I've been a Dragon Quest, or Dragon Warrior as it was known back then, fan since the first game back on the NES. And while it was never super huge here in the US as it is in Japan, it's still got a cult following. DQ5 was the best the series has been...until now. DQ11 is simply fantastic and a must have JRPG for any fan of the genre. I'll likely pick this up on the Switch as well once it comes out.",5,1,0,87,305,3,104,6,3,90.99,4.17,2.77,7.18
"Currently in my mind based on recent relevant game releases by SquareEnix Dragon Quest has surpassed the Final Fantasy Series. It has stayed with its foundation and is developed from it's strengths. Balanced story and great dynamic animation and you'll enjoy it for hours on end. Being that I'm a big fan of the Final Fantasy series, 15 was decent but seemed unfinished compared to Dragon Quest XI.",5,1,0,71,323,12,109,4,9,58.94,9.45,9.28,13.86
"I used to play JRPGs almost exclusively. I'm not sure, at some point either they started to change, my tastes started to change, or both. I just found myself not enjoying them as much as I used to. Not only did I stick to Dragon Quest XI to the end, I put over 100 hours on it completing post game content. I will have to say, the story was so riddled with tropes that it almost became a parody of itself, but the overall design of the game was great and combat was enjoyable (if not a little too easy). If you remember the golden era of JRPGs (SNES and Playstation era), you'll find a lot to like here. Recommended.",4,1,0,122,477,9,164,7,6,75.42,7.07,5.49,9.92

"I was skeptical about this game at first because jrpgs in recent years haven't been as great. Dragon quest XI is a very traditional style jrpg that does everything right. It's an excellent throwback to the golden years of the genre with a top notch turn based battle system. My only complaint would be the sometimes cringy voice acting, but it's easy to overlook when everything else is of such high quality. Much better game than FFXV as well.",5,1,0,82,357,7,115,5,8,71.54,7.35,7.99,9.97

"I've always wanted to get into the Dragon Quest series, but never found myself diving into the games--that is, until the 11th installment of Dragon Quest came out. I'm immediately thrown into a new yet familiar looking world thanks to artist Akira Toriyama--famed illustrator of the Dragon Ball series. There's quite of lot of places to see and new characters to meet. Gameplay-wise, it's a very traditional turn based JRPG. Random encounters are a thing of the past! While in the overworld, I can run, ride, and helm my way around an area all without getting into a monster battle. However, when I do find myself in encounters, it's all familiar territory--some battles even providing a good challenge. The dialogue can be a bit cheesy and the accents seem to tire after a while, but it's charming. Can't wait to play more!",5,1,0,153,651,18,232,9,8,61.3,8.93,7.48,11.51
"This is my favorite of all the Dragon Quest games! Players of the series will argue, perhaps, as Eight, One and Seven were all incredible entries. This game though... just flows. It never misses a beat. Seamless cutting between action and story, scenes of drama and fights that blend perfectly. Characters to hate and fall in love with. It's all here. Oh. Gameplay. All of it is perfect. No kinks. Graphically amazing. Swapping characters and equipment mid battle is a breeze. This is the most accessible Dragon Quest yet. A must play.",5,1,0,93,421,10,135,16,3,78.13,3.81,5.73,6.63
"I can't believe I have not been loving this series for years now. This game requires exploration and mental mapping to a degree that no other series really approaches nowadays. This game (and series) is also a testament to aesthetics. The enemies are silly looking and have names based on puns and silly word combinations. Despite this, when the game wants to get serious, you buy into it fully because it stays within the boundaries of it's reality. the same goofy eyed behemoths can be made to look menacing or threatening by just changing the context around them. The total length of this long game is also staggering compared to what is acceptable nowadays. Love it!",4,1,0,118,541,17,182,8,8,61.38,8.36,9.15,11.66

"So stunning graphically that for the first time I can recall my ps4 actually had to stop and load for a few seconds while I was walking into one of the bigger towns. The monsters and even most bosses can be put down without much effort, so even though I know there are mechanics the game provides to make my team more powerful I honestly have no reason to take advantage of them. I have not yet completed the game but the story so far is kinda weak and generic compared to something like the golden age of Final Fantasy. The characters have somewhat interesting personalities but so far there has not been a lot of character development. I can only hope this changes further into the game but to have come this far without it makes the game less attention holding. All that being said if you are looking for the babies first RPG experience (new to RPGs) or just miss that classic line up beat em up game play, you could definatly enjoy this.",3,1,0,176,756,18,252,6,14,55.93,12.75,8.45,15.82

"I've always liked Dragon Quest games and have been playing them a long time, 8 has been my favorite of the series. This one is right there, however I've never really liked the voice acting in them ans this one is no exception. Not quite sure the direction they were given but it hasn't ever been that great. Maybe it's just me. Other than that I haven't had more than 10 hours and it's pretty addicting outside of my minor annoyance. The world is beautiful the combat is traditional with some flare and it's fun if you like JRPGs. There seems to be a lot to do.

"About what you should expect from a modernized Dragon Quest. It doesn't fundamentally change much, but the graphics are updated and some of the gameplay systems (battle, character growth) take a few pages from other games to take baby steps forward. Otherwise it's a very old-school rpg. Two caveats. One the music is still bad. I know it's Dragon Quest music, and it's just never going to change. But that doesn't mean it's good and that it shouldn't change. It's aged poorly, it doesn't fit the scenes it's on top of. And the composer is a bigoted fascist. Just change it. The other one is that the environments are too linear, in a geographic way. 8 and 9 didn't necessary have *larger* environments, but they had wider and more open environments that felt like dynamic places. When you look at the DQ11 map, it looks pretty big ... but very little of it is walkable. All of the dots are basically just connected by thin mountain passes. After you've traversed most of the world, it begins to feel small and constraining. You'll look at that last third of the globe and realize 'Oh, that's probably just a little valley.'

I heard Dragon Quest Builders 2 is come next year 2019! I hope this game don't need PlayStation plus (PS +) member similar to Minecraft and other games that don't need PS + to pay and play online. I'm prefer free over pay fees every months. My budget is tight can't buy many things. I will look to buy Dragon Quest Builders 2 when get on sale. I know this game will become world popular game that have multiple players online and coop players (2 to 4) offline. Can't wait! Excite for us! :-) Also I heard news about PlayStation 5. Good news PS5 system will able to play old PS4 games and new PS5 games (both physical disc and digital games).

"Hooo this game is a mixed bag... It's your typical Warriors/Muso game, you hack and slash your way through tons and tons of dudes while trying to take/rescue forts or handle other objectives. This game obviously revolves around the fanservice of Fire Emblem, something I'll get into when I talk about the story which ...is a massive negative to me. The combat is fairly shallow, you have a heavy attack + strong attack, special attack and a super mode. You can change characters on the fly and use items to heal as well as manage some gear. Don't expect Devil May Cry 3 level combat, enemies mostly horde around you and stare you down while side stepping left and right and rarely attack. The generals and such are the ones to watch out for, but even then, on hard mode I was finding myself failing only because of map restrictions. I'm making the game sound bad but, with the huge hordes and large war scaled combat the real focus is running around the map completing objectives WHILE killing tons of dudes. Think of it as a beat 'em up but on a massive scale. There's a good variety of characters but they seem to share the same moves depending on the class they are. There is the weapon triangle where some characters weapons best enemies better or worse depending on what/who you're using. Even on hard it's not that impactful I don't feel, especially if you switch characters on the fly. I'll start with the negatives: The 'story' mode is fine enough for gameplay but the actual story connecting all the events together is so comically bad it's like your average or lower fighting game. Characters breaking out into fights for the dumbest reasons only to join up as allies right after. I mean really dumb reasons. You find one character, help them out then their sibling thinks you kidnapped them and now it's a fight to the death. You win the battle and everything is peachy! ....Minus the fact you cut down 1000+ of their army because of this brain dead misunderstanding. Characters that fans probably really like are reduced to one dimensional characters who can't wrap their head around basic situations. Yes, I know it's supposed to be a big fanservice free for all but it's ....paaainful. The english voice acting is pretty bad, some voices are alright and I think I know some of them from the Tales games, Xillia & Berseria and those voices are fine but for the most part voices are either bad to just alright...There is Japanese voices but you have to download them because ...more cartridge space=more money for the dev. So it's a hefty download if you want the Japanese voices and I didn't like much of the voices either. Most of the girls sounded like a cliche desu girl. Lyn being HIGHLY surprising on how they made her sound. I'm not against the girly desu girl voices ...when there's some variety, which I don't feel there is here. The real issue with the voices is they do not, ever, shut up. Every menu action, every upgrade you buy, every item you sell , every menu selection is followed by repeated dialog over and over, and over, and over. I don't care if you like the voices or not, this will grate very fast. I do not know what they were thinking. Anyway, on to the positives. The game has 2 modes for gameplay performance: graphics & performance modes. Graphics is 1080p/30~fps vs 720p 60~fps, being this is an action game the performance mode is the only right way to go. It runs much better than Hyrule Warriors on WiiU because of Switch's superior hardware and these options. This is especially apparent in 2player mode which I HIGHLY recommend you play on performance mode, the framerate stays above 30 this way and honestly with the split screen I don't think you'll notice the visual downgrade on performance mode. There's also more enemies on screen in 2player mode vs Hyrule Warriors which seemed to struggle to get the bare minimum amount on screen to complete the challenge quests. That is not to say that the enemy count/pop in/etc is GOOD in 2player mode, it's good enough to have some fun with a friend. Honestly they should have had a local multiplayer mode at the very least but they didn't go for that. I played a few hours co-op and had a much better time than Hyrule Warriors in co-op at the very least. Honestly, it's probably the best way to play the game. You can cover a lot of ground and enjoy some fairly mindless combat with a friend. There's some good post game stuff here that I think is done WAY better than Hyrule Warriors. The game is pretty good, but do not buy this for the story, do not buy this because you think your character is going to be super cool in the game (they'll likely shock you with how dumb the story makes them act). You get this for hack and slash fun. And its' a good time for that.",3,6,1,899,3753,82,1255,50,8,70.48,7.89,7.1,10.84

"Fire Emblem Warriors is a near-perfect marriage of two seemingly incompatible franchises. This entry into the Warriors genre takes inspiration from several of the Fire Emblem series' most iconic mechanics. The Weapon Triangle improves the strategic depth of the Musuo genre by encouraging the player to form a well rounded team and pay attention to the locations and advantages/disadvantages of their allies. The Pair Up system removes an ally from the battle to greatly boost the player's hero - allowing the player to choose between more damage output/survivability and greater map coverage. Class promotion adds a greater sense of progression to the Warriors formula. The support system encourages players to vary their teams between matches to improve allied bonds and unlock later conversations that bring more depth to the characters. All of this is complemented by a more streamlined, effective ordering system, which allows the player to determine where each of their AI allies would be most useful at any time. As the Warriors series is objective-focused, this is an enormous improvement to the formula. Map objectives become less of a frustration and more of an opportunity to make the most of the AI companions - who are far more useful in this entry than in any other game in the genre. Fire Emblem Warriors is also the most polished Musuo game to date. While the roster is comparatively small and has quite a few clone character templates, each character feels fun, polished, and effective. There are no underpowered characters. There are no characters that feel lackluster to play. Even traditionally clunky, boring combat styles in the Warriors series (like cavalry), feel fluid and fun to play in Fire Emblem Warriors. This is a remarkable achievement which points towards an admirable attention to detail by Koei Tecmo. That said, the game isn't without its issues. It is popular to criticize the roster, as this is the most controversial facet of the game with the Fire Emblem community. Older lords like Ike, Alm, Roy, Eliwood, Hector, Ephraim, and Eirika are entirely missing. Questionable inclusions like Cordelia and Frederick beat out more unique, important characters. This is a subjective matter, however, so I would not consider it to be a negative point for the game. More objective issues tend to be much more minor. Namely, the spammed voice dialogue on character crest upgrades, buying/selling/upgrading weapons, support ranks, and other such features are incredibly annoying and cannot be disabled. Most players will likely mute their televisions while attempting to do anything in the camp. The level up notifications are authentic, but also break the flow of gameplay; thankfully, the level up notifications can be disabled. These are all surface level issues, which, while baffling, don't significantly impact the gameplay experience, in my opinion. Overall, I would say that this game deserves praise. It's a large step forward in quality and innovation for a largely underrated, if somewhat stagnant genre. This game is a must own for any Musuo fan and the best possible entry into the genre for any player who is on the fence. Pros: Increased tactical depth compared to past Warriors games The most polished Warriors game to date Every character is effective and well-designed Lengthy story mode and a wealth of history mode content - great value for money Local co-op Cons: Repeated voice dialogue for character upgrades and other camp features will quickly become obnoxious Abundance of cloned movesets Lacks online co-op Controversies: Questionable roster - may not ideally represent the Fire Emblem community's wants.

"First off, if you do not like Dynasty Warrior games do not get this. If you like Dynasty Warrior series or have never tried it, pick this up.

"The Fire Emblem property being applied to the Dynasty Warriors franchise of games works a lot better than Hyrule Warriors, a past Nintendo-DW hybrid. The art-style is gorgeous, the whole game feels charming, and there's a lot more variety in the characters you play as from the source games, rather than six different versions of Link (like in HW). Overall, I just like this game. The voice acting can get a little cringy sometimes, but the soundtrack is interesting and the gameplay is surprisingly fun for a DW game. Decent alternative to the traditional Fire Emblem title, and a good way to spice it up for fans of the franchise.",4,1,0,113,506,16,169,5,11,57.37,10.87,9.22,14.7
"I am obsessed with this game. I was not a big fan of the dynasty warriors series originally. The first entry to draw me in was Hyrule Warriors. It brought in fantastic characters and environments to the game to make it more familiar and catch my attention. Fire emblem warriors goes the same path, drawing upon well known heroes from the games. However, where this game stands out is taking the fire emblem strategy elements. Having more control of all the actions of your characters, the weapons triangle, and pairing up characters for combo attacks and defense, there's a ton of strategy. You can pick between usually four characters to control, and the rest of the army you can command indirectly or team up with them to give you stat boosts. Controlling your army feels like fire emblem, and all the characters feel useful. Many times I've told characters to fight a base or a boss, and am surprised when I'm told they've been successful. Characters will also sometimes ask 'what should I do next? Which indicates they need direction.' There is also performance or quality modes, depending if graphics or frame rate is your main concern, and it works awesome. While I was very hesitant of this game, I can 100% say it is a blast, and I would highly recommend it as a switch must have!!",5,1,0,232,1028,34,342,14,8,65.3,8.27,8.47,12.49
"Hooo this game is a mixed bag... It's your typical Warriors/Muso game, you hack and slash your way through tons and tons of dudes while trying to take/rescue forts or handle other objectives. This game obviously revolves around the fanservice of Fire Emblem, something I'll get into when I talk about the story which ...is a massive negative to me. The combat is fairly shallow, you have a heavy attack + strong attack, special attack and a super mode. You can change characters on the fly and use items to heal as well as manage some gear. Don't expect Devil May Cry 3 level combat complexity, enemies mostly horde around you and stare you down while side stepping left and right and rarely attack. The generals and such are the ones to watch out for, but even then, on hard mode I was finding myself failing only because of map restrictions. I'm making the game sound bad but, with the huge hordes and large war scaled combat the real focus is running around the map completing objectives WHILE killing tons of dudes. Think of it as a beat 'em up but on a massive scale. There's a good variety of characters but they seem to share the same moves depending on the class they are. There is the weapon triangle where some characters weapons best enemies better or worse depending on what/who you're using. Even on hard it's not that impactful I don't feel, especially if you switch characters on the fly. I'll start with the negatives: The 'story' mode is fine enough for gameplay but the actual story connecting all the events together is so comically bad it's like your average or lower fighting game. Characters breaking out into fights for the dumbest reasons only to join up as allies right after. I mean really dumb reasons. You find one character, help them out then their sibling thinks you kidnapped them and now it's a fight to the death. You win the battle and everything is peachy! ....Minus the fact you cut down 1000+ of their army because of this brain dead misunderstanding. Characters that fans probably really like are reduced to one dimensional characters who can't wrap their head around basic situations. Yes, I know it's supposed to be a big fanservice free for all but it's ....paaainful. The english voice acting is pretty bad, some voices are alright and I think I know some of them from the Tales games, Xillia & Berseria but, voices are either bad to just alright...There is Japanese voices but you have to download them because ...more cartridge space=more money for the dev. So it's a hefty download if you want the Japanese voices and I didn't like much of the voices either. Most of the girls sounded like a cliche desu girl. Lyn being HIGHLY surprising on how they made her sound. I'm not against the girly desu girl voices ...when there's some variety, which I don't feel there is here. The real issue with the voices is they do not, ever, shut up. Every menu action, every upgrade you buy, every item you sell is followed by repeated dialog over and over, and over, and over. I don't care if you like the voices or not, this will grate very fast. I do not know what they were thinking. Anyway, on to the positives. The game has 2 modes for gameplay performance: graphics & performance modes. Graphics is 1080p/30~fps vs 720p 60~fps, being this is an action game the performance mode is the only right way to go. It runs much better than Hyrule Warriors on WiiU because of Switch's superior hardware and these options.

"If you've played a Warriors game then you know what to expect. Tons of enemies to hack and slash your way through and use your specials to wipe out a bunch of them at once. This one has two-player co-op after the first three missions. The frame rate can chug a bit, but their is an option for performance to turn down the visuals for a bit to get a higher frame rate-- though I wouldn't say it reaches 60 fps when playing co-op. Their are still some time when enemies would not be as populous in some areas if there are too many in the other player's area. Despite all that, the game is fun and still feels rewarding after tearing through thousands of enemies. The main differences between this game and other Warriors games are that the characters are obviously Fire Emblem themed. The weapon triangle also appears in this game, but with only a few exceptions, you don't need to worry too much about. You can also pair up two units together on the battlefield and they add a few extra benefits, including raising their support to get rare materials. You can also send your other characters commands to take over a base or to run away if things get too perilous for them. There are also quite a bit of missions to do in the History mode after completing the main story. Their are some collectables in the main story that you have to revisit and some on higher difficulties. You can also upgrade your characters a lot, and you will need a lot of materials dropped by the enemies and some received by characters through support leveling up. Overall, this game is fun to play with a friend that will make you feel like the hero you are playing without too much difficulty. It has a lot of things to unlock after the main story if you wish to pursue that, and DLC is to be released in the future. Pick it up if you want a great Warriors experience with some Fire Emblem themed characters.",4,0,2,358,1501,36,497,16,10,66.68,9.52,7.53,12.97

"I purchased the first installment of Street Fighter V back in 2016, and I felt that the game, while fun and complex in its fighting mechanics, was just lacking so many features, stages, fighters, and story mode. Quite frankly, it was a disappointment for some, myself included. A few patches later, updated features and a barebones story mode was introduced, which showcases character voice acting combined with still images. Enter microtransactions, you could earn fight money, the games currency, through completing story mode and online battling, which granted players the ability to grind and save up to buy a new skin for a charactersigh. Thankfully, with this new release of Street Fighter V, most of all DLC characters, skins, pallets colors, and stages are included, and it is just a much more complete game. Story mode is still not great. However, the fighting is just fun and challenging. Street Fighter fans rejoice, as it took Capcom three releases to release and complete game.",5,0,2,163,798,21,250,8,12,56.4,10.45,11.53,13.3

Aladdin was my favorite Disney Movie back in the day and that led to my love of the game. The remaster makes this game a classic again with vibrant colors easy game play with the joy cons and just a fun game brought back.

A couple of cons here: 1) I wish they would have remastered the games to play in full screen without stretching or borders. 2) They left out a few games, namely the SNES version of Aladdin which is completely different from the Sega Genesis version. It's probably because that game was made by Capcom and there were likely licensing issues. I would have loved to have it as part of this collection. The games are still amazing to have on the Switch on a physical cart but only for about $20,00 tops.",4,0,1,109,462,13,152,7,7,73.06,6.94,7.22,11

"I bought the regular version of this game for X-Box and for PC because when it came out in 2015 and it is one of the best Yu-Gi-Oh games released. If you want an up to date Duel Monsters game that has story and just about every trading card available, then this is it. Now, the Nintendo Switch version has been released with the added Link Evolution DLC and it pretty much adds the the VRAINS saga to the game and all the Duel Monster cards included with it. The graphics have also been changed a little when you are dueling and it really breathes some life into the game if you have already bought the previous version and want a reason to pick this one up. The animations for when you summon a monster like Dark Magician have been redone and IT IS LITERALLY WORTH BUYING THIS GAME AGAIN because they did an amazing job at it. I love that they touched up some stuff to make it feel like you get a better game after 4 years.",5,3,0,182,735,13,245,6,13,62.16,12.12,6.97,14.99

"If youre looking for a yugioh just purely based on playing the card game and not looking for rpg elements or anything like that then this is the best game to get ever for the series. It has over 9000 cards, All the yugioh series from Yugioh duel monster to gx to 5ds etc with all the stories of their animes condensed down to all the important parts and all the important duels. I havent watched or played yugioh since 2005 yet when I played this game all the nostalgia came back and it was easy to pick up and remember it as there is a tutorial that breaks the game perfectly for every series. An absolutely must buy for any nostalgic fan or die hard fan or even new fans.",5,1,0,131,538,13,181,4,15,56.7,13.49,7.44,17.07
"Its been a few years since I bought a Yugioh game, and this game caught my attention as it contained every generation of the franchise up the release of the game. Its very addicting! Its nice they have a huge collection of cards to choose from! Would definitely recommend to any Yugioh fan out there :)",5,1,0,55,241,6,77,4,7,74.44,6.29,7.81,9.86
"It's been awhile since I've played a yugioh console game (or the game at all for that matter) and this was enjoyable in some regards because I got to play with somewhat recent cards and learn some of the newer mechanics I'd missed out on over the years (Xyz, Pendulum, Links). It does have some interesting features like the ability to play using drafted decks or sealed packs. The promos that come with it are cool but I'm not really interested in Cyberse so probably won't use them. However the game has alot of cons and I don't even know where to start. I guess the forced master rule 4 would be the biggest complaint. I watched an interview with a developer and he stated the story mode duels were supposed to 'feel like the anime' but with master rule 4 you can't have more than one extra deck monster out without link monsters, this wouldn't be a problem if they tweaked the decks to fit in some links but they kept the decks the same as their original series to be 'faithful' despite the fact you can't be faithful by, let's just say for example, fusion summoning several heros in GX as Jaden onto the field together. Yes you can use your own deck instead of the story decks to incorporate links but then it feels like, what's the point of trying to make it feel like the show then? Also the story mode skips some important duels, and the text before a story game can range from a single line to a chapter in text (all can be skipped though by pressing Y). The banlist for the game is a weird mashup of cards and I wouldn't really mind it if we could still play casually online or locally however we wanted and just left the banlist for ranked, sadly that doesn't seem to be the case. Last time I tried to play locally with a friend any decks I had with a card that was 'banned' didn't show up as an option for me to use against him. You can use them in any amount against the computer but that just feels silly unless you're trying to grind rewards. Another complaint would be how they handle duplicates when opening packs, once you've opened at least 3 of a card it doesn't stop you from opening it again, this wouldn't be a problem if the game had a feature like how in some past yugioh games you could exchange extra copies for more in game currency to buy more packs. Instead you never actually have more than that third copy and eventually you could be opening hundreds of packs using thousands of in game currency just to open the last 50 something cards you need from a particular pack. The game has forced animations for some cards that can't be skipped and overall the gameplay just feels slow. Don't believe me? Just watch any video when a card excavates more than 2 cards from the top of the deck and you'll start to realize how slow everything is going. Overall I wouldn't say this game is terrible, it does have access to alot of cards that you can play while chilling on the couch or in bed with the switch in tablet mode. It's more faithful to the actual card game compared to Duel Links which is Speed Duel rules. But Link Evolution is lacking in a lot of ways that seem like really simple fixes that just weren't pursued.",2,1,0,616,2489,48,828,19,14,60.21,12.92,7.05,16.09
"So to be honest, I never played the original release of this game. To be honest, its probably better that way, but its likely great regardless.

Many endless hours of content here, especially online.",5,1,0,57,259,8,90,5,6,61.69,7.49,8.32,10.17
"This game offers a ton of content featuring over 9000 cards that Ill probably never find the time to use each one individually. This version of Duel Links reigns supreme over the PS4 and XBox versions since it includes all DLC and additional story arcs in the main series. I was skeptical about purchasing this game because I only played followed the Yu-Gi-Oh series up until the 5Ds anime.

"This game is a lot of fun. For those of you who aren't aware, the game is based off of multiple animes from Japan, so the game is voiced in Japanese, but there are english subtitles. The fighting itself is so much fun, you can create a character with your favorite moves from almost any character in the game. The downside is the physical traits of the created character are very minimum. There are options for eyes, nose, mouth but the differences are almost non-existant. There are plenty of costumes you can unlock via missions or by earning in game currency to purchase. There are no microtransactions! The story is pretty simple and un enthusiastic. The cutscenes aren't really cutscenes, but it's a fighting game, I don't really care. Basic story is there's some bad guys, you fight them, then you pick the next mission and do the same. Etc. There is a lot to do between the main story, side missions, and online as well as 'split screen' multiplayer. I say split screen but the screen doesn't actually split. I was wondering how they would do it with a 3D fighter that's not side by side, but they did it well. The camera turns behind each fighter throughout the match, giving a whole new perspective. The downsides are the mission hub style set up. Instead of menus to choose missions, shop, upgrades, etc you have to run around a hub and talk to people behind a desk. It's not hard but it could have been simplified to menus, or they could have organized the hub a little better. The game also frequently crashes, and online loses connections very often. It's really annoying. A lot of the offline crashes have been fixed with patches, but it still happens every now and then. The game offers a challenge but it's not impossible like some other fighting games. There are points where you might start getting frustrated, but if you can read the AI and predict what they're going to do they're defeatable. This is the first game I've ever 100%ed. My first platinum trophy in my life, and I've been playing video games since I was a kid. That doesn't make this game easy, it makes it doable. There aren't any impossible or hidden acheivements so if you're a trophy hunter like me you'll enjoy working towards 100% on this one. Overall I think the game is great but could use some improvements. There are 3 characters in game that you fight (boss battles) that I'd like to see be playable, or at least be able to unlock their moves, but even after 100% you can't. The game isn't physically rewarding. Yea you get gold (in game currency) to unlock more clothes and abilities, but that's it. You don't get anything besides trophies for completing the story, no special unlocks, no exclusive gear, just the standard gold and experience. The online is even worse. The rewards are basically non existent. To put it into perspective you need 1500 gold to buy the cheapest thing and 30,000 experience to rank up, online will give you 100 gold and 10 experience. It's nothing. If you want to grind, the free missions (like side quests) offer a good way to do so. The characters all seem fairly balanced and there's only a couple of characters that if you come up against online and someone knows how to exploit their tricks, they'll be untouchable. These few characters will probably (and hopefully) be updated and balanced since they have an unfair advantage in the game. The computer AI on very hard and Expert is ridiculously cheap. They reverse and dodge everything, and do some outlandish things that may send you screaming. Again, they are defeatable, this actually puts them at a disadvantage because it makes them predictable. For instance I know when I press the attack button they are going to immediately use their ultimate so I will bait them into wasting it and either missing me or I block it. You can almost control what they do because they react to your button presses. It's unfair at first until you learn what they're reactions are going to be.",4,1,0,734,3135,77,1047,45,7,69.6,7.6,7.5,10.72

"When the first skate came out i immediately was interested to see how it was. When I bought it i was hooked instantly. Pulling off crazy flip tricks in a realistic setting and with realistic physics was a blast. Then the second came out offering a bit more with a much more interesting world and the very useful ability of getting off the board and interacting with objects in the environment. I loved these games and have a ton of recorded in-game footage and photos to prove it. I was excited to get this one as well since it was yet another skate game. Unfortunately for me, however, I found this game a bit too familiar for me. Yes, there have been refinements and a few new additions to the formula, but largely for me it felt the same. I don't hate this game, however. I still think this is the best in the series quality wise. If you are a newcomer to the skate franchise then definitely start out with this one. It's not dumbed down or anything like that, but more accessible. There are a bunch of useful and in depth tutorials to help you get the basics down with more advanced ones to help you nail the more difficult tricks. Visuals, gameplay, and other aspects of the game have been refined as well for a better skate experience. Being able to customize pretty much everything about your skater is still great. There are plenty of options. Being able to customize your own parks is a neat addition as well. I do like the structure of the 'story-mode' in this game too. I just found the experience a bit stale only because I had felt like I had played the game before. There just wasn't enough of new content to keep me interested for very long. I am confident, however, that EA can do new things with the next installment to make it a fresher experience. I fully recommend this game to those who want to get into the skate series.",3,5,1,348,1461,40,494,22,7,70.69,7.33,7.01,10.92

Another glaring disappointment is that there is no online play... Nintendo just launched Nintendo Switch Online and this could have been a great opportunity for Nickelodeon to launch the game by simply offering at least some form of online play.

"I've rented this game a few months back and was able to beat this game. I went into this game with an open mind. Yes, I've seen a few reviews of this game, but I wanted to share my own thoughts and experiences with this game. **PROS** ~ Yooka-Laylee is filled with quirky and memorable characters. Such as Capital B (main antagonist), Dr. Quack, Trowzers, and featturing a special guest - Shovel Knight from Yacht Club Games. ~ Collect Pagies (equivalent to Jiggies): You collect them to open up more new worlds or expand the world that adds more stuff to do in it. ~ Collect Quills: Collect Quills to unlock new moves for Yooka-Laylee to help progress to places you couldn't traverse before. ~ There's a Hub World to explore from Yooka-Laylee's home to Hivory Towers. It's all connected. ~ The soundtrack to Yooka-Laylee was fun, memorable, and enjoyable to listen to. The ones that stood out to be was Tribalstack Tropics, Hivory Towers theme, Capital Casino Boss theme, Galleon Galaxy Minecart ride theme, etc. ~ Transformations - Like in Banjo-Kazooie, Yooka-Laylee can transform into different things. With the help of Dr. Puzz's transformation ray. With these transformations, they can gain access to areas that they couldn't before. **CONS** ~ Rextro's Arcade Games: they were not as fun as I would have hoped. There were like one or two that I actually did enjoy playing, but the rest were not that great. ~ Kartos' Minecart Sections: It was cool to see some side-scrolling minecart levels that are inspired by DKC minecart sections. But... I didn't have as much fun as I would have liked. There's a slight delay on the jump. I wish you could kill enemies if you jumped on top of them. There were a couple of minecart levels that I did enjoy. One from the MoodyMaze Marsh and one from the Galleon Galaxy. I remember there were issues that people had with the game when it first came out, but those issues have been patched out. Luckily, the Switch version had the updated patches already in the game. I wasn't too crazy about the $50 price tag since the PS4 and Xbox One versions costs less. Luckily, I had a $10 gift card to use to reduce the price. Inside the case comes a small instruction manual, [man, I miss those days when games had physical manuals]. and a Limited Run pamphlet advertisement. There's also a reversible cover that shows the whole cast of characters from the game. If you don't like the front cover, you could just switch it over to the reverse side. Overall, despite its flaws, Yooka-Laylee is a decent game to play. I hope that Playtonic will take the feedback and improve the formula in the next Yooka-Laylee game. I am looking forward to playing Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair. I've heard good things about that game.",4,2,0,500,2157,47,705,37,6,73.83,6.32,7.38,9.17

"While I'm a From Software newbie, having been intimidated by their previous efforts, the aesthetic and the setting really pulled me into this one. Also, I've always had a bit of FOMO with From Soft games, wanting to be in the conversation, but too fearful to try. Sekiro is a masterpiece. Is it incredibly difficult? Yes. One boss took me a literal two weeks to defeat. TWO. WEEKS! But the highs that come from finally getting that last deathblow on an incredibly tough enemy is where the addiction comes from. I finally see what all the fuss is about with From Software games - and immediately purchased Bloodborne as a follow up. If you're curious, give this a shot. Learn the system and try it. Maybe it won't completely click -- but stick with it until you beat a difficult boss. If it still doesn't click then? Maybe it just ain't for you. Me? I've just spent another week bashing my head against the Guardian Ape - and all I'm thinking about is strategy on how to take it down.",5,5,0,185,769,23,264,17,4,75.06,5.49,5.92,9.33
"NOTE: Soulsborne vet here - 100% all prior installments - 60+ hours with this game. An excellent experience, but in my opinion cutting past the hype of a new release --- it's a very clear step back from Bloodborne and Dark Souls III. Fans are going to buy this regardless of what I say, and I encourage them to, so rather than focusing on the game's obvious strengths - let's look at it's weaknesses to temper some expectations. Sekiro breaks every rule of Soulsborne mechanically. It's control scheme and necessary play style force the gamer to lose their prior muscle memory of any of those games or they will be punished. This provides as close to a fresh experience as possible for even Souls veterans, and while the new mechanics have some definite advantages over prior ones, whether you like it better or not will come down to your own subjective judgment. For me, these new mechanics encourage too much button-spamming (get ready to break your L1s and R1s people) - something that Dark Souls and Bloodborne (I thought) were right to punish. The special attacks in this game (stabs, sweeps, grabs) are also terribly annoying because you need to react to them in specific ways, but a kanji (identical in all three cases) often obscures them, making it much harder than necessary to react. Some mini-bosses also require specific consumable items to damage, which is genuine artificial difficulty - for real this time. Much of the design philosophy in this game aligns with the black sheep of FromSoft's recent work --- Dark Souls II. There are multiple 'lifegem'-like items and a lack of truly interconnected world (fast travel is once again open from the start and most paths terminate in dead ends rather than the intricate world design of loops and shortcuts in Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne). One 'shortcut' in this game is legitimately more insulting that the Iron Keep volcano on top of Earthen Peak's windmill (the revolving wall from the top of Ashina Castle to Dilapidated Temple). Where at least DSII could pull some impossible space lore to justify this, there is no such argument to be made in defense of Sekiro. The music is an unfortunately same-sounding disappointment after previous installments. The addition of area music is a frustrating mistake as most will likely come to find it repetitive every time the standard 'combat theme' goes off the thousandth time for a three second fight. Boss themes are made less memorable occasions by the addition of area music, and are often more chaotic this go around than actually having any thematic grace. Lastly, the main hub area has no unique theme unlike Majula or Firelink Shrine - a major departure that cheapens its significance. Lastly, the central new feature of this game - the resurrection mechanic - rarely feels like you can employ it to any sort of tactical advantage, as enemy AI often stays around your body even after you die and is still often alerted to you getting back up at ridiculous ranges. It boils down to an extra half a health bar, nothing more. The stealth mechanics and new focus on platforming are incredible add-ons in their own rights, but unfortunately provide a multitude of ways to now cheese most of the game, taking much of the skill out of actual combat and replacing it with something that, while interesting, is ultimately just less satisfying because of how easier it is to earn this way. Also, it goes without saying that the lack of character customization, multiplayer, and genuinely different stat 'builds' greatly reduces replayability. In fact, after the first playthrough, almost every pickup in the game becomes practically worthless as without more than one weapon to upgrade, all upgrade materials have literally no purpose after you max it out, which is shockingly easy this time - no Pure Bladestones here! DISCLAIMER: Despite only mentioning my issues above, I still highly recommend this game. It's by far a GOTY contender and a worthy experience for any FromSoft fan. I simply have to say that for a project with Miyazaki's direct involvement, I expected more. It definitely feels like Activision got their hands on this one.",4,5,0,706,3333,115,1127,26,15,44.23,13.84,10.87,17.38
"I love Demons Souls. I love Bloodborne. I enjoyed the Dark Souls series. Sekiro is Bloodborne level of genius. This may look like Nioh, but this is not Nioh. I will say both are equally frustrating, but Sekiro does not suffer from infinite stunlocks that hampered Niohs combat. Sekiro may not feature the varied combat of Nioh, but the simplification of stances has made for less complex, but equally satisfying combat system that'seasier to master. The world created here is unique and beautiful. The bosses and enemy placements make sense and pacing flows incredibly well. Had to get use to combat based on posture and parrying, but once I got it this frustrating experience became one of my favorite games of all time. This was an annoying game in the beginning, but just like every fromsoft game, once you learn the mechanics you start experiencing the unique rewar of achievement these games provide.",5,5,0,154,734,27,241,11,9,60.23,8.34,10.11,12.61

There's some enemies early on who test your sanity. There's some elements of dark souls, but it plays completely different. It's more of a stealth game first, otherwise you'll mobbed and killed quickly. When you do have a straight up fight it's all about precision parrying, timing up your enemy, blocking, using the awesome prostetic arm, and going for those beautiful executions.

"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is not a SoulsBorne game in terms of mechanics. It is unforgiving which is the commonality between the FromSoftware games. And your patience will be pushed to the edge with Sekiro but it is so WORTH it. Upon defeating a boss, you will sit back and relish their defeat. And then soon after you will anxiously move forward to see what awaits in the new area that has opened up as a result of the defeat of said boss. What I really liked about Sekiro is that it allows the player room to breathe compared to past games like Bloodborne or a Dark Souls game. If you're feeling pressed by an enemy, you can flip backward, dodge sideways or sometimes grapple to temporary safety. That said, Sekiro rewards you for being aggressive and having quick reflexes. Basically, you have to unlearn what you were taught from Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Your muscle memory will adjust and in no time, you will be aggressively slaying enemies that had destroyed you an hour before. The visuals of Sekiro are breathtaking. Not since Bloodborne have I been this impressed with the landscape in a FromSoftware game. If you're like me, you're going to explore every nook and cliffside that lead to secret areas. And there are PLENTY of secrets. And yes, Sekiro isn't an RPG like other FromSoftware games but you are encouraged to upgrade your side abilities which there are a lot to choose from. So, sharpen your blade, take a deep breath and prepare for an emotionally taxing adventure that will be worth the rage.",5,4,1,272,1219,35,402,16,9,64.55,8.48,8.81,11.95

Of course this also means that you are standing in front of Front Software enemies so if you don't get good at it then expect to have a hard time. The world is amazing, with twists and turns and hidden passages and secrets. Front game worlds are among the best and this is among their best. Just be aware that it is a haaaaaard game.

"I've been a big fan of From Software games since the later King's Field games, and have loved all of them up until now. Sekiro is no exception. It is decidedly more fast-paced than the Souls games, and focuses on fast, smart, aggressive combat tactics not entirely unlike Bloodborne. The feeling of playing a shinobi with a grappling hook is perfectly realized -- by the time you reach the end of the game, you'll have honed the playstyle to a razor's edge and feel in tune with the game's eponymous protagonist.",5,1,0,96,405,13,137,4,11,61.74,10.61,7.77,15.02
"If you're a fan of the Dark Souls/Bloodborne games, you won't be disappointed with Sekiro. It shares many similarities with the previous From Software games but has enough changes and additions to feel fresh and different. The world design is absolutely top notch, with the grappling hook ability adding a sense of verticality and depth not seen in previous Souls games. I would say the game's difficulty has been grossly exaggerated. It's definitely challenging and can take some time getting used to the complexities of the combat system but it never reaches stages of ridiculously, controller smashing hard. The bosses are all well designed, feeling tough but fair. In fact, I'd say the most challenging encounters are the few optional bosses. So if you're just looking to clear the story, it shouldn't be too much of an obstacle, with a little practice of course.",5,1,0,152,701,22,235,8,10,56.75,10.06,9.76,13.39
"If you mastered the SoulsBourne games and are expecting to hop right in to From Software's newest game and start wrecking, you have another thing coming. I'm a SoulsBourne veteran. Hundreds of hours in all the games. The games are almost easy now and yet Sekiro destroys me. Absolutely wrecks me so thoroughly that it almost makes me regret buying the game. I spent nearly two hours on the first MINI BOSS. Not an actual boss, but a freaking mini boss. The game play is wildly different than From Software's other titles. I don't remember ever being this frustrated with any of the SoulsBourne games. With those games, beating a boss always produced an intense feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. So far in Sekiro, beating the big bois just leaves you feeling exhausted and relieved that the suffering is over. Hardly any satisfaction or accomplishment. Very little of that SoulsBourne high that drives you forward through the punishment, craving more. When you die, you lose XP similar to the SoulsBourne games except you can't get it back. Once it's gone, it is gone for good. And if you die enough times, all the NPC's in the game suffer from a disease that then prevents many of them from talking to you and giving you side quests. It is not easy to cure this disease. Not sure if I'll have it in me to finish this game. At least the story is interesting and on the off chance you beat a boss with perfectly timed deflects, counters, and dodges, it looks pretty cool. Expect to stumble through the fights though. Now excuse me as I go relive last night's Sekiro session while crying in a corner.",3,2,1,294,1282,31,420,21,7,71.77,6.73,7.73,9.82

"Being made by FromSoftware, the comparisons to Dark Souls and Bloodborne were obvious. Though Sekiro does draw a lot of inspiration from those titles, it's an amazing game in its own right.

The world isn't as open as the Souls games but it's filled with many twisting paths and shortcuts like them. Being a FromSoftware game, it's challenging so if you're looking to breeze through a game, this ain't it.

"The game is hard. Not really a surprise for a game from From Software, but the design goes beyond that. To begin the story flows and twist like a great mystery novel and has the player wondering. The gameplay has a steep learning curve, but once learn the combat becomes fulfilling and enjoyable. While there are few tools and fewer weapons to pull from, the open way of deciding how to play does not. Going from stealth to open combat easily. Planning how to fight or when to retreat and regroup. The is enjoyable because of its difficulty giving a sense of accomplishment when a tough part is beaten. While many of the bosses are a pain and tedious to fight. The slow and steady grinding of the fight challenges to the patience of the player. Many parts are confusing and the use of similar areas can feel repetitive. Personal I miss the ability to both aid and be aided by other players. This is a great if stressful game.",5,1,0,170,740,18,246,13,6,71.14,6.59,7.53,9.47
"From Software is famous (or infamous, depending on your viewpoint) for putting out tough-as-nails games. I thoroughly enjoyed Dark Souls and was extremely excited to test my skills against From's new style of action-RPG. Needless to say, anyone who's used to the Souls series' turtling/armadillo approach to combat will go through an adjustment period to start facing attacks head on, as Sekiro is adamant with punishing passive playstyles. In spite of the obvious difficulty, this game shines with visceral combat and highly memorable boss encounters. There's a huge sense of progression seeing your use of healing items decrease as you learn a boss' patterns. Even aside from the amazing combat, exploration is rewarding, with tons of items to find off the beaten path. Give this one a shot - games that provide this level of fair challenge and mechanical polish are very few and far between.",5,1,0,152,724,24,240,7,12,51.22,11.51,10.84,15

"The premise of this game is you are honor bound to obey your master in life and death. This game is produced by From Software, meaning you will die, many times, sometimes unfairly and other times because you pressed the wrong button at the wrong time. Of the SoulsBorne category, I would rate this game as the hardest and perhaps the steepest learning curve. When fighting opponents the newest mechanic from From Software is posture breaking, essentially you are attacking and parrying to weaken the stamina of the opponents allowing you to perform a death blow. The music is quite peaceful with a slightly haunting quality. The graphics are done quite well, I would say stunning. I truly felt I was in a war-torn landscape from feudal Japan. Occasionally enemies will not fully load until they are attacking you, which happened a few times to me but it is rare and you can learn where they come from. A new mechanic was also introduced that allows your character to respawn during a fight after death but you cannot do so multiple times in quick succession.",5,1,0,186,857,19,271,9,11,62.6,9.66,9.86,12.35

Veterans of that series will quickly realize that although Sekiro is Dark Souls and Bloodborne's successor, the same formula of playstyle in those games cannot be applied to Sekiro.

"In my view Sekiro is a decent but not great game. While far from being awful, this game does not deserve the high scores that it has received as result of the unexpected zeitgeist From Software has enjoyed for the past decade. While some aspects are fun and well presented, its shortcomings ultimately stem from From Software's attempt to combine two types of games into one, while doing neither of them very well, or at least not nearly as well as those that are top of class in each category. Sekiro is a ninja/samurai action game and it's a stealth game. While the combat is okay, it is, in my view, completely outclassed by Nioh which not only has the parrying mechanic of Sekiro, but multiple weapon types, 3 stances per weapon and dozens of moves per weapon. Sekiro tries to nail the dance of sword fighting, but Nioh executes that dance much more effectively with greater variety and a much smoother frame rate. The limited attack options in Sekiro basically come down to a game of blocking, parrying, jumping and attacking with a simple fixed combo. The challenge of the game is in learning each enemy's attack patterns and selecting the correct sequence of parries, jumps and attacks to break their posture and deliver a deathblow. When first presented this feels very challenging, but as soon as it is memorized it goes from challenging to trivialized as you learn to fight in the game's intended metronomic fashion, simply keeping the beat until you can deliver a 'shinobi deathblow' (fancy name for quicktime event) rather than engaging in dynamic combat. Because the AI is very simple, enemies rarely mix up attacks like they do in Nioh. This combat system is further marginalized by the inconsistency of quicktime shinobi deathblow. Sometimes a red dot appears when you sneak up on an enemy without them noticing, other times you can repeat the exact same scenario with no dot. The jankiness of this mechanic is demonstrated most often in the context of dropping onto an unsuspecting enemy and baiting enemies around corners-- situations in which triggering the quicktime shinobi deathblow seems at times truly random. I'm not sure if this is because the game wants you positioned in a very specific way and fails to account for what is displayed onscreen, or if the variable framerate is to blame. In an event, it creates a sort of randomizing effect to the game where sometimes I found myself missing kills I felt I had earned, and at others getting kills I felt I did not. This aspect significantly erodes notion that one can 'get gud' (or not be good) at the game. As a stealth game, Sekiro does much worse compared to the best in class, namely, Metal Gear Solid. The stealth options and AI in Sekiro are behind the original Metal Gear from 1998, and the game is so far behind the stealth mechanics of MGSV that it's not even comparable. At times enemies will spot you when you are completely out of sight and at others they will fail to notice you when you are right in front of them. Unlike Metal Gear, enemies make no changes in their behavior based on your actions. A quick assault and retreat does not result in reinforcements being called in, nor do enemies change their combat tactics or armor choices to defend against over-used attacks. This is a shame because stealth is such a vital component of any ninja/shinobi based game. It seems like a missed opportunity since From Software jettisoned the RPG elements of its previous games in order to focus on the shinobi archetype, which was them hamstrung by lackluster stealth mechanics. From Software has made a fair game, but in order to be great you can't just make a new IP that is decent or perhaps better in some regards than your previous games, you must make a game that competes with what others have done in the space you are trying to occupy. Sekiro falls short of this, but it's still a decently enjoyable game to play for a short stint. I will say that some aspects are well done and more enjoyable than From Software's previous titles. The speed of the game makes it more engaging and as always, the art direction is excellent. From Software's games are always presented with a certain serious mood and artistic design that makes them beautiful to look at and the color palette of feudal Japan is their best yet.

I know it's not a souls game, but I really disliked being stuck into a single play style without real room for adaptation and creative play: I found it to be very repetitive and frankly more than a little boring. I also have a kiddo, so the over the top bloodshed was a bit much for me. At least in souls or Bloodborne you are fighting monsters and things that don't really look like normal humans so when there is blood it's far less impacting. It's just a side note, certainly didn't keep me from playing, but it bugged me a bit. The arm prosthetic were all quite underwhelming. I really expected the abilities they gave you to be more useful, but they really do little good aside from tactical necessity, which just makes them another button to push instead of a fun extra weapon or tool.

"After logging more that 200 hours in PC Skyrim, I thought there was no reason to revisit it again. I was wrong! It took me a few hours to adapt to using the move controllers, and to adjust screen brightness and controls properly, but once done in in love with Skyrim all over again. Hundreds of hours await you, and while the resolution is far lower than what I played with on pc, the game is so immersive, you'll find totaled just gawking around while in caves, or just taking in the night sky. You could easily just buy a psvr and Skyrim and justify its purchase. My wife also gets motion sickness, but she can play Skyrim for hours without problems. If you are considering getting it, Just Do It!",5,8,1,132,552,9,184,7,8,69.77,8.21,7.22,10.27
"I've owned and finished Skyrim on my XBox 360, played it again when the 'Special Edition' came out on my XBox One, and now playing through it again with my PSVR. Despite having played this game to death, it's such an INCREDIBLE experience to play it in VR and to be ACTUALLY INSIDE THE GAMEWORLD! After starting it in VR and playing for 7 hours straight, I lost track of how many times I said 'Wow! That's awesome!' as I revisited familiar locations in the Game World. The immersion level is awesome and though many may complain about the somewhat 'fuzzy' graphic quality, the feeling of immersion and feeling like you're actually walking around in Tamriel is absolutely breathtaking. I'm actually quite happy with the overall graphic quality (I'm playing on a PS4 Pro) and kudos to Bethesda for giving players so many VR 'comfort' options so that those more prone to motion sickness can set the options to make it more comfortable. I personally have no issues with 'VR Sickness' since I've been playing with my PSVR for almost a year now, so I've disabled all the extra VR limitation settings to give myself the full experience! This is a DEFINITE MUST BUY for any current PSVR owner and also a great way for people still thinking about getting a PSVR to finally pick up a headset and experience the wonder of VR.",5,5,0,242,1046,27,364,9,13,52.29,12.65,8.51,15.22
"There are not many titles that can boast being open world and VR. This is the same game most of us know and love, but the VR aspect adds a new dimension. Personally, I find the game to be more of a technical feat than the preferred method of play. There are certainly episodes, events, and highlights that take advantage of the VR technology, but once the novelty has worn off, I do not anticipate any but the most diehard of the VR or TES fans/enthusiasts will have a lasting appeal for the countless hours it takes to play through Skyrim. Between Doom VR and Skyrim VR, on the basis they were released the same date, I would venture to say Doom is the better VR iteration, because it is a different game, designed around VR rather than a different perspective of the same game. I'm not disappointed with the purchase overall, but for my style of play, shorter sessions in a game packed with as much content as Skyrim tends to make the VR presentation less appealing.",4,4,0,180,771,18,253,6,14,57.48,12.7,8.4,16
"I'll start off with I own Skyrim for ps3, ps4 and pc so that should tell you how much I liked this game. Playing in VR is INSANE! They had to scale down the graphics a little so it's not graphically as good as the remaster but you will forget all about that with in minutes of playing really. You can use move controllers or a dual shock but I would recommend the dual shock. This is not a watered down version it is the full fledged game!",5,3,0,90,344,6,118,5,6,77.65,6.9,5.03,9.87

"Skyrim is my only VR game that I return to after the novelty has worn off. This is the same, entire fantastic game, playable in VR, with move controllers. The graphics take a huge hit, and some balance issues come about because you can perform actions much faster than you can with a controller, but this is an incredible way to replay an incredible game. The feelings of standing by a waterfall in a cave, drawing your bow while sneaking up to a goblin, or getting to a mountain top under the stairs are incredible in VR. Especially recommended if you are used to VR and don't get motion sick. There are great movement options for people who do get sick, but they are not afraid to let you turn them all off and walk around like normal if you want, which I appreciate.",5,2,0,145,610,11,203,6,11,63.87,10.36,7.71,12.7

"Playing a game like Skyrim in VR is the reason to invest in VR. However, moving with the move controllers frequently results in teleporting past walls that you are not supposed to.

If you are looking for the immersion but don't want the movement bugs, the use of a standard controller works fine.",4,1,0,80,347,10,119,4,9,60.69,9.76,8.22,13

Yes, the VR elements are really nice & work surprisingly well, but what I'm most excited about is finally being able to play this game on console at a smooth 60 frames per second, even with a regular DualShock 4. I was very disappointed that the Skyrim Special Edition on PS4 didn't have this, and as a result, I didn't purchase it. So this is a decent compromise.

"X is a series that I really enjoy, X1,2,4 are games I come back to often every year as they're fun to blast through. The collection here? It's a mixed bag. For one you don't get all the games- you have to download the rest which is immensely irritating. You buy games to not take up space on your tiny SD card, not some half and half nonsense. This is further annoying since the PS4/XB1 versions of the game come with another disc for the other half- AS DOES THE SWITCH VERSION in Japan, where it's sold together OR separate. No such options here. The second half of the collection is the larger of the two as well, setting at a hefty 6.6GB vs the first part at 2.9. As for the actual collection you do get a lot of stuff, merch pics, the ability to play the Japanese versions of games*** the anime from the PSP title (but not the actual PSP remake) and the XChallenge. (Japanese versions of the game do not have the original Japanese intros, infact Megaman X6's English intro which had japanese is entirely replaced. All commercials that had japanese have been removed as well). Nevermind changes to X4 where they have removed a 'potentially offensive scene' and darkened certain scenes to help not set off epileptic fits- something that isn't done to much more aggressive flashing in any point later in the game, cutscenes or otherwise. Sound emulation is off on the PS1 titles, it doesn't make it sound bad, but different. Sound effects seem to be much better mixed, where you can hear the enemies making noise where in the OG you couldn't. The issue is, the SNES titles (X1-3) do not save your game like the PS2 collection where it had a new screen to display your powerups and what not- it just remembers your password. So if you get the hadoken fill up etanks etc? Doesn't save that stuff. This is something they had on the PS2 collection but couldn't manage now, something the PS2 version also did was remove/lessen slow down in games- this one does not. The X-Challenge is pretty okay? You can't pick your fights, they're all preselected boss-rushes. You fight 3 sets of 2 enemies with a set number of lives and get to pick from 3 powers, and as X only, no Zero. Some fights are fine, others are INSANELY hard on the normal difficulty and Easy is TOO easy. The first half of this collection is pretty gold, X1 is great, X2 is also really good, X3 is ...alright, X4 is great. The second half is where the series got a bit funky....and bad. X5 is okay, X6 is the worst (with great music), X7 is runner up for worst, X8 is alright... I hope that explains the mixed bag part of the title. There's great games here, but the execution is lacking and half the collection is arguable in it's value should be on the cartridge, there's really no excuse for it not to be given the games that have easily fit. (their reason is so they can sell them on the store separately and they need different SKUs & physical versions to match, it's a poor excuse) Should you get it? I got it because I want portable Megaman X and while the games can be got on PSP/PSV you don't get the SNES titles, just the PS1 games. So, options are limited. Should you?

"This is a great collection of MegaMan X games. It plays very well in tablet mode; I haven't played connected to the TV yet, so I can't comment on how that works. I have heard mention of some minor input lag with this version, but I didn't notice any playing with it. One standout addition was the Novice Hunter mode, which is essentially an easy mode for the games. I found it helpful to play on this mode for about half an hour or so when I first started to get used to playing these games again, since I hadn't touched them for so long. It could also be fun if you have young children, so that they can play the same games you do without having a rough time with it. For adults, I would definitely recommend playing with a pro controller. I played in handheld for a bit, but the button layout was causing my hands to cramp up due to the small form factor of the joycons, so I ended up using the kickstand and playing with a pro controller instead. Finally, my major caveat: the cartridge in the box only includes X collection 1 (1-4). Collection 2 (5-8) is included as a download code. I have heard the PS4 version includes both games on a single blu-ray, and almost bought the collection on that platform because of it. I finally decided that off-TV play was more important than having a physical version of both, but it is worth noting that you don't actually get the whole collection in this box.",4,2,1,273,1100,21,368,12,9,69.7,9.19,6.59,12.18

"As happy as I am to have the entire X series available on my Switch, the collection falls short of excellence for a few reasons. The second half of the collection being limited to a download code instead of a cartridge is infuriating. We have multiple Switch systems in our family, so we like to be able to share our game cards. When a game is only available as a download, that is option goes away. My other big issue is the lack of features that I consider pretty basic when emulating classic games at this point. There's no save state feature for instant file saves, instead relying on the original games' built in save menus.

Why give a game 1out of 5 stars? Presentation! They are presenting half a game collection, and requiring the other half to be lost in cyberspace when Nintendo decides to shut down the servers to re-download it. Don't think it will happen? Nintendo just did it with the Wii, and previously the DSi. I have a massive collection dating back 40 years.

"I have always liked Far Cry games and have been playing them since 2 on the PS3. But out of all of them, I would say that New Dawn is something special. It takes almost everything that made 5 great and improves upon it. The only aspects that are weaker in New Dawn compared to 5 is the story and size/scope (but that's necessarily a bad thing). First off, the weapon creation system, while not mind blowing, is a nice throwback to 2 where your weapons would malfunction without the frustration. In the beginning of New Dawn when you pick up a random weapon off of a dead guy it doesn't work that well. It's slower to reload and shoot because your character is fighting dirty mechanisms and rusted parts. As you get better gear it works much better (although it's usually not much prettier). This is a really nice system that adds to the experience. I also liked the addition of the damage numbers showing when you hit your target. This might annoy some but I really like it. Character models, visuals, environments, and sounds are all improved compared to 5. I know it's got to be running on the same engine so I have no idea how they made it look better, but they did. Also the HDR color on this game is fantastic. The bright magenta flowers that are everywhere really pop on my 65 inch TV. HDR makes the sunsets and sunrises in this game quite beautiful too. Speaking of visuals, the setting of New Dawn is very interesting. It's obviously post-apocalyptic with strong Mad Max vibes with the driving, Highwaymen, gas wars, bullet farms and hodgepodge style weapons. It also has moments that it reminded me of The Last of Us and Dying Light (although there are no human zombies in this game) while exploring the overgrown buildings for resources and using the new running/jumping mechanics respectively. These are all media that I love so I will say I enjoyed the mashed-up feel. YMMV, of course. Like I said in the beginning of my review, the only weak point compared to 5 is the story. 5's story was frustrating at points but it really sucked me in and made me feel like I was living it. New Dawn's, however, relies a little too heavily on the supernatural. But, I will say I like the conclusion better than 5's. And the shorter story made it so I got through the game without getting burned out, which I liked. Not every game needs to be a triple-digit-hour slog. This is especially fine since the asking price of the game is considerably lower than most AAA games. It's also a pretty easy and fun Platinum if you are a trophy hunter. To summarize, if you like Far Cry games, you should give this one a go. I doubt you will be disappointed. And, as a surprise to no one, if you don't like Far Cry games you won't like this one. New Dawn is unmistakably a Far Cry game but somehow manages to feel nostalgic and fresh at the same time, and that's an achievement worth celebrating.",5,2,0,548,2273,50,763,33,7,72.19,7.32,6.81,10.29
"The story and setting, the diverse weapons, the challenges, the ways to earn perk points, the rooster of support characters, the vehicles, the expeditions, the outposts (and recapturing) all topped off with an ability to double jump.

"Not quite a sequel, not quite DLC, Far Cry New Dawn is some sort of unholy amalgam of the two that perfectly represents this age in gaming: a video game that manages to rip you off with its small size and disappoint you with its small amount of content, all while pretending to be a new entry in a storied franchise. Don't believe it. The game has maybe 40% of the content of FC5, without any of that game's surprisingly great story or characters. In this one you are simply tasked with taking down two post-apocalypse baddies and... that's it. No intrigue, no cool new gameplay elements. Just go over there, shoot, and come home. This would have been a fine addition to a $20 season pass. Instead, I'd just give it a pass, period.",2,4,2,140,569,14,193,9,6,74.42,6.74,6.2,10.22
"The long and short of it... if you liked Far Cry 5, you'll like New Dawn. It's a continuation of the story and a tweaking of several gameplay features. It builds more of a crafting system too, which is a fun addition. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because it was something fairly easy and simple for Ubisoft to make and is a cash grab. It feels lazy of them to do, but is still fun. Feels a little contradictory to say that, but hey. Just my opinion. Happy looting!",4,2,0,97,369,7,131,9,2,81.64,4.55,3.82,7.2

"If you've played Far Cry 5 then you were probably left wondering what exactly happened after the end credits. Well, New Dawn attempts to pick up the story 17 years after the original game's ending. I'll say that after playing through the original game, I didn't expect the route the developers took with the sequel. Without giving away spoilers, this game left me a bit disappointed. I really can't say why without spoiling the story so I'll just leave it at that. Gameplay is entertaining and much like the FC5 so if you liked that, you'll be satisfied with this. The NPC's are amusing and will have you laughing with their off-the-wall one liners and snarky comments. The problem lies with the length of the game and the amount of content available. The main missions are short and could have been fleshed out. Then again, this game is only 40 dollars so I should have expected a shorter campaign.",3,2,1,169,716,14,236,10,7,71.54,7.48,7.36,10.07

"This is the first Soulcalibur I have purchased since the Dreamcast and as a sequel to the first, it would be amazing. As the 6th in a series by the same developer that makes the Tekken series, it is an attempt to port the evolution of one series onto the graphics of another. It has inherited the customization of Tekken, but also the excessively slow fighting style. Every move has to be perfectly timed in a nearly robotic manner or the player comes to a complete stop that requires a gap before accepting input. The AI is designed to have an expert response to these gaps and will retaliate with an array of attacks that ends in your death. This is not a game of skill, but a game of repetition. You will find that many players in ranked and unranked matches have become so accustomed to this style that even their attacks follow a very obvious and redundant pattern. For those of us that come from Dead or Alive and the fast-paced fighting games, it is not hard to adjust for the 'lag' and easily overcome these mechanized opponents. In terms of quality, the game is a visual masterpiece with technical mediocrity. It's a fun distraction until Dead or Alive 6.",3,1,0,214,933,27,321,10,10,58.21,10.46,8.45,13.61
"SoulCalibur has always been a great fighting game that's fun for casual and competitive play. It's pretty much the only 3D weapon fighting game that's still in existence. If you played any of the games in the franchise, you know what you'll expect in terms of gameplay. The newest gameplay mechanic introduced is the reversal edge system. It basically works like a guard impact (effective against throws and low attacks even), but the character immediately follows up with an attack afterwards that launch a rock-paper-scissors mini game. Vertical beats horizontal, horizontal beats kick, and kick beats vertical. The problem is that this mechanic slows the game down to a guessing game. It's a good way to build meter for critical edges and soul charges though. Critical edges are basically like super with an easy input. Soul charges are powered states that give attacks special attributes depending on the character, it also open up a new moves that can be used. They're okay though I prefer no meter for my 3D fighting games. Single player content wise, the game is beefy at least with Libra of Souls and Soul Chronicles. The first is similar to weapons master mode in past SoulCalibur game(with more of a RPG twist where you can weapons and level up) where you create a character and fight in various battles with varying conditions. It's very text heavy so expect to do a lot of reading. The mode starts off easy, but cheap A.I. becomes prevalent at higher level where they read your input. The story isn't anything to write home about though it does flesh out more of the lore. Soul Chronicles is your traditional story mode for each character that features static character portraits and voiced lines between bouts. It's not bad for what it is I guess. There's an Arcade mode though you just fight through seven or eight characters. All the story content are pushed into Soul Chronicles. There's also always the Create A Soul mode where you can create your own character with fighting styles used by existing characters in the game. Online is what you expect with casual matches and ranked matches. The latter can take awhile with matchmaking some times. The game overall has a budgeted feel. Graphics are okay, but could be better compared to past games and other fighting games currently out. There isn't even a intro video. I'm not a fan of how Tira was cut off and sold as DLC even though she's in the main game already. Overall, SCVI is worth it if you're into fighting games and it's not a bad choice for fans of the franchise or newcomers. It's a simple game to get into, but has good depth if you want to play on a more hardcore, competitive level.",4,1,0,487,2134,56,713,31,8,67.03,7.81,8.08,10.88
"This installment of Soulcalibur is A LOT of fun! I think the developers learned from their mistakes with Soulcalibur V and improved on what worked with the previous entries. As a longtime fan of the Soul series, I can say that this fighter is approachable for both new and veteran players. Add the new features like Reversal Edge and Critical Edge, and there's a lot to learn without feeling overwhelmed. This fighter rewards the player for combos and skill whereas other fighters are all about the 'rock, paper, scissors' formula of mastering a match. The visuals and sounds are stunning as always as you'd expect from a Soulcalibur game. I do wish that there were more fighting stages and added to the 'mood' as we had seen in past games but it's not a deal breaker. The online is solid and I have found that there is hardly any lag when taking on opponents. Of course, you can always have friends/partners play against you with a second controller. If you're looking to tackle the single-player challenges then you won't be disappointed. There's A LOT to do without getting bored. And that's not including the campaign. I do wish that this game encompassed everything but alas, there's a season pass offered that will eventually offer four additional characters and armor (for custom creation characters). At the end of the day, you're getting a fun and gorgeous fighter with Soulcalibur VI.",4,1,0,250,1118,27,371,14,9,63.16,8.89,8.84,11.46

"Ok so from what I've heard. This is a great game. I got other friends pre ordering battlefield 1, or skyrim, but in all honesty, I've missed DBZ games so much, and just wanted to play another great one after such a long time! The last time I played a dbz game was DBZ budokai tenkaichi on the ps2. Is it gonna be as good as that, of course not, but it will be an amazing game that people should definitely check out. Especially if you haven't checked out a dbz game in forever just like me! With 20+ stages and 80+ fighters, and being soo much better from xenoverse 1, i don't see why you're not buying the game right now. Why aren't you clicking pre order! Do it! But in all honesty, just get the game, you won't be dissapointed. :)",5,6,2,149,560,13,194,11,4,82.94,5.06,4.11,8.91

"Having never played Xenoverse 1, I was a bit worried the learning curve would be too big to overcome, or I would just be downright lost(you can even import your existing character from Xeno1), but I'm so pleasantly surprised that's not the case! Xenoverse 2 delves into DBZ territory and transitions all the way through Super. I was also worried, as an offline player, the gameplay would be limited, but again, I was wrong! As far as I can tell, I'm still getting to navigate through the main story line and there is no shortage of things to do. The game takes place in Conton City, where you get to be your own new character as a time patroller! Following orders and instruction from the Supreme Kai of Time and Elder Kai, you get to right the wrongs of the discrepancies of some of the greatest events and battles throughout Dragon Ball history. You get to fight along side some of the best, and can even chose your instructor(don't expect Vegeta to take too kindly to you at first!). The whole premise of the game is just really cool and there's always somewhere to go, or someone to see... Whether it's battles, side missions, training, collecting supplies, or even just helping out your fellow Z fighters. Now, here's where the 4 stars come into play... The game play in battle can get a bit repetitive. Sure you can train to learn these awesome 20 button combos, when you're fighting Frieza AND Cooler at the same time those long, multi-button combinations kind of go out the window and you just stick to your few tried and true. The navigation of the actual game can be a bit confusing at times and you truly just have to 'figure it out' because there's little to no instruction when it comes to that. But honestly, if you're a fan, you have come to love and accept that the Dragon Ball universe has it's own logic and is just plain confusing at times. The background music in your main map, Conton City, is Dreadful to the ear!! Lol. Go to settings and change it... Immediately!! So, even though the gameplay at times can get a little repetitive and stagnet which may leave you turning it off that particular day, after you've slept on it, you find yourself wanting to come back for more the next day! That's a good thing! Solid game with awesome graphics. Voices of the characters are spot on as well!",4,1,0,435,1815,37,603,23,8,70.37,8.14,7.17,10.97

The customization is awesome. Also if you like DBZ Xenoverse 1 then this basically improves upon that game in everyway. It's so great to play a Saiyan and be able to Kaoken, SS 1, SS 2, SS 3.... So awesome to have no eyebrows and huge hair as SS 3. Golden Frieza. Pure Form Kid Buu. Namekian giants! It's just awesome. I would play a Saiyan though since SS 3 doesn't require stamina or anything so you can stay as SS 3 the entire fight vs Kid Buu for instance drains stamina and you eventually get kicked out of it. My only complaint is that the story should be co-op! It would make it way more fun since Parallel Quests are okay, but they can get pretty stale since a lot of them have bad rewards. I enjoyed the story though. You can really identify with your character and you feel a part of the universe as a Time Patroller.",5,1,0,198,778,19,277,16,4,75.92,5.74,4.91,8.79

"First Dragon Ball game I have played but I had a lot of fun with this. I am a trophy away from platinum 100% completion... which was a unique grind... The combat took me a long time to get good at, but I was never good at fighting games. After a ton of play time I did get a very good control of the game which enlightened me to how well it was actually designed. Dragon Ball fans will all enjoy the story line of the game play and those who enjoy fighting style games will take even more enjoyment with the fluid combat. The online features in my opinion were very poor. There is no online co-op for story related missions but there are 100 quests and 17 expert missions you can do with teams of 3 and 6 respectively... Honestly I think it's best to do all of these solo with AI generated teammates which disappointed me veRyan bad at first and I think most of the community would agree.

"I have heard all kinds of things about No Man's Sky, from its procedurally generated worlds to its impressive planetary scale. However, I avoided buying it in 2016 due to some of the backlash I heard about it not being complete or offering what was promised. Cue in No Man's Sky Beyond, a re-released version of the game with all the updates installed with it on the disc! And boy are there a lot of things added. For starters, there's base building, which is something I really enjoy after playing games like Fallout 4 and Minecraft. You can create a base on any location on any planet you wish, and it feels good to build your own space colony of sorts. Another addition is multiplayer, though I haven't used that yet since I don't have the subscription to play online yet. And furthermore, there are more story elements and quests to run and even a third-person view which was not present in the original version. These additions make the game feel like an experience you can call your own, and I love it. On the downside, there are still a few goofy things like weird-looking alien lifeforms as a result of the procedurally generated creatures system. And while the game technically has a story, it can still feel aimless as you might just get lost in what you want to do (though honestly that's more of a good thing since there are a lot of things to do). You can explore the planetary surface, build your base colony, pilot starships, engage in space battles with said starships, trade with aliens or just simply wander the impressive open world (open-planet?) environments in the game. The feeling of hopping in your spaceship and blasting off the planet's surface into outer space without any load times at all is still something to behold, even more so when you look back at the planet you were just on and see how massive it is. Or even the opposite when you enter the planet's atmosphere and the landscape slowly materializes as you make contact with the surface. It's an interstellar wonder to just experience these elements in this game, and I am happy it was re-released with all the additional content and updates on the disc. This is easily going to be one of my most played games ever.",5,2,0,408,1757,41,587,17,11,60.76,10.75,8.29,13.62

"This entire game revolves around micromanaging your very limited inventory space. This game should suck you into its massive universe to explore, build, and expand. However, it gives you almost no inventory space to keep your materials and supplies. I found myself in my inventory around 90% of the time trying to see what I can throw away in order to pick up a quest item or a survival necessity. You are able to buy more space, but even at the maximum, it is nowhere near enough. It's a shame, too, because this game would have been fun otherwise.",1,1,1,100,436,13,154,6,8,59.63,9.08,8.06,11.87

"I watched and read many reviews about playgrounds 2 and just about every one focused on the micro transactions and how it's a cash grab. I get what the stink is about but just playing the game itself if fun and nice to pick and play. Sure I want all the great players and I can buy the whole roster if I want. I can also grind it out and try to unlock them too which is what I plan to do. Yes it is tedious at a point but also what makes me want to come back and play more. If I unlock all the players then I'll just be bored and won't play at all. I got the game for less than 20 bucks and it was a good investment in my eyes.",4,7,0,138,483,4,163,7,5,86.9,6.04,3.28,9.05
"I have never been a huge sport game fan though I did really like the arcade style games like NBA Jam and NFL Blitz which are faster paced and less about picking plays and simulation. NBA Playgrounds 2 is not exactly like NBA Jam, but it does have a similar spirit in that it's a fast paced arcade style game. The gameplay is alot of fun. And that is really important. Games are quick and alot of fun and other diversions like 3 point contest is addicting. Local co-op is also a blast to play. This would be an easy 5 stars if it were not for the unlocking and progression system. You have to unlock pretty much every player on the roster. Most games give you at least a small amount of characters to start with. And this game kinda does that. The way you unlock players is through buying in game 'packs' of cards. Those cards are your player unlocks and they vary in cost using in-game currency. You could of course also use real world money via micro transactions. This wouldn't be so bad if the game gave you at least two players from each team. But no, the game gives you a small set of starter packs that give you a few players to start with, around 10. So obviously you wont get enough to be able to play as all teams at first. Because the game is two on two, you need at least two players unlocked to play as that team. So if you are a Lakers fan for example, unless you get at least two Lakers players in the starter packs, you really wont be able to use the Lakers. So you have to grind to earn baller bucks and buy packs in the hopes of getting lakers players. Or you can buy specific lakers players for a huge amount of Baller bucks. This is where the game makes you feel like they want you to spend actual money instead. I got lucky and unlocked Scotty Pippen and another bulls player to start so I have been using the Bulls and I have been earning currency pretty steadily but I have still not unlocked all teams with a minimum of two players each. The game will give you at least enough to start with maybe one or two teams but it might not be the teams you want. And that's what really bogs this experience down. NBA jam had a full roster ready to go. You already are paying for the game. This model makes this game feel like a free to play game or freemium game. It's too bad too because the gameplay is really great.",3,3,0,460,1837,28,598,28,6,80.18,6.16,5.88,9.01
"the upgrades from the first game: 1. jordan and kobe are the biggest additions 2. you can get special clothes and costumes 3. there is a season mode that feels like an actual nba season. the old game just had random exhibition matches in different countries. 4. playing and leveling up actually mean something, in the first game when you leveled up you only got special animations. however in this game leveling up increases your stats. thats great. addicting trying to get your fav players to top stats. 5. 3 point contest is added. 6. online is integrated very nicely. much better options than last game. tons of ways to play online. 7. more cool music instead of the 1 song on the other game. 8. the UI in general is just tons better. much more polish. the old game seemed low budget in this regard. ok... now the bad things: 1. missing key players. james worthy/reggie miller/allen iverson/charles barkley/vlade divac/karl malone/tim duncan/ben wallace/steve kerr/wilt chamberlan 2. also a little nitpick but i wish some of the players where available on different teams. kevin garnett is only in the minnisota roster but i want him on the celtics. there are various other players that i also want on other teams. the first game had more than this game. overall a huge upgrade to the last game. tons of fun.",4,2,0,238,1037,25,349,32,3,75.23,4.61,5.84,7.18

You still have to level up every player and then conduct skill challenges to achieve their highest potential.

I love the new camera and special player animations. The short meter seems to have less lag than the first version of Playgrounds.

There is plenty of action in races to keep you busy. Even while driving around a normal bend you will find yourself busy checking on your teamates. There's no slow-turns here!

"I have so much fun with Tetris 99! It's a Battle Royale mode meets Tetris gameplay with much more involved! Now while the main game does require you to be online, this packaged version also comes with the DLC that allows offline play, which is a big plus for those looking to brush up on their skills when they don't have an internet connection. You start out playing regular Tetris and, as you destroy rows, you can send them to enemies (98 other players who are also randomly paired against you online) but they can also send theirs to you as well. As the field narrows down, it gets faster and tougher! I believe the best I did was 7th place...haven't seen first yet! There is also a two player mode and you can also play and earn themed levels! This also comes with a 12 month Nintendo Switch online subscriptions. That's a $20 value with the game (including DLC) costing $10. This would be the exact same price as if you just got the online, downloaded the free Tetris 99 through the eShop and then purchase the DLC for $10.

"I was skeptical when I first saw footage of the game. It seemed too bleak and simple, what is there to do? Then MS started slowly showing new content and footage and it became more appealing. I pre-ordered the game and have tried the Closed Beta and I don't remember the time before this one where I said 'This game is sick.' to a multiplayer game while nervously chuckling to people I was playing with. The nervousness came from the thrill of the game. You go on missions which are only limited to looting chests in beta, and get to know/bond with your teammates. Sometime after going out to sea you may run into other pirates and when you and 2 other ships have all come to the same island from opposite sides and you all got chests on your ships, things get intense and your team's bond and teamwork is tested like I haven't felt before or in a long time in a game. I was lucky enough to log in and join a team with a guy who helped with learning the game and we voyaged out for 2.5 hours together while cycling through new members on our team. So remember that this game can take at least an hour to get used to but ultimately its easy to pick up. One time we were all looking at the map and a newcomer got so drunk and threw up all over us so we put him in the Brig, which is a little cage on the ship's bottom level serving as a timeout. Another time we saw another ship and we had no treasure so we risked attacking them only with 3 teammates. After some back and forth battle moments, we sunk their ship and they happened to have 3 chests of booty which we stole and brought back to town. A cool part of the game is that gear is simply cosmetics and there are no levels or super powerful weapons you get from playing a long time. The good thing about that is everybody can play together regardless of rank, nobody gets left out and if you don't play as much as your friends, that doesn't mean you two will have to stop playing together because they are too far ahead. It's a fun game and the experiences it offers are fresh, exciting and imaginative. Excited for Day One and where the game will go from here.",5,28,8,421,1669,28,547,18,9,73.18,8.86,6.24,12.02

"Let me start off by saying the graphics are absolutely stellar. While sailing the ship around you can easily spend several hours experiencing the wind, rain and wave affects. Stunning. The game takes forever to load on X Box One X. Really, start it up and then go get your favorite beverage because when you return the game will still be loading. The developers included splash the words to a cute pirate song to try and distract you while it's loading. It may work once but after that it's simply annoying. The game play itself is SLOW. Seriously, the missions involve starting at an island, sailing to another island and digging treasure or grabbing farm animals and then taking back to the original island. They take forever. In addition, there is a high probability someone will come along and kill you. Usually, someone or group of someones are just running killing everybody and taking the loot. Which means you have to start all over. If you happen to die you go to what I assume is Davey Jones locker. Where you WAIT again (forever) for the game to respawn you somewhere else. I really wanted to like the game. I was hoping for a fancy Age of Booty game. But alas 'tis not to be.",1,3,0,217,944,23,318,18,6,70.62,6.4,7.32,9.06

"This game gives you a sandbox environment to have some great pirating adventures if you give it a chance, but it is not for gamers who need a very structured gaming environment all the time. The best description I have read and can provide is SoT is like being given a toy pirate as a kid, and you played with this toy pirate by creating by acting adventures either alone or with friends. You loved playing with this toy pirate, and only wished there was some way to make the adventures more real. That's what SoT CAN be if you let it. It provides an interactive play field where multiple 'kids' get to play out this pirate fantasy in the same place with others doing the same thing simultaneously. For those who have realized this potential, SoT can be amazing. However, if you are someone who needs to have your game completely defined for you, telling you what to do all the time and have little interest in this type of sand box adventuring, this game will probably not make you happy. Word of warning even if you think you are ready to make SoT your personal adventure gaming environment... currently there are a very limited actual pre-created adventures provided in the game, and most of these basically require you to do similar things. You will be required to complete an egregious quantity of repetitive fetch quests that has ever been required in ANY video game to gain the sweet bounty needed to make your pirate the envy of the seas. If Rare does not keep adding some form of content to the game it will risk losing its fanbase quickly. Read reviews and forums before you buy the the game to make sure you understand what it is and what it isn't before you put your coin on the table to purchase the game. If you go in with a full understanding of what you will find in SoT, you mught just have some of the best gaming adventures you have ever had.",4,2,0,347,1489,40,491,13,13,60.03,11.52,8.32,15.29
"This game feels like a beta indie game. There's almost no content currently and I wish I hadn't bought it. For one, if you purchase the version from the XBox/Microsoft store you get two copies. One for PC and one for XBox, but not with the XBox physical disc purchase. There are already PC players using cheats like infinite health or aimbot. And to my knowledge there's no anti-cheat device in place. The only fun aspect of this game is multiplayer, and that's only fun if you find someone who's fun to play with. Honestly this game should be no more than $30, for the content it has to offer currently. There's no upgrading anything in the game. The only thing to unlock are vanity skins. After collecting treasure and dropping it off for a few hours, we headed to a Fort. We beat that brought the treasure back again and now all that's left is to defeat the Kraken. So currently the entire game can be played in about five hours.

I kept it,and might go back someday.",2,1,0,76,290,3,91,7,2,94.52,2.77,3.91,5.92
"Your adventure on the high sea awaits. Sword Fighting... Check. Treasure hunting...Check Ships rolling over the waves... Check Danger from other pirates, monsters and storms wanting to take your life and your treasure.... Check, check and triple check. Sea of Thieves is very cool. This game successfully puts together a play set of muskets, swords, ships and pirate outfits that allow you to lose yourself in the game and become a pirate. It's set in an open world you share with everyone else playing the game. All of you going after various treasures or skeleton crews at the same time. Also you can at any time choose to go and fight any of the other human players in the game. This can at times be terrifying when you realize that you can't not play with other humans. At any moment the player in that ship that you see on the horizon might decide to see if you have any treasure on your ship and come after you. And there isn't anything to stop them. Except your own musket, sword and skill you gain while sailing the seas. This has led to multiple situations in my own game where I've had to fight off another player or two to keep them from getting a treasure chest I had just dug up. The best advice I can give you is to realize that while the pirate you are having to fight might have a super cool hat, peg leg, and a hook with tattoos and a sweet looking sword, he/she actually isn't any more powerful than you are. All of the 'upgrades' you can buy for your ship or pirate are only cosmetic. This means that the one guaranteed advantage one ship has over another is the number of crew. Your crew can consist of up to 4 pirates working together. It supports a closed crew where just friends can be on the same ship or you can join a crew of random pirates. I've enjoyed playing with my kids. So we take the smaller ship and there is usually just the two of us. If you choose to do the random assignment the community has generally been great. Lots of people have been very helpful and talkative while sailing. I can't say that I've made any life long friends yet but I don't encourage people trying to do that on the internet. Ultimately this always online structure and being thrust into a world and forced to interact with other humans will be the appeal or repelling force for this game. Much like playing dress up and imaging to be a pirate growing up, you are only going to get out of this game as much as you put into. There is almost zero narrative to be found in this game. As the point of this game is to do pirate stuff. So if a compelling story is what you come to games for I would certainly encourage you to pass this game. The journey is the point. Hopefully this helps anyone on the fence about this game, and if you think you'll be getting the game.... Well I'll see you on the high seas. Best of luck and remember to put the kegs of black powder in the crows nest. That way if it explodes it won't damage your ship.",4,1,0,573,2311,42,763,37,6,78.46,6.16,6,9.13

Any gold you get for doing these same 3 missions does not benefit you in any way as the only purchasable items are just skins for items you already have and do not upgrade nor will they ever. The good news is that the water looks great. I hope the water guy goes on to do great things in his career.

"This is a Pirate game meant for playing in groups... not as solo. I played the first few days on my own, using a sloop and trying to figure things out by myself. I tend to like PvE and not PvP so much. Unfortunately, this is an open world and after spending about an hour collecting things - another sloop came up on me and took my stuff. After a few times having this happen and literally dying at what I thought would be a safe Outpost port - I decided to play in a full Galleon mode. This was a much better overall experience. Again, it's about who gets paired with you - so you can get some folks that really shouldn't be in the group and are there to troll. There are mechanisms to get rid of them. Make sure you have your mic on as well. And for Pete's sake - don't let you 8 year old play. For PvE - Gameplay is buggy and glitchy and a bit repetitive. You jump around a lot trying to get around on the ship. You get used to it but it doesn't make it any less annoying. I hope it gets better with patch releases. The water dynamics and weather dynamics are awesome. The AI is pretty good as well.",4,1,0,221,850,16,290,17,4,82.63,4.96,4.54,8.1

You aren't working toward anything, the money you earn can only be spent on cosmetics for your ship or character, so you never get stronger, faster or anything like that. Makes you wonder why you are even playing this game when you aren't working towards a goal. The game plays like so: 1. Get on a ship. 2. Follow map to island. 3. Dig up treasure/fight skeletons. 4. Return to outpost trade in gold to buy a shirt that does nothing. Yup that's the game. $60, have fun. Stay AWAY!",1,3,2,125,490,8,167,15,2,85.35,3.42,3.7,5.89

"Sea of Thieves in its current state is nothing more than a skeleton of a great game. Massive potential currently ruined by lack of content and variety. There are only 3 mission types at this time, all of which are truly just fetch quests. You either go on a treasure hunt, find and capture animals (chickens, pigs, and/or snakes), or you hunt a bounty. There is currently only one NPC enemy type - Skeletons. There are a few types of skeletons, but otherwise you are just fighting skeletons over and over again. PVP is great, until you realize sinking an enemy ship puts you at a disadvantage when they respawn 3 minutes away with full supplies. There is not vertical progression. All progression is cosmetic based and currently there are only 3-4 clothing designs that have 3-4 recolored skins each. This game is beautiful, and sailing and goofing around with friends is fun, but after 3-4 hours you have seen what there is to offer.

"Just Cause 4 is arguably the most fun 3rd person shooter just out of the sheer absurdness and chaotic nature of the game itself. Just go around and destroy everything in the most creative ways you can think of. Your tether now has tons of mods that you can add on so there are even more ways to destroy things in this game. There's really no story, just go out in the world and wreck havoc. The game is naturally repetitive. 'Go here and kill everybody and destroy everything, go here and kill everybody and destroy everything, go here and do it again x100'. It's fun at first as I've said, but it does get old fast. There's very little other gameplay aspects to this game. The wingsuit challenges are back (and are easier now, thank god. JC3's wingsuit challenges were infuriatingly hard), speed challenges and then there's these tomb challenges (obvious nod to Square Enix's other series, Tomb Raider) where you have these short little puzzle challenges to figure out. Nothing crazy but they're good for a quick change of pace. The controls are really good and feel really fluid. You can seamlessly switch from the grappling to the parachute to the wingsuit and back again and it makes traversing the world fun. The gun play and tether system is also really nice and easy to control. I feel like the vehicle mechanics have been improved. The cars are easier to handle. I know that was a big complaint with the last Just Cause. Apparently, this game was built on a whole new engine and it almost doesn't feel like it except when you look at the graphics. The graphics are pretty terrible. Most of the time, the game is so chaotic that you're not even paying attention to the graphics and they make no difference to the core gameplay itself. However, if you just stop and pan around with the camera while you're standing still. Oh my, this game is a blurry, pixelated mess. But like I said, you only really notice it when you're standing still and this game is not Red Dead Redemption 2 and you're not standing still very often. You'll most notice it during cutscenes which are just bad in general (it is Just Cause after all, it's not supposed to have a good story or engrossing cutscenes) but the cutscenes look like in early PS3 and that is no exaggeration. I mention graphics last because I'm not one to have graphics hold so much weight. It's totally aesthetic and does not effect the gameplay itself. I'm sure they'll patch it over time to make it look better. JC3 looked great but I remember it having some serious frame rate drops to the point where the game becomes a slide show. I don't know if they ever fixed that but something like that does hamper the gameplay experience. Luckily, JC4 doesn't have that but they severely downgraded the graphics to compensate in this new engine. It improves in some areas over JC3 while downgrading in other areas. I like all the modifications they added to the tethering system and the improved physics to allow to allow more craziness and creative destruction which is always good.

"I play a lot of games but have never played any in this series. So take this review with that in mind. But the game isnt very engaging and the environment is pretty but lacks a lot of detail and a lot of the AI is bad. The engagement with enemies is very poorly done. I had to turn it off after the first couple hours from boredom. Just for reference, I love playing games like horizon zero dawn, Fallout 4 ( 76 is not good at all), the far cry series, dying light, last of us, among others.

"A really solid, fun title if you're looking for a faster-paced, less strategy orientated Monster Hunter that's more geared towards action than the more methodical approach of MH (Monster Hunter). It's also much easier to approach game than MH for newcomers; every control and system is explained to you in a way that's easy to understand, making this a great game to get into if you're on the fence about the depth of these games. To go over all of the positive aspects of the game, I, of course, have to first mention the combat. The combat is, bar none, some of the greatest in any video game I've played in recent memory. The music can be hit or miss, but the majority of the time, I found myself either enjoying the score or forgetting it was there entirely as I focused on combat, but it was never intrusive or too much. The game also has an insane amount of customization allowed for your character with the number of weapons you can choose from, as well as a decent cosmetic customization system. The Aragami design, the monsters in this game, is also very good, and I'd go as far to say even better than recent MH titles. While this game does have stellar combat and a few other great mechanics, I do want to touch on the flaws as well. The story isn't anything to write home about and the dialogue really isn't up to par with most modern games, but the characters are memorable and charming. Another small issue is the mission design; Every mission you go into is very straightforward, with a path akin to a corridor, a room, another corridor, another room, and copy and paste this formula for almost every map in the game, meaning exploration is out of the picture entirely for this title. All of the maps in the game are also reused multiple times, taking away from the immersion in the game, but considering most people won't be too terribly into the story and its continuity, it's an easy flaw to look past. The visuals are also nothing spectacular. Take any JRPG from the last few years and you'll see that God Eater 3 looks almost identical to other games that came out years before it. The landscapes and design of some areas are interesting and cool to look at, but overall, it's just a small step below of what we should be expecting at this point, even for a switch title, but that also doesn't necessarily mean the visuals are bad either. I personally think it's a complete non-issue, I never really care about graphics in video games, but for the select few, I think it's worth mentioning that it isn't anything grand.",4,5,1,480,2008,53,708,15,15,49.57,14.3,7.87,17.22

"This is another in a great line of Dark Souls releases. If you're familiar with the franchise, it edges Dark Souls II - generally speaking - just barely and lags slightly behind Bloodborne. If you're new to the series, be advised; you may want to think twice about this purchase. This is a very difficult game where you will die a lot. An extremely frustrating amount of times, in fact. And if video games are prone to giving you fits of rage, then avoid this game and series at all costs. On the other hand, there's something very rewarding in this franchise with defeating a boss that other games fail to capture. It's incredibly addicting. As such, this is one of my all-favorite franchises. Highly recommended.",4,5,1,129,565,16,188,10,6,70.45,6.64,7.66,10.12
"Wow. I'm new to the Dark Souls series and it's worth it to note that no previous experience in the series is required to enjoy this game. This is the best single player RPG experience I've had since FF7, Zelda, Diablo - I haven't played games in years. I understand why this series has such a strong cult-like following now. As new player that's unfamiliar with the series, you really have to push through the initial learning curve to really start appreciating the game for what it is. What do I mean by that? It's a game that doesn't leave good first impressions in my opinion - my first impression of this game was that it was lack luster. The graphics I thought looked like crap compared to other games like battlefield one, Until dawn, and so on. I thought the controls were stupid - I can't jump, the enemy aiming initially felt bad and confusing. I couldn't even customize the button actions to make it all better and had to adapt to what the game forced me to use and that led to an intial frustrating experience as I struggled to dodge, block, hit enemies and even just general movement across the starting area lead to death from falls off cliffs and unexpected enemies. And the game gives you no breaks, you can't even pause in the game which is what I'm used to. If I want to take a break I just press the pause button, but not in this game you have to be in a safe zone if you want to rest or just plain quit the game ( and there is a special menu option for you to quit , you can't just hit the PS4 button and close the app ). So yes, the game doesn't leave a good first impression, but if you can push past that and give it a few hours, defeat the first boss, learn the controls and start getting better weapons and understand the upgrade system, you start to be able to appreciate what this game has to offer and I think it's a rare thing to have quality RPG games like this. It is genuinely addictive. Gameplay: It's hard to explain the game play without experiencing it yourself. Watch a few game review videos if you want an idea, but the gist of it is that it's not a button mashing game. It's a third person RPG that requires enemy targeting and some level of strategy. Every enemy can be a challenge and has the ability to kill you if you are carelessly swinging. You need to know their attack patterns and know when to attack and if you're really into it, what to use for attacking that works most effectively. It's casual enough that you can just jump right in but not so casual that you can just hack and slash your way through the entire game ( if you're new ). Besides that, the game offers a pretty unique way to level up, but the stat adjustments are typical of the genre but with a twist here since the game has unique attributes associated with each stat. There are no skill branches, just attributes, weapons, armor, weapon/armor upgrades, spell purchases, but it's varied enough that you can have near unlimited choices to make the character you want. And the game can be as hard or as difficult as you want it to be depending on the time you spend upgrading/leveling. Game progression: The game progression itself is rather linear with forks in the quest line that you can choose to do and affect outcomes at different parts of the game with NPCs and game endings, but it's done so well that you never mind that it's linear since there is enough freedom that it makes the player feel they have control of what they want to do next. There are enough things players can do and side areas to explore if they so please. Basically it has an open world feel in terms of side quests vs main storyline but the map areas are pretty closed with hidden and optional areas but the level designs are so well done ( the best I've ever seen ) that I rather prefer that than exploring a boring barren open world. Boss battles: If you're looking for epic boss fights then this is the right game for you. The fights can be brutal but impressive and no two bosses behave the same way or have the same attacks. They are enjoyable and I hesitate a little every time I see the door that could lead to the next boss fight because I just don't know what to expect. Game replay value: I am only going through this game my first time and I'm hooked. The game does have a lot of replay value , different endings, new game difficulty after your first run, and different faction enlistments , different character attributes /customizations / weapons armor you may want to try, and quest lines that could have been missed the first time around, npcs you may want to kill etc. the game is brilliantly designed so it never really gets old even if you revisit an old level. It will offer hundreds of hours gameplay if you choose no doubt. Even just one play through will probably require at least weeks or months to complete if played casually about a few hours a day. The game levels / areas are deceptively huge. They feel large and natural and will take time to explore if you don't have maps or a game guide.",5,3,0,959,3956,90,1312,36,12,64.06,10.94,7.34,14.41

Buyer beware that this game takes no prisoners-- you will be tested to the utmost within the first 10 minutes of game play.

"This entry to Souls series is up there with the best of them. The transition in terms of gameplay from Souls to Bloodborne was jarring, however, going from BB to DS3 was smoother than I had expected. The gameplay, at its heart, is what you would expect from a Souls game, but the pacing in combat takes a few queues from Bloodborne with its faster than normal DS combat and seemingly quick transition from strike to strike. The world design is leaps better than DS2 with a feeling that a world was created and not a bunch of individual levels tied together in a mishmash. The world is not as interconnected as DS1 with areas looping around on each other, but that hasn't bothered me much as it reminds, in a sense, of Demon's Souls.

"So this is a mixed review for sure, Spyro 1 played great and Saved everytime without issue. It also has a Manual Save Option that allows you to save when you want. The 2nd and 3rd Games rely solely on Auto Save and it DOES NOT WORK! I played to 27% in Spyro 2, when I shut off my Xbox to play another game it said it had SAVED. When I reinserted the Disc and tried to continue my Saved Game the save amount had dropped from 27% to 9%, HOURS of effort were not SAVED, I had to start over again. The same thing happened with Spyro 3 and the Auto Save feature. Activision has not addressed this (and they were recently sold to Bungie) so who knows when it will be resolved if ever. I paid full price and can only use 1/3 of the game. It's a waste of time and Money. Poor Product, I do not recommend this game at all due to faulty Auto Save.

"I consider myself to be well-versed in platformer/Metroidvania games. The Metroidvania is my favorite genre of game and is the genre I play the most often. The pixel art and animations are very pretty and fluid. The music and atmosphere are also wonderful. The story is interesting. From my understanding, this game takes place before the others in the series. I am heavily considering playing the other games in the series to pick up the story. I think this game is good, but some aspects rub me the wrong way. I think this game is a tad too difficult. There's a fine line between a fun challenge and an aggravating one; Momodora RutM crosses that line for me. Here are a few reasons I think this game is frustratingly difficult: 1) Enemies, especially bosses, can completely drain health in three or four hits, whereas it takes many more to take them down. When fighting bosses, I felt like I couldn't make even one mistake, because one mistake can easily take out half of my health in less than a second. I'd often reset the save if I made any mistakes during boss fights because I knew there was no way I could recover from it. The combat is woefully unbalanced. 2) Saving points are rather scarce, which can make dying in some situations very annoying. 3) The controls are not as responsive or 'tight' as other Metroidvanias I have played. There have been many times where my character does something else other than what I wanted to do. I've never had this problem with other Metroidvanias on the Switch (e.g. Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, etc.). 4) I cannot find any option in the menus to lower the difficulty. As far as I can tell, you choose your difficulty at the very beginning and that's it. Maybe there is a way to lower the difficulty. but I can't find it. I don't want to sound like I hate this gameI don't. I still think it's worth picking up if you like Metroidvanias.

"I grew up as a SEGA Fanboy. I had everything from Game Gear all the way through Dreamcast. I thought for sure SEGA would win the console wars. Sadly, I was wrong. SEGA then decided to release some of their old titles in multiple collections throughout the years. This all started with the classics on Genesis. It seems that since then almost every SEGA system has had a SEGA Collection. Even PC got a few. When I found out that the PS4 was getting a SEGA Collection, it was a hard decision for me. I already purchased the PS3 collection and got most of the trophies. Did I really want to sink money into a PS4 collection? Here's how SEGA gets you. They release these collections with different combinations of games. You are always missing a game or two that are epic, but not represented in the latest collection. What's more is that this is essentially a PS4 port of Steam's SEGA Collection with a few games in and a few games out. So on to the product. You start in a game room. All the Genesis games are on a shelf in alphabetical order. You choose the game and watch an animation of it slid into the Genesis. It's charming at first, but after playing the @tGames Sega Systems, I miss just clicking on an option and launching the game. In addition to the library of games, there are challenges for most games. For Virtua Fighter, you have to win a match while starting with only 30% health and 1 round lost. Unless you've played the game religiously, there's very little chance of completing this challenge. There are also trophies for a chunk of the games. Some are as simple as collecting a number of potions in Golden Ax to reaching a certain chapter in Shining Force. What bothers me about the trophies is that some seem too daunting to be worth the effort. DO I really want to play through Shining Force until I reach that chapter? What if it's not my style of game? New to SEGA Collections is the Fast Forward and Rewind options. You can use the shoulder buttons to rewind a game to a previous point to undo a mistake. You can also increase the game speed to skip through cutscenes, text, or other portions of the game you would like to shorten. The game library is the 'largest yet'. While true, the question is whether you'll find something you like. The core games are split as follows: RPG's, Strategy, Beat'em Ups, and Platformers. If you like more than 1 of those genres, you'll find something worth your time. There are also several Genesis ports of arcade titles. Altered Beast is represented as a Genesis game in this collection (while you could unlock the arcade version in the PS3 edition). Then there are games (like Flicky) that are fun for a moment, but obviously products of their time. Overall, I enjoy this collection. The ability to play online makes it great for those rainy days (or if you just want to relive your childhood online with a friend). With over 50 games, I would recommend this.",3,3,0,543,2309,48,758,41,6,75.3,6.05,6.97,8.83
"The biggest positive I can give this collection is that you can play many of the titles online with friends if you want to, but this collection to me falls short of the PS3/Xbox 360 collection. For starters Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles are missing this go around. Also most of the Sega Collections previously also gave you arcade versions of some of the games or even Sega Master System like Phantasy Star. The other problem is it is missing the game manuals. I actually liked having that in the previous releases more than say mirror mode and I have finished almost all of the challenges already. Only like two are super ridiculous and the rest fairly easy. The second Golden Axe Challenge gave me a really hard time while the first and third one I completed in one go. Even beating the first box in Streets of Rage with max health is not that difficult. Now if you do not own any of the prvious collections, then this collection will likely be a big bonus. For me though it is a light version of so many of my previous collections at this point.",3,3,1,197,850,20,282,10,9,65.74,8.98,8.07,11.94
"This compilation has a greater number of classic Genesis games than previous console compilations, but a few things might give you pause: * The main menu is clunky and slow, and completely unnecessary. Set in a pre-rendered early-90's teenager's game room, you'll have to slowly navigate from the TV to the Genesis, or to the window, or to the stereo, or finally to the bookshelves where the games reside. * Once you get to the games on the shelf, you can only see the box spines. Who wants to just look at the box spines? Give us the front cover box art! * And there lights affixed to the shelves, which means any of the box spines not directly under a light are almost completely black and illegible. Seriously? * As for the emulation, it's pretty good. The audio sounds off in places, but it is notoriously hard to properly emulate Genesis sound. The only major gripe with the emulation is with the fast-forward and rewind functionality, which is accompanied with an ugly 80's/90's VCR vertical hold filter - that you cannot turn off! If you can look past these shortcomings, I would recommend this collection.",3,1,0,201,879,30,302,11,9,61.18,9.27,8.29,13.28

"If I was just reviewing the games lineup and the emulation Id probably rate this game 5 stars. Yes, there are a few notable ommissions but no compilation is ever perfect. What I cant forgive is the complete lack of in-game instruction manuals. No way should I have to look up games online and then adapt the control schemes to my PS4 controller buttons.",3,1,0,65,284,8,93,4,8,69.3,7.63,8.07,11.42
"Good deal on a nice selection of Sega Genesis games for your PS4, and some nice additions over the PS3 edition. No Sonic 3, no Sonic & Knuckles, which is a little disappointing.",4,1,0,32,139,5,49,2,8,61.05,8.72,7.89,12.65
"This was a great pickup. It feels like you are back in the 90s playing your favorite Sega games. When you go to the opening menu it's set up as a bedroom and you play the games on a 90s tv. You can change background settings, make a game a favorite, and rewind part of the game if you die or miss something important. You are not just picking and playing a game but it gives you that feeling of being a kid again.",5,1,0,85,322,4,107,5,5,83.08,5.89,4.73,8.68
"Frankly I found this collection to be unplayable. There are constant audio glitches and stuttering as well as really bad input lag. I'm playing on a PS4 Pro, so I don't know how it runs on other consoles, but this is just terrible. I feel cheated.",1,1,0,48,194,7,69,4,4,73.04,6.05,5.5,10.63

"From Sonic to Streets of Rage, you get a lot of bang for your buck. Including a 3D interactive game room instead of a generic menu with the list of titles was a great design choice. Online gameplay is also present for those interested. A few game-changing features are also implemented like a rewind/fast-forward button and being able to customize the TV screen HUD. Only gripe involves the rewind feature being too slow and imprecise to undo significant changes in use.",5,1,0,84,381,10,135,5,9,53.82,9.93,9.11,11.48

"This is a very fully featured Monopoly game for the Switch. The game features the classic boards in addition to some graphically snazzy boards (including one featuring Ubisofts' Rabbids characters). The controls work great and the game uses all of the Switch's control options. Up to six players can play together on the same screen (either with individual controllers or by sharing the same controller). A great party game for families and friends. The only complaint I have is that some of the new style maps have considerable frame skipping when playing in docked mode. Portable mode appears to run much better.",4,2,0,103,500,15,160,7,9,60.48,8.48,10.73,11.71

"This is a fun rendition of Monopoly and makes for a speedier game vs the board game due to the automation. There are variations of the game to play for quicker sessions that dont take the massive commitment of playing a traditional game. The game kind of stalls out after playing awhile though due to lack of achievements and just turns into playing the game rather than having tasks to attempt to complete. If you love playing monopoly though it wont let you down.",4,1,0,84,378,8,120,4,11,64.66,9.46,9.25,12.21
"This game is more for older kids to adults.We enjoyed this game. Love that they have live boards to chose from as well.

Other than they they liked it as well.",4,1,0,55,223,3,69,5,4,89.54,3.5,5.35,6.58
"Overall, this game is amazingly addictive! Especially if you're already a fan of the original board game! With all the different ways to play, this game will definitely keep you playing for awhile! However, I wish there were more themed boards to play on... when you play the live boards, you only get a choice of three. A haunted theme, a city theme, and an amusement park theme. You can also play the game on the classic board as well! Another issue I've come across is the game crashing... it often does this when the auto-save feature isn't working (which is currently the only way to even save the game). Whenever the next player's turn arrives, there should be an icon in the upper right hand corner that indicates the game is saving... but sometimes this icon fails to appear during gameplay. If it does, the game is certainly bound to crash at some point during the game (unless you're lucky enough to get through it quicker). That's my only major issue with the game as a whole. Otherwise, it's a fun and addictive game to play! Especially with friends and/or family!",4,1,0,201,842,21,284,15,6,73.7,6.31,6.62,9.54
"A lot of people complained about the long loading times. I haven't had that issue. However games take very long to play. Waiting for the AI to move is like watching grass grow.

"I LOVE Monopoly. I collect both physical and video games. I have played many versions of Monopoly and this Nintendo Switch version sucks. It is very boring and a little difficult to play. The reason it is difficult is because you can't actually see the board when making choices. I tried it a few times and have now put it away to just 'collect.'

When I used to play it on a board my electricy bill was only 1 dollar. But since playing monopoly on my tv and this 'console' My electric went up 100.

"I bought this game so my son and I could play a fighting game (and because Street Fighter isn't on the XBox One) and it's a good time. I started off button mashing and having some pretty good results, but as he actually practiced it didn't take long for him to catch up to my mashing abilities. The graphics are nice (as you'd expect from this generation of consoles and games) and the action is as high speed or as stealthy as you are a fighter. A lot of the fighters are familiar from the multitude of Mortal Kombats before it so I didn't come in unaware, but they have new moves, new sequences, and background interactions that give it some depth. Like all fighting games, it gets a little repetitive after awhile, but it's still a good game that's easy to get into and takes some time to master. Her'es a little hint that my son failed to share with me until later into the game: you can see all the combo moves and finishing moves by pressing the menu button at any time.",4,0,1,193,767,12,260,6,14,60.22,12.85,6.65,15.35

Not quite as good as the sum of its parts, but an excellent romp and one of the best JRPGs in years. Gameplay has you working your way through labyrinthine dungeons, much like in the last few Persona games, with your team of magically inclined teenagers. Fights are turn-based and fluid, allowing you to get repeated advantages against enemy weaknesses, making for fun and flowing good times in battle. Atlus ingenuity plus Nintendo slickness. Story is predictable but fun, pitting your cast of heroes, all of whom are actors or models or singers, etc, against evil demons that want to steal our artistic inspiration. Silly but very enjoyable. Not quite the next Persona or Megami Tensei, but an excellent game in its own right that completely stands up solo. Very recommended.",4,1,0,167,786,26,261,10,10,57.67,9.36,10.1,12.91

"Having sunk 20 hrs into it, can say that despite the really fun way the battle system works (chaining your party member attacks together into larger combos based off of Fire Emblem style enemy weapon/elemental weaknesses) I can unfortunately see why it didnt sell well when first released on WiiU in 2015. Lots of the game just has straight up bad design choices in it that feel like padding made to stretch out sections of the game. While that's HARDLY a new concept in an RPG experience, it's quite awful here. At the very bottom of this review I'll post my take on what a typically awful side quest feels like. How are the dungeons? They're pretty linear, with little offshoots. They would be 'fine' if not for how confusing (some) get, but only because everythiiiiing looks the same in the dungeon, that by the you reach the section of most dungeons you dont know where anything is (like oh yeah I have to backtrack and flip that switch on the mannequin, or jump off that ONE ledge...but it all ends up blurring together). Also, the amount of backtracking the game asks you (not talking Metroidvania-like or anything), just to find a glowing sparkle on the ground OR to just continue a conversation (in a sidequest) is embarrassing for a game of this supposed caliber. However the battle system is a total joy. The boss battles are difficult but not cheap and defeating them is bliss. Not a terrible game but just feels c-list in effort and c-list budget. Good music though. *Here's an example of a typical awful sidequest: 'meet me here.' You meet them there. They tell you the absolute most generic cliched little story about them possible. 'Ok. lets do this.' They disappear, you take 2 steps, get a text. They say 'meet me here (or worse yet, guess where i am).' You teleport to the general area and walk to them, of course waiting to cross a road along the way. Then they talk to you, via an in-engine cutscene. 'Ok.' They disappear again. You walk 2 steps, get another text, 'meet me where we just were before this.' Open map, teleport, walk over to them. HOLD DOWN X TO SKIP ANYTHING THEY'RE SAYING, GUESS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE DIALOG. 'ok, meet me at an area we were at 2 steps ago.' Then you'll have the final cutscene BUT make sure you go to Tiki IMMEDIATELY afterward, before doing anything else.' Games makes sure you have to also walk thru the SAME office again for the 100th before going into the Tiki room, instead of just immediately taking you there. Apply this pattern to everyone NOT in the main battles.",2,1,5,467,1978,50,666,31,7,70.89,7.11,7.14,10.31
"Shadow of the Colossus was the exemplar of how video games could be treated as art back in 2005. Between the music, visuals, gameplay, and minimalistic yet stunningly deep narrative SotC proved that games were more than mere entertainment. They could make you think and feel; they could move the audience through an interactive media in a way that people had not previously engaged with art. These sentiments are still true today, 13 years after the original was released. Shadow of the Colossus in 2018 is not just an update or HD remaster. This is a ground up re-make that retains the full spirit and experience of the original while giving a modern audience the kind of fluid controls and sharp visuals that we have become used to. This is how re-makes should be handled. This game has been crafted by people who understood what made the original so memorable, and who obviously worked extremely hard to retain that magic.

However, you usually have to climb on them but the process will have you on the edge of your seat all the way through.",5,1,0,80,344,9,111,4,9,69.15,8.58,8,12.5
"This game is the exact remake of the original, but with a graphical overhaul and performance upgrades --Here are a list of changes to the game: 1. Graphics. Unlike the PS3 Remaster, this version does not only have graphical up scaling, but also new renders and slight remodels of the environment, characters and colossi. A night-and-day difference; the major change you'll notice in this version as you can now see detailed in the rock formations, strains of grass and individual hairs in the Collossi. The Dynamic lighting effects in this game are amazing and is the best I've seen in any game thus far. There's also reactive foliage and water physics to get you more engrossed into the world 2. Constant Frame Rate. Unlike the choppy inconsistent frame rate of original, this game has smooth frame rate throughout. If you have a PS4 Pro you can play at 60FPS at 1080p (performance mode) or 30FPS at 4K (cinematic mode) Standard PS4 runs at constant 30FPS at 1080p 3. Controls. The core gameplay is the same, but there are some quality of life changes added to make the control more modern (you can also opt for orginial controls for the purists out there). PS4 Touchpad brings up a map Jump is now the X button instead of Triangle Dodge/Roll is the Circle button instead of R1 + Triangle 4. Game now saves automatically. Praying altar no longer serves as manual save terminal in-game and only heals Wander when activated. 5. Photo mode You can pause and take pictures at any time and add filters similar to other first party exclusives like Uncharted and Horizon Zero Dawn 6. Gallery Collection of digital pictures filled with comparison shots and concept art 7. New Game+. This time around you can select different difficulty settings instead of sticking the one you beat the game with. There's also Mirror Mode and Time Trails. 8. Trophy Support You can now earn PSN trophies (when comparing to PS2). Compared to the PS3 version; there's 7 more additional trophies you can collect bringing the total to 38 vs 31. PSN considers them different games so if you own the PS3 version you can stack trophies --What Stayed the Same: -Story. You go to this alter and try to resurrect a fallen princess. You are told in order to do so, you have to defeat 16 Collossi roaming around the land. Then off you go and try to slay 16 of them in a series of boss battles; each of them different in size and ways to take them down. Story isn't that deep at face value, but through gameplay, you'll get a deep moral understanding/emotion investment of the world especally when you reach closer and closer to the end game. -There are some returning issues with the game like how your horse does what it wants at random times and camera issues when in narrow corridors. For those who only play modern games the character controls may feel a bit stiff and clunky at first, but you'll get used to it if you keep at it as there is a learning curve to the character's movement. -Sound is spectacular as always. The colossi roars are more distinct this time around (either that or I have a better headset this time around). Still no English voice acting, just random gibberish coming from characters Overall, best way to experience the Shadow of The Colossus if you haven't played it before, and an excellent revisit with enhanced visuals for those who did.",5,1,0,604,2659,71,883,33,9,64.58,8.8,8.47,12.02
"Shadow of The Colossus is often considered a 'MUST PLAY' for anyone who considers themselves a fan of video games, and is similarly cited as one of the shining examples of games as art. While the aesthetic design, musical score, and just overall presentation of this game is absolutely stellar; the game shows its Playstation 2 era roots with somewhat clunky controls and decidedly oldschool design choices. For any potential buyers who don't know what this game is, I would stress that it is much more of a puzzle game than an action game. Each colossus feels like a puzzle you solve rather than a beast you fight like in a typical action game. The quality is there in this game, I just didn't particularly enjoy it, and I would encourage any potential buyers to research what they're getting into before purchasing.",3,1,0,145,659,22,221,5,15,48.46,13.7,9.9,17.67
"Ive wanted to play Shadow of the colossus ever since it was released on the PS2 and never got around to it. I figured with the HD remake it was the perfect time to play it. Im halfway through the game and im pretty disappointed, its a boring, repetitive game. I knew what I was getting into and thought a game comprised of only boss fights sounded great. Yeah, not so much. All the bosses are very similar and theres not much else to do in the game.",2,1,0,88,353,7,123,6,5,73.7,6.62,5.77,9.05
"Game is pretty and the music is beautiful, but the controls made me want to throw my controller at the screen. Everything is needlessly complicated or not nearly optimized. Gameplay is boring as well and repetitive. This is one of the most overrated games I've ever played. Don't believe the hype and make the same mistake I did.",2,1,0,60,264,9,91,5,6,66.35,6.99,7.61,10.8
"So you're basically just riding around on a horse all the time doing pretty much nothing... there are 16 bosses in the game.. and that is the only actual game play. Like there is seriously NOTHING ELSE in this game. If you weren't riding around on a horse doing nothing you could beat this game in maybe 2 hours of actual game play. I can't believe I paid for this.",2,1,0,73,284,4,99,6,3,79.75,5.16,4.64,7.06

"The graphics are amazing, such was the draw to the game in first place. The reason it is not great is the controlled movements in game play are not as responsive as i would like. Another kind of annoying feature is the game makes you look at what it wants when looking around. You can of course look at your surroundings by taking control of the view but as soon as you hand comes off the button, it reverts back to what it wants you to see. The actual movemnts when on horseback look amazing however controlling it leaves something to be desired.",3,1,0,103,438,10,138,5,9,72.58,8.25,7.77,12.12
"It probably depends on whether or not you have played the original Shadow of the Colossus. I have never played the original and I was not impressed with the overall gameplay (just killing giant colossus creatures over and over).

"In Shadow of the Colossus you play as the wanderer seeking to bring his love interest back to life. In order to do so you must defeat 16 different Colossus. What sets this game apart is the sheer size of the Colossus themselves. They tower over your character and defeating them consists of climbing onto the monster, locating and attacking their weak spot until they're defeated. There isn't anything else to do in the game besides this. The pacing of the game can drag as the world, although beautiful, is void of any characters.",3,1,0,96,427,14,141,6,8,66.34,7.98,8.5,12.23
"I have never played the original game on the PS2 or the remastered on the PS3 but, over the years I have always heard of this game and/or seen it mentioned in the media and content that I consume on a daily basis. I have always heard of how this game and of how it influenced the production and artistic direction of a lot of future games,movies, and media and how much impact this game had in inspiring future projects. Now after getting my hands on the remake and after playing it, I see why this game was ever praised to begin with. If I could compare this game to other media like movies or music, this would be one of the many epics of the gaming world, just like LOTR is to movies or Bach is to music, this game is a classic. I don't want to make it sound like I am on the bandwagon hype just because this game got re-released (which truthfully, I was) and I just wanted to be part of the crowd. You might be thinking (as I also did at a time) that this game was just over-rated and that this game only served to please a niche genre to a niche group of people that just couldn't let this game go, but considering the fact that this game got released on the world's most purchased console, up against other great games of its time, this game had its moment and it should of just faded into one of many games that came out long ago and in the end should of be forgotten, yet this one managed to stand the test of time and still manages to be an epic game in today's standards, this game deserves all the praise it has gotten then, and all its getting now.",5,1,0,315,1223,14,407,6,24,44.24,20.13,6.47,22.78
"I have to agree with the other not so great reviews. This game just is not that much fun. You do the same thing over and over and struggle doing it because the controls are so wonky. I gave it a 3 star because fighting the colossi can be enjoyable, if only for a few minutes, and the graphics and landscape are really well done. I finished the game only because I paid $40 for it.",3,1,2,76,297,3,101,5,5,78.98,6.02,5.23,7.66
"This game, this beautiful masterpiece, has and always will be my all time favorite game. From the soundtrack, to the ambient noises as you travel, to the most epic soundtrack ever, this games always makes me cry and get so many goosebumps cause of it's sheer awe. It never fails to amaze me and I always have so much fun playing the game. I've spent countless, COUNTLESS, hours playing this game ever since I was 12 and I still play it to this day religiously. February 6th, bring it on baby.",5,21,39,93,387,7,127,5,8,72.43,7.78,7.08,10.45
"I don't usually write reviews, but this game is so bad that I felt inspired to write one. I hope to save some people a few bucks. I know there are alot of good reviews out there on this game. I am baffled by that. I have to believe that those people did not play the whole game. I believe they must have only played the first couple of monsters. Because up to that point, the game was somewhat acceptable. And the nice visuals might have overwhelmed them. But if they continued playing they would find that this game violates almost every rule of good gaming - and some that I didn't even know could be violated. It does have a couple redeeming qualities: It looks good; and it has some cool monsters. But that is where it ends. The game play is awful, the navigation is awful, the controls are awful, the repetitiveness is awful, the map is awful, the story is awful, and the ending is awful. The game kept taking me to new heights of aggravation. If the controls and navigation had been good, then the game would have taken about 5 hours to beat. So it feels like they intentionally made the controls and navigation bad so that it would take longer to finish the game. That is a bad mistake. I would rather have had fun for five hours, than aggravated for 20 hours. I could write a book about all the flaws in this game, but to save time, let me just focus on one issue as an example: The Navigation. The game gives you three tools to help with that: A sword (which points to your destination), a horse (to travel on), and a map. All three of them suck. The sword points you in a general direction, but once you get close, or get in the mountains, or the woods, it fails. It usually leads you to a location where you have a few choices (like go left around the mountain, go right around the mountain, or go down a path thru the mountain). There is nothing telling you which path to take, and usually taking what looks like the logical path does not get you there. And in fact takes you a long way that often ends in a dead end, where there is no way to go but back out the way you came so you can try another option. Its like getting thru a maze without an overhead view of the maze - because the map is worthless. I have never seen such a worthless map. And on top of that, navigating back out thru the woods or thru the mountain on your horse is painful because the controls while riding the horse are so terrible. I often found myself quitting the game and restarting from the staring location, just so I wouldn't have to navigate back out and circle back around on the horse. I could go on and on about other flaws in the game. But I hope this gives you a sufficient taste. I post this bad review because it is getting so many good reviews, and I hate so see game developers encouraged to keep producing bad games. So if you are considering this game, please be sure to read other review out here. I'm not the only one trying to warn you. Good luck, and enjoy your (other) gaming!",1,6,25,577,2333,36,758,34,7,78.47,6.53,6.23,9.28
"The Switch port of Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age is in decent shape. In handheld mode, the image is definitely blurrier than any other release, including the base Xbox One version. I have posted a comparison between the Switch Handheld version and the PC version (in 1080p), but keep in mind that it will always look crisper on the actual Switch screen than it will on a screenshot. The frame rate is limited to 30fps (which is true for all other versions except for PC/Xbox One X) but it seems to be stable. The Switch/Xbox One ports come with some new features that the PS4/PC versions do not have. They are: -Licencse Reset, which allows you to switch jobs at will (acquired less than an hour into the story) -Additional Gambit sets. Gambits allow you to manipulate party AI, and this new set feature allows you to create up to 3 different sets of Gambits and switch between them at will. -An improved New Game+ that lets you start at level 90 and carry over weapons, magic and gil With these new features, along with the portability of the Switch, it is hard not to recommend this as the definitive version. The blurriness is definitely notable to me, as I have played the PC version as well, but in this case the good heavily outweighs the bad. P.S. Oh, and the title screen appears to have some input lag not found in the PC version. If this is a bad first impression, worry not. I tested everything past the title screen",5,11,1,266,1130,20,373,14,9,68.92,8.37,7.62,10.61
"I'm so happy I got this!! I never got to finish this the first time around for a couple of reasons... The main one being because even though at the time I enjoyed the look and style of this entry... I wasn't the biggest fan of the newer battle/exploration mechanics because I hadn't really played any MMORPG games yet that FFXII is similar to. I also had NO IDEA what length/size of an adventure I was getting myself into! ...But now I can chip away at this gorgeously crafted game anytime anywhere and it didn't take me long to fly by where I stopped the first time. It's great to hear a fully fleshed out orchestral soundtrack paired with improved visuals but the best thing about this version is the new (and very customizable) job system. I will probably get daggers thrown at me for this (and trust me, this has taken a lot of thought on my end as I am very much a single-digit FF fan) but this might be my new favorite in the series!",5,2,0,186,733,13,254,9,8,70.33,8.58,5.94,11.06
"Final Fantasy XII is my favorite Final Fantasy game, mainly because of the art style and world-building. Final Fantasy XII is a super long game, and one that I never thought would be brought to Switch, but now there are four mainline (more if you count X-2 and XV Pocket Edition) Final Fantasy games on Switch. The port of XII was done by Virtuos, who did an awesome job with both the port of XII to the Switch as well as X/X-2 HD Remaster to the Switch.

"When the original Burnout Paradise came out in 2008, I bought it and had a blast playing it. After 10 years, it finally arrives to the PS4 and Xbox One. Is it worth buying for New and Veteran players? Yes*, but there are some caveats that I need to address. I'll start with the Positives first. With this remastered, it comes with all the DLCs and Updates on the disc. So, you will get the additional cars, online modes, and even an additional Island to play and race with. Secondly, the controls are very tight and the physics for all the vehicles handle great and different. The game runs natively 1080P 60FPS on both the PS4 and Xbone and also 4k 60FPS if you have the performance versions of these consoles. However, I will now address the cons for this game. While the graphic does look slightly cleaner and polished, it's not much of a bigger difference from the PS3 to PS4. Also, some of the gameplay aspects has not aged that well. For example, if you are not familiar with the map yet, you will be constantly pausing the game and look at the map to make sure you are heading to the right direction. Next, like many modern racing games you can set a waypoint or have some form of fast travel to reduce the monotony. However, in this game you have to manually drive to all the locations, and without putting a custom waypoint, it goes back to my 1st issue. Lastly, if you wanted to change to a new car you have to drive back to the Junkyard each time and then wait for the vehicle to load and then select it. These issues are annoying at worst to a minor inconvenience at best. Overall, despite some of these issues the game is still fun and if you are a new racer or a returning veteran that likes to take a turn on Memory Lane, then pick up this game. The game has a lot of things to do and you can easily spend hundreds of hours playing this game.",4,4,0,356,1462,35,487,19,8,72.09,7.86,6.77,11.43
"I assuming most players have already play the game on the old version but I will write my review for those who might be first timers on the game. first of all the game is super fun, it is just amazing I could say with all my honesty that is probably not the best racing game on ps4 but is for sure the most fun to play its the best on just racing and free roaming and do whatever you want in the city, only action, without story missions or cops or any career and that staff. The way that the cars moving in this game with all the speed and almost unlimited nitro and real trashing up the car scenes, it can blow your mind away. It has some fictional but still very awesome cars and the races and challenges can be just incredible. as for the remaster , I hadnt finish the game on ps3 but I have played a few times and I can say that game is very improved , for the graphics , for the sound effects , for the mechanics . It does not look like a brand new game but it is still much better that the old version. I give it 8 ,1 point for the graphics which are okay but not the best and 1 point because I play it for 4 days I have almost reach the end of the game , so its kind of short to me . In general is a MUST have game for anyone who just love racing games.",5,1,0,257,980,14,325,8,13,67.24,11.86,5.7,15.03

I do wish they would have brought back the destructive mode that was featured in the PS2 release, 'Burnout: Revenge' where you accumulate points by causing the most damage to the vehicles in the surrounding area in one launch. Other than that missing feature, this game has already provided me with hours upon hours of entertainment.

"Burnout Paradise released back in 2008 on PS3 & X360 and it was a game I thoroughly enjoyed. Stunts, crashes, takedowns and much more was on offer in this beautiful racer. A tight and very responsive racer, this game also introduced a huge open world to drive around in both offline and most importantly online with your friends. A little off putting at first because the developers didn't give you a waypoint. They gave you a compass and on the minimap a destination. It was your responsibility to find the quickest route. But this design decision was a solid one. It necessitated learning the map and shortcuts. Now EA has finally released a remaster of this title and on PS4 Pro and a 4K/HDR capable tv this is a sight to behold.

I was waiting for the price to finally come down, when it did I snatched it up. A BEST BUY CSR left me know that on the 22nd of December the DLC content would be on sale, as this CSR was an ARK owner/fan. Instead of the full 80.00 dollar cost for the FULL DLC - SEASON PASS content price I got the FULL SEASON PASS DLC on the PS Store for only 30.00. Each DLC that is released is said to have over 300 additional hours of play. Not all has been released yet but they're a couple available. Scorched earth is our favorite as my son and I are Dragon lovers. I collected pewter dragons, anything dragon when I was young and into my teenage years. Now my son has my collection plus we have started his own collection. Scorched earth is full of ALL KINDS OF DRAGONS, and you can tame them, ride them, etc. I will say scorched earth isn't very easy, even if on easy. This game reminds me of Minecraft but a more realistic life like version with better options. It isn't easy to survive, but I recommend looking up survival startup guides on youtube, this will help a lot.

Sadly, private or single player for the most fun. Once you start taming rexs and spinos theres really no challenge or much left to do in it without mods, the game just becomes farmesvill or harvestmoon. If you join tribes becareful of their rule sets as they can claim your dinos/gear/mats/land/buildings when you join, if you leave your SOL. If you see it on sale for like 30 bucks I'd say go for it.

"In Beta game was a blast except for the updates 3 times a day.... now that its released they down for about 1 update a day. Here is the problem now..... If you want to play and have tech support you cant play on a'legacy' server so that forces everyone to play on a official. Well at launch and for the next month or so the servers were all full. So you can even get in, now only weekends are full so dont plan on playing then. The big kicker now is they limit the number of tamed dinos a server can have.... the personal tame limit is like 600 when the server tame limit is like 4000. what does this mean? well it means that like 5-6 people on a 70 person server can cap it out and they did. I have around 10 dinos.... i went to tame more and it wont let me because other people have 400+ so now everyone on server (ragnarok 71) is stuck doing nothing. and tons of people tryin to transfer so the last few new servers are capping. so unless you can play on a private server with friends i wouldnt play this if they paid me.",1,1,1,208,785,7,264,14,4,84.38,5.18,4.4,7.29

"This is the old Hot Shots Golf series on PS2, PS3 many loved it is the same studios Clapz handz and Sony Japan. We finally get an arcade golf with DEEP campaign solo and online modes...After what-3,4 years...some may be tirned off by the very Japanese aspct of the game which I mean by that the games here are not straight ports from Japan like this one so for little kids much of the english translation is awkward and the game definetly has a silly anime approach that if you dont follow that genre it comes off as odd and stupid. So understand it is a straight port but nothing is chaged from the Hot Shots of old-this is GREAT ARCADE pick up and play Golf BUT has Vasttly DEEP solo campaign if you want to get a year out of your 20 dollar. YOu cant beat it. I have always felt Hot Shots golf was the must underrated Playstation series leading up to this ridiculous 4 year wait for another next Gen game finally. Will probably be the last entry we ever get here in the Us if they even make another period. Buy it bc when the next one comes out it will be on Playstation 6 and you may be dead by then anyway. Best sports series by far for quick OR hours of ginding if you like simple yet infuriating later in the game difficulty playing CPU challnges head to head. Rewarding to beat the characters in stroke play like the Hot Shots of old to unlock the different Golfer Bosses. Why this is not a YEARLY game when it is so easy to rinse, repeat the engine, models it is a easy cheap production but one of the best sports games of all-time as a series for kids and 80 year olds (I am not 80 but an 80 could play this due to the fantastic simple one button arcade style if you wish so). It is 20 dollars buy it now and thank me later. Im positive we won't get another entry.",5,1,0,355,1398,25,468,14,10,69.57,9.86,6.19,12.96

The character creator gives you a lot of freedom, and you can change your name or how you look at any time, so there's no pressure to create the 'perfect' character off the bat (unlike so many other games). The actual gameplay is easy to pick up, but super fun. There are a lot of small RPG elements to keep things interesting (clubs level up, you can buy items, there's an overworld for you to explore), and the game itself is brimming with charm.

After playing less then one round this game was placed back in its case and every attempt will be made to return it or sell it to somebody looking for a non-golfers golf game.

"Battlezone has a great co-op campaign story but it s not innovative. That s where i take a star out because it does amazing things but there is a little issue. The maps look practically the same. It would have been better if the devs were projecting 3 or 4 different maps at least in variation but no the map look just the same. This game use procedural technology which means that the replay ability is amazing although be aware of the most frustrating rules that the devs implemented for gamers that just started. 1. if all your team mate and no chance to be revived anymore then you failed your entire campaign. This is where it s frustrating because if you just started the game for the first time, it will be difficult. Also the mechanics of the game aren't well explained. For example they do not mention that if you stay close to your friends it will heal you automatically and regain your energy. A lot of players i play online with weren't aware for this regeneration. You are also dependent on other players which means that someone can screw your campaign for you to start all over again. 2. you do not keep your upgrades and you have to restart to accumulate your point to get them back.

For what it's meant to be without a doubt I started it up and played in 3hrs straight It has that magic Disney had during the late 80's early 90's It does get repetitive at a point but, let's be honest what game doesn't Being able to ride various rides kind of sucks and feels cheap But, playing various shorts, segments from Classic Disney animation/feature films is another high point You get to fall down the rabbit whole in Alice in Wonderland and play various moments in the film! Simply awesome but, too short The items you are given along the way expands the game play from taking selfie with Disney Characters, Fishing out items with a fishing poll, a Magic wand that brings items to life and a Buzz Light Year laser gun to name a few The Story is paper thin but, it's just mindless exploring and fun You are some kid running around alone in a theme park making manhole covers explode and bringing light posts to life where is this kids parents or the park security for that matter If you are old enough to vote or do other adults thing (Just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride) Graphics A+ super slick and polished This game should have been bundled with the XBox OneX for two big reasons it would be a solid tech demo and to draw a family audience into investing in a somewhat expensive gaming console Once in a great while the game does lag a bit mostly when you are doing multiple things around a crowd of people Audio is also top notch the DTS sounds good (almost all the characters sound right except Baloo from the Jungle Book/Tale Spin) This game is super impressive with sounds coming from all around you the detail is super impressive for a game like this Controls are easy to pick up and play (The only negatives with the controls is switching between various items from Camera phone to magic wand, etc. feels a bit clunky and off it should've been just tap the (R) button and items would switch on the fly Another small negative you can not run which makes the game seem a bit slow at times, the jump while going through the them park itself has no real reason (You can't jump over gates or small areas) Overall this is to some extend a must have launch title for the One X I had more fun with this then Assassins Creed Origins Unlike AC Origins this game doesn't have massive chunks of audio drop out whenever it feels like it If you want to relive your childhood it will surprise you and do a good job 8.5/10",5,12,0,585,2367,38,783,5,57,-25.15,45.83,7.74,49.4

I recommended to have watched KINGSGLAIVE movie before embarking on Final Fantasy XV, as it is a prequel to events of the game.",4,1,0,103,444,12,152,6,8,64.56,8.52,7.82,11.53

Different from past LEGO games this entry takes a page from the sandbox genre where you explore and find items to build the world around you. This may sound similar to past games but this time your breaking down objects in the world to find unique blocks to unlock patterns to build new objects that you can freely place around the world. Once you've found the requisite number of each blocks you can advance the story and move to a new area. It's fun to play and nice to see TT Games test out some new gameplay methods.

"Disclaimer, I bought the digital version from PSN. I am posting here to inform of my impressions. This game may be called Anime Souls and rightfully so. There are many aspects of the Souls/Bourne genres that blend well into the game. What is Souls/Bourne, well in short, it is an action RPG adventure game where you learn enemy patterns, fight large bosses, enemies respawn when you rest/heal, using a form of currency that is also XP that is derived from killing enemies that may be lost on player death with a limited time/lives to recover lost funds/XP. Pros: Sound: The music is atmospheric and appropriate. You are energized to fight large bosses or feel impending dread during normal grinding. Character Customization: You can create and later edit your character in many ways which also appear in cut scenes. Many hairstyles, accessories, eye types, voices, the combinations are endless to build your avatar. I think I spent nearly 30 minutes building how I want my character to look only to have the option to change her later. Blood gifts/abilities: You start with 3 main classes which can be switched at any time but you also gain others. You are not stuck with predetermined roles as you can master the skills and benefits of each class and blend them. Cons: The fighting: The game is a great action game with hack/slash mechanics. There are moments when your timing is perfect yet you cannot execute an attack. Another problem I had was the backstab attack. You will do more damage as well as have immunity and a unique action sequence, but there are times when the attack will not work when it should or I had 3 in a row when the monster should have died with the first, each subsequent attack doing no damage. This is a great game. There is some fan-service, essentially overly sexualized or exaggerated body sizes and skimpy outfits, but they are not as rampant or degrading as some publications would make them seem. Honestly, Misti from Pokemon is more risque than all the characters I have encountered so far. There could be more to the game, a little more in-depth RPG mechanic or more blood codes (classes), but it is a good entry into a Souls/Bourne-style game that is not as hard. The story so far is decent and has a good premiss but the main character is lacking, not just because there is no voice acting for them but they do not act quite the same as a normal person would. There is a demo, play it if you are on the fence but I highly recommend this game.",5,1,0,454,1980,47,651,22,10,64.58,9.38,8.41,12.4

"Resident evil 4 and 5 are superb 3rd person action 'horror' games with non stop tense close encounters, (Which INITALLY control clunky by modern standards.) If your not fan of having to make every round count and conserve all the healing and resource items you can, then odds are you will be disappointed with RE 4 and 5. RE4 is the full package including the alternate episodes after completing the game. As well as mercenaries. Same with RE5 (the download code in the box) seems to include all the old DLC and the better Version of the enjoyable 'mercenaries' mode. RE 5 and RE 6 have full online co-op support but require a Nintendo online membership to use. They also have offline split screen when the switch is docked but beware of the awkward cropping Capcom used to do to split the screen for local multiplayer. If you were to pay for these individually on the switch digital store I believe it totals at $90 so this multi pack (physical copy of 4 and download codes for 5 and 6) is a great deal. Also beware of the download size you will need aprox 18GB for RE5 and around 25GB for RE6.",5,3,0,203,871,18,288,9,11,63.92,9.95,8.12,12.57

"I expected this game to have a bunch of freezing and lag issues at certain points but it does not. I did notice a slight frame skip in the first stage of RE5 when there are numerous zombies on the screen at once, but not after that. Furthermore, being that it is Nintendo Switch online multiplayer, I expected the service to be poor quality at best like how Mario Maker 2 performs online. I didnt have any lag spikes at all during the entire RE5 campaign with my buddy (we havent played RE6 online yet). So, I am very satisfied with this port.

The biggest advantage this version has though, is that it's portable. Now you can play the game anywhere. Overall I had a good time, but it might be due to never playing these games before.

Yes, they added a bunch of microtransactions but nothing I feel actually hampers the enjoyment of the game without paying.

"I played Fallout 3 and 4 already and thought I would give New Vegas a shot (even though it's a bit old at this point). With Fallout 4 Bethesda (game developer) got criticized by critics and fans a like for having a weak story and a world where most interactions/quests involved shooting generic post-apocalyptic bandits. Fallout 4 is a great game but the actual role playing/world building part is very very weak. You could make similar comments about Fallout 3. In contrast Fallout New Vegas was made by Obsidian who are known for taking other people's games and making really interesting stories. In New Vegas your actions shape how various factions in the world perceive you and treat you, so what you do actually has consequences. Many of the quests and characters are memorable and well written. To give an example the other day I played a seemingly generic quest where I had to update some radio gear on behalf of a military officer. This led to a mystery about military reports that were clearly false. This ultimately led to a conversation with a really nice old man in the organization who eventually admitted that he thought his group was involved in a military mess (think Vietnam or Iraq) that was wasting a lot of young lives. He alluded to the fact that he was falsifying reports and undermining battle planning so that leaders back home would think things are hopeless and end the war. After confronting him I tell him I will have him arrested and he accepts this. Then when you leave his office he locks the door, apologizes to everyone over the loudspeaker for losing his way, and then shoots himself. I struggle to think of an interesting story like this in Fallout 4. If you like Bethesda games like Fallout or Elder Scrolls I highly recommend Fallout New Vegas. The graphics are pretty bad (they weren't even good when it first came out) but that's not stopping me from having fun.",5,1,0,342,1533,43,517,16,11,57.25,10.58,9.17,13.58

Now, THIS bad-boy right here, running backwards compatible through a regular Xbox One, is the complete opposite. It plays like a dream. Load screen times are clearly reduced, few if-any frame-drops, and it hasn't frozen once.

"Most reading this have probably played Fallout 3. If you haven't, grab that one as well! Both are worth every dollar spent. I won't go into the story too much, it's on the back of the box and there isn't much too it w/o spoiling it :) It follows the basic story telling and leveling mechanics as Fallout 3. You level by executing (and I say that because nothing is Better than a vats head shot!) enemies and leveling up. As you level, you are able to put points into a variety of skills from bartering to stealth. You are able to have a maximum 2 companions at once (one human one robotic). You cannot level them up, but they do level with you and each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Onto the DLC. I enjoyed most of them, three of the four to be exact. The story with the DLCs made it feel like they could of been thrown in with the vanilla version, which is expected. I hate DLCs that entirely change the feel of a game. You want more guns and head explosions, right? Yes. I didn't care for the Sierra madre DLC in the pack. It just seemed like an entire other team created it... It was overly dark and the story wasn't as engaging in my opinion... If you enjoyed fallout 3, or enjoy a great story telling RPG (and can deal with some glitches and quest bugs), this is probably the game for you. I played thru it twice, and for a game this large you can probably fit 50 hours into 1 play through... -AgtJ",5,1,0,279,1090,24,370,21,4,81.16,5.24,4.94,8.76

"I've played this series since the beginning and when this remastered version that includes 3 previous releases came out, I passed on buying it because, well, been there done that. But when it was announced they did a FREE PSVR update patch, I finally bought it and I gotta say, this game is now one of the best offerings for VR yet! You can sit inside the cockpit and feel the rush of speed as you race and it all looks really good. There's also options to go 3rd person but what's the point. This series has always been so fun but now, in VR it's better than ever. If you have a PSVR headset and you like super fast racing, get it! Highly recommended!",5,2,0,129,510,9,170,7,7,76.64,7.15,5.84,10.16
"With 3 remasters in the package, Wipeout Omega Collection is an amazing value. While 2 of the 3 are from last-gen PS3, Wipeout HD & Wipeout Fury, the final entry is from the handheld series, Wipeout 2049. 2049 shows off the largest difference, thanks to the bigger difference in format, all 3 have had a ton of love involved. Everything has been upgraded; this is NOT a nostalgia cash-in for those of us who grew up with the Wipeout series from its earliest days on PSX. Beyond the visuals, the game(s) runs at 60fps, and the controls, always smooth, are even moreso now. If you've never played Wipeout, you're in for a real treat. Atop including 3 games, with numerous tracks per game, each includes a plethora of vehicles to start, along with even more to unlock. Littered around the tracks are a variety of power ups to help you or hinder opponents, along with many boost pads that keep the pace at one of the fastest (still) in any racing series. Pulling off barrel rolls (always risky, as tracks that feature jumps aren't always very high jumps- timing is crucial,) will also grant your floating rocket a quick burst of speed. But all this speed comes at a price. Vehicles all have shields; and attempting to use walls to bounce back from a loss of control will deduct from them. Opponents firing at you will also cause damage- lose your shields and your ship, you'll have to rerun the race. Picking a favorite company to race for does not stick you with their vehicles, but that said, your best bet is to find a sponsor early that has a vehicle you can handle well. As you play, you'll earn loyalty points by the sponsor which, in turn, helps you unlock more vehicles from them. Constantly switching sponsors will delay getting into newer vehicles, but you're never 'locked in'. If a particular track gives you trouble, never hesitate to swap out, as each company seems to have a 'set path' of expertise- (some may have health & shield as priorities, others as speed & handling, yet others may focus only in one area that gives a much higher bonus to just one category). If one track is giving you a hard time with turns that's costing you precious health due to many sharp winding turns, don't stop yourself from temporarily switching to a better handling/ shield combo. There's a small learning curve: it's easy to pickup and play, and if you choose to just enjoy the game, you will. Vehicles are less 'weighty,' constantly bobbing (both due to the anti-grav nature of the game,) and tracks quickly progress from easing you in to the game to challenging your reflexes. If you choose to play Wipeout as fun, no worries- easy mode, and normal, later, remains more of a fun challenge. Yet the game allows for true mastery; watching those who devote efforts into it can produce dizzying runs of speed that's more akin to a well-choreographed speed ballet. Just like the originals, split-screen is supported, as well as online racing. No skimping in that area, including a 'race box' that allows you to host multiplayer online events with varying tracks and presets. Wipeout is, without a doubt, one of the best racing series that ever hit Sony, if not in all of gaming. The slow dismissal of the series (Wipeout HD & Fury were never released physically, and hit early in PS3s lifespan,) was met with dismay by longtime fans; not due to nostalgia's sake where replaying it reminded you why it became outdated, but because it was easy to pickup, a challenge, fun even when runs went wrong, and breathtaking to behold when you had a perfect run. Two final things: They've included a fun photo mode that's becoming more and more standard now, but is still much appreciated, and lastly, if you're looking for a couch co-op game that's not something that requires tons of planning/ getting 'stuck' playing longer than you intended, Wipeout is PERFECT. It's an incredible game to sit down with friends, some pizza, and some drinks while being able to end the game once your session begins to die down. 3 games, low price, high value, and not a cash-in on memories. Whether single player or multiplayer, Wipeout Omega Collection is yet ANOTHER win in the Sony exclusives.",5,3,1,755,3284,68,1076,29,13,59.84,11.38,8.64,14.02
"Wipeout has a long history on Playstation and its finally arrived on the Playstation 4. Fans of the series wouldve preferred a new entry in the series, but this package should not be looked over.

It is not a particularly long game, but, again, it is fine for the younger set, say grades 1-4.

There are 4 different mechs and within that there is like 6-7 special abilities like getting health after a kill is an example of one. There are also 'Trials' where you get to run through rings in a level, shoot targets, fight enemies, etc. in sort of a chain and they progressively get harder. I thought this was pretty neat. There is also a lot of customization for your pilot that you can unlock and sponsor challenges that you can do in your offline or online matches since they are separate. I can only imagine how great this game would be with multiplayer being filled with other players. However, if you go into it expecting to play against bots with some challenges and a lot of unlockables I think you will not regret this purchase.

There is an authentic sports game to be experienced here. That's why I rated the game good (I really wanted to love it). My biological experience with it is another thing entirely. The game tells you to play in short sessions, to allow your body to 'adapt' to the virtual experience. After all, the body 'thinks' it's there. Not a hard thing to stay true to for me... My stomach would knot up and literally hurt after 20 minutes of gameplay, effectively ending my gameplay for the evening. After several sessions, I was able to go 30 to 45 minutes before I became too nauseated to continue playing. If I had a die-hard love for sports, or this game, I would have toughed it out. I did see improvements from the short sessions over the 2 weeks I had this game.

At times it feels like an interactive movie as much as a game, with pre-rendered cutscenes and voice-acted conversations taking up a lot of the play time. But especially for a kid who's new to mystery games, I'd say this would be a great choice. It's not too demanding with frequent hints from Pikachu and an optional Easy Mode, and there's no punishment for getting any sections wrong. As an adult and longtime Pokemon fan, I was really impressed with the creative direction here. The city where the game takes place is full of people and Pokemon living side-by-side, and that gets used in some really creative ways. A lot more thought went into this than the typical, main-series approach of 'Everyone you meet wants to talk about battling and nothing else'. This felt like a sort of fun spin-off of the anime world I always wanted to visit as a kid. Give it a try.",5,1,0,179,734,22,258,9,8,64.71,9.17,6.82,12.87
"I went into buying this game with no real expectations. It seemed like an interesting addition to the Pokmon gaming franchise and it is now one of the best games I've played on my 3DS. This is a fairly simple game but extremely entertaining and fulfilling for die-hard fans of Pokmon and would also be a perfect launchpad for brand new fans of the series. The graphics are beautiful on the New Nintendo 2DS XL (this game ONLY plays in 2D anyways so it's not necessary to have a 3DS). While the game is extremely easy to advance through, it will provide a good 10-14 hours of game time start-to-finish and has fairly high replay potential due to the Pikachu amiibo adding additional content. If you are looking for a challenging game with a lot of action, this isn't the Pokmon game for you but if you are a long-time fan of the series in genera or a brand new fan altogether this is a really great addition to the 3DS gaming library.",5,1,0,181,743,21,257,6,13,56.09,12.93,7.36,16.71
"Scooby-Doo meets Pokemon. That's Detective Pikachu. With simple cases that don't involve just a lot of guesswork by the older crowd, but is still thoroughly enjoyable by everyone, I can't think of a better description. The game is voiced quite well with some fun dialogue. No matter your take on the gruff-voiced Pikachu, the voice work on display here is solid. Nothing to knock you out of the park, but lots of wit and humor given a life. I don't want to make this a long review, so I'll actually end it off here by saying that Detective Pikachu deserves a 5-Star rating because it's, simply put, enjoyable.

All it really does is just unlock some movie clips in the game. Not such a big deal at the end of the day. Even then, the base is so large, it doesn't even fit on the screen of a new 3DS!

"For years, I've been saying Nintendo should make a 'Best Of Mario Party' game, and this didn't disappoint. Granted, I expected it to be on a home console system, not the DS family, but this thing is quite a gem. There is not a single misstep in these minigames. Whereas each Mario Party has some minigames that you groan when you're forced to play them, each minigame here is fun to play. I was nervous about who was deciding what the 'Best 10' games were from each Mario Party, but Nintendo had astounding insight as to which games should be included. I even felt there was quite a bit of thought that went into the chronology of the way the games were presented. For instance, the Slot Car Derby game is positioned in as much of a critical spot in the single-player mode of this game as it was when it appeared in Mario Party 2. Another example is Bumper Balls, which is perhaps the quintessential example of a Mario Party mini-game, and is appropriately placed in the very last stretch of the single-player mode. Even Bowser's Big Blast is described as the 'most vicious' mini-game, which is spot-on for anybody who remembers the strike of fear whenever this game would be chosen. There are two downsides to this game, the first being that there isn't any real game board to play on. There IS one basic game board where you chase stars (a la the N64 and Gamecube versions), but it's very primitive and doesn't offer much strategy. The only other downside to this game is it can't be played with friends, unless they also own a DS. This is a bummer as I am the only 30+ year-old loser I know who owns one, and I think it's illegal to walk up to minors in the park and ask if they want to play a game with me. There's a very simple remedy to both of these problems: put this game on the Switch. In fact, you could re-release the same exact game with the addition of the 'best' game board from each of the 10 Mario Parties. This way, you can have the game board style of play that became so quickly beloved and was the design for Mario Party 1-8, and you can also integrate the linear gameboard that's available in Mario Party 9 and 10, which seems to be the new direction of the franchise. I do not own a Switch. I don't plan to because I own a Wii U and there is quite a bit of overlap between those two consoles. But if Mario Party Top 100 were brought to the Switch with some of the original game boards from the earlier Mario Party series, I would get one without hesitation. Cognizant of the fact that Nintendo is not going to take my feedback and do what I'm asking, I'll just say that this game is a real treat and I recommend it to anyone who has had fun with this series in the past. I can't even imagine how fun this would be with other people.",5,11,0,547,2155,48,742,21,11,65.64,10.58,6.23,13.93

"For those who have no idea what this game is it is best described as a Hack n' Slash/Beat em-up/Shoot em-up game that likes to at times take a break and focus on detective work similar to a game like Detroit where you gather clues and information before proceeding through a level. These detective instances can be as long as you are curious of your environment and are usually the starting point when going into a level and is followed by the combat that is the central focus of this game. If this sounds like your type of game then you are in for a treat as this game takes the style and makes it satisfying especially with it's own unique mechanic that grants you more options than just button mashing. For the most part how the game plays is extremely satisfying, especially once you begin mastering the added mechanics that make this game unique. You're given a Legion that you can control either as an auto-attack AI, fully control the movement of at the expense of controlling the camera, as an addition to your chain of attacks to deliver a strong blow, or (again once you get a hang of every utility the game offers for you) all of the above. This Legion is linked to you via a chain which you can wrap around enemies to bind them in place for a moment or use to springboard off of as you pull yourself towards your Legion along this chain. It takes a bit to familiarize yourself with controlling it, but once you do the possibilities expand and you find yourself playing a game you've never played before. Now that you got the gist of what you do in the game and how it makes for your experience, it's time to discuss the faults of the game that prevent it from being the perfect experience it could easily have been and making you aware of what you're probably not going to like. First of all as the Legion is a second weapon at your dispense, controlling 2 things at once can make a hectic fight feel even more hectic, especially when your Legion is just getting knocked around or isn't quite moving as precise as you want it to nor does it always land a blow when you use it in your string of attacks as mentioned earlier. The main reason behind the frustrating control of your Legion would be the fault of the camera and how it operates particularly during. Your camera's position is ultimately what determines how your Legion moves and given the game locks-onto enemies (who of course move and dash respectively during combat) all it takes is an enemy to move a few feet towards you and now your Legion isn't going in the direction you were pressing it to go and more importantly intending for it to go. This makes wrapping around enemies frustrating especially in hectic fights with more than 3 enemies engaged at a time; also given the chain doesn't necessarily seem to have a consistency to snap onto an enemy and stay on top of that makes attempting a seemingly crucial, centralized feature frustrating to use in a lot of instances. Continuing with the lock-on given you change targets with the same input as the camera (right analog) when you're trying to get a better view of what's around/behind you you'll accidentally be switching targets when you don't want to which will ultimately lead you into swinging or shooting as nothing as it sometimes does even when you're locked-onto the correct target. Ultimately there are going to be moments where you should be hitting something, but you aren't. As for avoiding enemy attacks and stopping enemies there's fault in that too as the game doesn't make for a nicely-tuned way of assuring your dodges are successful as most other games do. You'll be taught in the game that if you dodge an attack just before it hits, you can swing back with a fury of blows. However there'll be times where even if you perfect dodge following up with an attack will only result in you getting hit and knocked off your feet as the game will not isolate your battles amongst individual enemies so if you got 2 enemies on you and they both swing at you one slightly later than the other, dodging will only mean you moved into the other enemy's attack and trying to attack is as futile as trying to dodge both attacks at once. Your attacks barely have momentum to them too so if you deal with a faster enemy don't ever expect to land a full series of attacks as hardly anything will make them flinch and hold them back from them knocking you to the ground or flinch with 1 or multiple hit(s.) If these things get touched-up in future updates then I'd have no complaints about this game. The more technical you can be the more satisfying playing gets. They do give you a 'sparring' option in the Training Room in the HQ building and you can choose from various enemy types to practice on; use this to brush up on your skill and familiarity of the combat of the game. It's definitely a useful option that even someone like me who usually just picks up, plays, learns along the way, and avoids training modes in games even resorted to, invested in, and found great use in. As a wrap up the game despite the flaws mentioned (in detailed, horrendous length) is actually very comfortable and satisfying. From the genre it's definitely something I'd strongly recommend. While it's downfalls are frustrating it doesn't make completion feel impossible and it's unique use of the Legion makes for a feeling of a fresh new game that you've never played before. I've given a 4/5 stars as it's not perfect, but to put the frustration of the flaws in perspective in a 10-scale rating I can't put it higher than an 8/10 as 9/10 would be undermining the effect of those flaws.",4,1,3,1065,4485,106,1518,26,19,44.67,17.2,8.24,20.37

"After release weekend having played through quite a bit of the game I think the game has been great. The story line from this game has been better than the story line from the first game in my opinion. As always the details in this game is amazing. When you're walking around Washington DC and can see legit land marks it's a great immersion. Street names, store locations, etc all real! Add in the weapons! That's right, the weapons are real. You can find actual firearms in use around the world by military and law enforcement. Weapons react as you expect they would. Weapons and gear can be modded to give better tactical advantages as you progress. Release weekend there are still some bugs that were not detected during betas, or that just simply made it through. While annoying they're not entirely game breaking and the devs are already working on fixes. Cosmetics are where the real collector comes out in you. Everything from hats and sunglasses to little backpack ornaments. You can outfit your Agent in tons of different ways.",4,0,1,185,834,20,266,15,6,72.68,6.19,8.31,9.26
"Since the only review at the time of posting this was a preemptive post about being excited for something that couldn't actually be reviewed at the time and because the beta managed to not expose a lot of the issues, I figured it was only fair to write an honest review. I pre-ordered the gold edition and picked it up on the 13th, which allowed for the three days of early access. The exotic shotgun you get is only good for a few levels, so it's more or less just to make you feel strong for about 30 minutes. After that, it requires you get to level 30 before you can upgrade it. That is, if you even remember it when you reach that level. The game content is just as good, if not better than the first game. Unfortunately, you may find responding to calls for help a little tricky at first because you have to respond and then locate the person on the map to accept. This is not so bad, though. It allows you to meet a lot of new players. The biggest issue is that some of the skills do not function properly and the game has a lot of random critical errors. Critical errors are the ones where the game stops and a blue screen appears. On top of seeing them rather often on certain levels, they are also extremely slow to load. After you dismiss the error, you have to load the entire game in hopes that one person in your party did not crash and you can resume progress. You usually get lucky enough that one person in four survived, but not so lucky that it won't just crash again shortly after returning. As for the skills, you probably shouldn't waste your time on sharing the revive version of the hive. It will revive you and it has a 90% success rate to automatically drop when you would otherwise need to be revived and it is available. It will not work on other players, though, which happens to be the main functionality it advertises. Throwing it will leave them sitting in a large blue region as their revive time expires and they die. The beta made it appear fairly stable, so its hard to say if a developer decided to sabotage the game for release day or if they somehow introduced the issues last minute. Either way, they have had four days or constant patching and still no improvement.",3,0,3,421,1749,30,587,20,9,67.51,9.07,7.22,11.27

"With their sense of freedom and loving grasp of the Dark Knight's comic universe, 2009s Batman: Arkham Asylum and its 2011 sequel, Batman: Arkham City, are two of the best superhero games ever made. Batman: Return to Arkham brings both games - and all their DLC - to the current generation of consoles, but an unremarkable graphical upgrade doesnt do them justice. Thats not to say its not noticeable. Textures in Return to Arkham are much sharper: Batmans suit, for example, looks much more detailed. His cape in particular stands out beautifully, pebbled, catching the light. The bigger issue is performance. For a remastered version of older games, its disappointing that neither Asylum nor City runs at 60 frames per second - theyre both targeting 30. In fact, Asylum suffers from some odd stutters when Batman runs through a corridor or turns a corner. The issues arent bad enough to interrupt combat flow, but occasional chugging is a noticeable distraction. Outside of the two campaigns, all the DLC challenge maps and additional skins are here, so you can play as 1970s Batman - or even better, animated Batman - from the get-go. But theres nothing to differentiate the extra content from what was included in the Game of the Year editions, and the lack of making-ofs or behind-the-scenes details is a missed opportunity. If youve never played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and own a current-gen console, Return to Arkham is a fine place to start. But for those who already own both on PC or last gen, theres no real reason to pick this up beyond a rather uninspiring and technically disappointing graphical upgrade.",4,11,1,276,1305,36,437,13,12,51.34,11.37,10.61,13.71
"A collection of two of the best adventure brawlers ever created. You play as a psychotic vigilante named Batman in order to take down his most notorious enemy: Common Sense. Batman never seems to fully grasp the idea of sending The Joker to a court of law in order for him to be sent to a Max Pen where he'll spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement unable to hurt anyone else. Nope, instead he will be sent back to the Asylum he constantly breaks out off. Only this time The Joker wants to break into it so he can break out again and finally get Batman. Riveting stuff. Great remastered game with strong visuals, tight controls, and a shade of a collectathon game with the Riddler's riddles. Oh, and Batman likes to talk to himself...out loud...a lot...yeah.

"Both games in this collection play as well as they did when they came out, and run much smoother with stable frame rates and greatly improved loading times. Overhaul of the graphics makes environments look brilliant, and while character models are touched up some they still show their age.

"Arkham Asylum is still amazing! The textures and lighting have been overhauled making for a far more aesthetically pleasing game. The framerate is a solid 30 fps throughout. Arkham City also looks amazing! I only noticed a few framerate slow downs while playing. One thing I did notice though is that it seems to play and look better on regular PS4 and not Pro. Also the FMVs look very pixelated and weird on the Pro, but look fine on reg PS4. I'm sure this has to do with native 1080p output of the game and the Pro's nature to upscale to 2160p (4K).

"I am a huge fan of Batman, especially the Arkham series of games. I have played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City previously on the Xbox 360 and PS3, respectively. I gave my old systems and games to my nephew when I moved, so this was the perfect opportunity to upgrade to the next-gen versions. These games are still very fun, even though I played them both to death on the last generation systems. The gameplay is still smooth, the stories are great, and the voice acting is top notch. The graphical upgrade is nice, although still not quite up to the level of polish seen in Batman Arkham Knight. The inclusion of all previously-released DLC is also nice, but the omission of the Batman Arkham Origins game is a little disappointing. That game was not as well regarded, and made by a different developer, but I still enjoyed it on PS3 and would have liked to see it included in this collection. This is a must-buy for fans of Batman and/or action games who never played Asylum and City. There really isn't anything new here for people who still own the games on last gen systems, but if you don't have access to the old games anymore and/or want a graphical upgrade, go for it.",5,1,0,222,933,23,312,10,10,65.4,9.65,7.58,13.02

"I love these games but this remaster is a waste of time and money. The graphics may look better, but, to that end, they sacrificed the tone and ambiance of the game.

"SDBHWM (lol) is a crazy game. You can have Goku team up with Vegeta from GT, Super Saiyan 3 Radditz, Super Saiyan 4 Bardock, Adult Gotenks, and a Saibaman. If that sentence made sense to you, that tells you what sort of fan service you're in for. This game is an arcade game from Japan. And where Japan players had to buy actual packs of cards to play, everything is in this package which is like over 1100 cards. You play by making decks of 7 cards and in some cases even equipping them with new abilities. You can even make your own cards. From there you battle and depending on who you use and how you place them on a field they battle and use super moves with their 3D models. The graphics aren't like Dragon Ball FighterZ so you aren't going to be wow'd or anything, and the sound quality for the voices are... well they are from the arcade game and they suck (Japanese arcades are loud and they can't hear them!). But there's a ton of content there for your buck. There's a amusing and cheesy story mode, as well as an arcade mode that has you play through battles based on all arcs of the Dragon Ball Super show Including the new Broly movie, and some original stoy lines as well like Cell and Kid Buu being revived with the dark dragon balls. There's also online play including ranked battles and limited time events. There's no card trading though. You get cards by unlocking tickets as you play. It's pretty generous with them and cards are one time gains. So any duplicates are transformed to a currency you can use for more tickets. Yes you do spend tickets with a Gatcha system, but there's no micro transactions and the rate of getting cards feels good. I love the game and since it's on the switch you can play it anywhere you find time for a quick match and some packs. So I definitely recommend it to any Switch owners who love Dragon Ball and wanted to see some cool things that the show never dared look into!

And there's online battle and let me tell you, my first online match i fought a dude and died in one turn and all i could do was laugh because i felt like i was rolling through the story mode and then i get shown i have a lot to learn. so yeah, good video game, would recommend to dragon ball fans or card games fans.",5,1,0,196,732,11,243,5,16,62.16,14.33,5.4,17.92
"This game is a super popular title in the east. Over here in the west Dragon Ball fans have been blessed with receiving a release for the Nintendo Switch! Before I get into this review I do want to state I am a bit bias. I love the DBZ franchise, and I am a sucker for semi grindy-heavy grind rpg's/collect-a-thons. Now if I haven't scared you away yet let me tell you what this cartridge has to offer. PROS: Hours upon hours of gameplay. A fun team building system, and rewarding gameplay. Several levels, and game modes. Nothing gets old if you like the gameplay loop. Many of your favorite faces making a return in varying combat styles, and skins. A Custom/Creation mode. Fully Voiced. CONS: Outdated Graphics (I for one do not believe it hinders the experience at all) Corny dialogue from time to time. The CI Battle system can feel a bit cheap at times in pivotal moments, and can leave you feeling like your battling a rigged game. Some unnecessary QTE's. Long story short if you are a hardcore DB fan, or just really like micromanaging your teams, and collecting stuff this game will be plenty of fun for more than one run. I do recommend getting the gamer's unlocked through best buy to buy this game for 48 vs the full tag price.",4,2,1,236,976,21,333,17,5,73.37,6.47,6.39,9.11

There's even a campaign mode which has you completing sets of objectives on a table before moving you along to a new one, eventually spanning all 19 tables. Any pinball game can throw a few tables together and let chase high scores on your own. Very few go out of their way to keep giving you new ways to play and new goals to achieve. Being a Star Wars fans definitely helps, but pinball fans will probably love this regardless.",5,1,0,116,499,9,166,7,8,68.95,7.76,7.71,9.73
"The Switch version of the game has great features, like the all new career mode. The game also features tate mode. I've played a lot of the tables in the career mode plays perfect on the Switch.

This port of Banana Blitz removes the motion controls but still handles very awkwardly. In an odd move this HD remake only has 10 of the original 50 mini-games. Might be worth buying on sale, but not full price. Hold out for Monkey Ball 1+2 HD that everyone actually wants.",3,1,0,83,343,9,119,6,5,71.5,6.72,6.36,9.87

"This isn't the first copy of NieR: Automata I've purchased, but I believe in the game's value so much I decided to gift my first copy to a friend and then buy it again. The fact that this is perhaps the only game I've ever felt comfortable buying twice is testament to its success as a video game. While it has the signature Platinum combat style (albeit one of their weaker combat models), it's outside of combat where the game absolutely shines. This game's storytelling chops are some of the best in the industry, the soundtrack is exceptional, and the characters are multifaceted without being convoluted. I do have to point out, however, that the game's side quests are largely very fetch-questy, but aren't necessarily that important beyond understanding the world's inhabitants a bit better. I would suggest researching which side quests to do in order to maximize the world-building while minimizing rote fetching. Also, when people say you have to play the game multiple times to truly experience it, they're only half right. The second playthrough repeats the first route's story through the eyes of a second character, with some major gameplay and story differences as such. The third playthrough is more like unlocking the second chapter of the story, where it takes place after the events of the first two. If you've played an Adventure-era Sonic title with their multiple stories, think of it like them. Would I recommend this version over a normal copy of NieR: Automata? Probably not. Unless it's on sale, you can stick with the normal version as the DLC is a few arenas with some mediocre rewards. Unless you thoroughly enjoy the game's combat (again, not some of Platinum's best), I'd recommend just going for the base package.",5,2,0,314,1397,40,482,14,11,54.21,11.27,9.04,14.07

Every time you play a scenario you are kicked off the server or the game stops for no reason. Game does not save progress, the game looks nothing like the teaser we seen in 2017 to get everyone hyped for this release. I took a chance because of biowares name. Never again! I'll wait until it goes to the bargain bin. This is as bad as it gets. This game should not have been released and I feel like I was robbed out of my dollars.

The nice thing is everything they have can be bought with in game currency and it's mostly cosmetic. Also another plus is they claim to give any dlc in the future for free. People complain about repetitive missions in this game, honestly it's not that bad. If you really think about, Destiny was and still is the same too. You choose a mission and go to the zone and shot up the bad guys and collect things. A lot of other games that people enjoy are repetitive.

"First impressions aren't bad. While there are a few issues that bug me about the game, the 'let's all hate on it because EA published it' bandwagon hatemongering isn't entirely founded. gameplay, graphics and voice acting are quite good. Mission structure, loot drops and and load times need patching and updating. The core of the experience is rock solid but some tweaks are necessary to truly make it shine. If you're in the edge about the game, keep an eye out for news on updates and the free dlc Bioware promised to see if it's something you'll enjoy. 3/5 - good but not great. People aren't able to formulate their own opinion so they just regurgitate whatever the big hatemongers on YouTube spew. The game isn't even close to FAILURE OF THE MILLENNIA those people would have you believe, but it's probably not going to set the world on fire either in its current state.",3,3,2,164,695,18,235,9,8,67.11,8.43,7.49,11.68

"I'm pretty sure everyone has anxiously been awaiting Anthem for a couple of years now, I know I was. Now that I have it in my hands I sort of wish EA would have cooked this one longer maybe even another year. While it looks good, Anthem is a fairly shallow game at its core. Sometimes shallow is good see my Crackdown 3 review as example but in this case, what remains isn't interesting enough to keep my attention for very long. I bought 4 games on the same day, I suspect Anthem will either be the one I play last, or yet another title that gets unceremoniously dropped in the backlog pile with Fallout 76. No, it's not as bad as Fallout 76, but it's close to as disappointing, given the expectations I have of BioWare.",3,0,1,141,567,12,195,6,10,65.98,9.89,6.59,12.8

"Anthem has all of the potential in the world. Unfortunately, upon finishing the main story line (as of release - this game is meant to be ever-evolving with content updates), you find that the game seems to have been rushed to release without ironing out all of the details. As previously stated, Anthem is meant to be an evolving game as the developer/publisher plan to release new content over time to increase the depth of the game post-purchase. This is a great idea for a console game, in my opinion, mirroring other MMORPGs that are successful, ie: World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, etc. However, the game was also released with many, many bugs, some game-breaking. The formulas for character health and loot distribution are obviously flawed and have been addressed multiple times with patches, but are still not where they should be. Oftentimes, you find yourself having trouble with content that you just breezed through at the same difficulty. This is because a glaring issue with player statistics being loaded incorrectly for missions has persevered despite multiple attempts to rectify it. Also, there are many times where the game will outright crash causing you to lose your progress, and frustratingly, your hard-earned loot. The main draw, or plus, is the implementation of flying into travel and, most awesomely, combat. Setting it apart from its cohort, Destiny, the ability to fly in all areas of the game (even underwater!) really adds something new to the looter shooter genre. I hope the publisher/developer are able to fix many of the huge issues that accompanied the game upon release soon as this game has huge fun potential if this can occur before the game's playerbase jumps ship.",3,0,2,291,1381,40,459,13,13,50.67,11.75,10.78,14.45
"I've seen mixed reviews of this from game journalists, but as a fan of previous Bioware games like the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, I'm having a lot of fun with this new IP from the studio. I'm traditionally a solo player and love RPGs, so I usually shy away from online multiplayer games, but Anthem has enough of the traditional Bioware flavor, while still being its own game, to keep me happy combined with fun gameplay and combat that have convinced me to fly my javelin out of my comfort zone and multiplayer missions. I really enjoy the game mechanics, especially the flying, and I've enjoyed exploring the world and talking to NPCs. I doubt any game will ever rise to the world and character-building heights of Mass Effect or Mass Effect 2, but Anthem is fun and I don't regret my purchase at all.",4,0,2,153,646,17,223,4,18,44.71,16.53,8.25,19.74
"Anthem is a game that is very visually appealing. It is also entertaining having the ability to fly and fight like iron man... to a point. I looked forward to this game, however in my honest opinion it fell quite a bit short. More content is promised in the future, however the current content available is lacking. Anthem provides a short campaign with very little character development. The weapon progression is lackluster and the customizable gear is no where near that of other online games of its sort. Servers drop frequently even with the updates, the sound cuts out at times, and the game simply does not meet expectations. It is painful to express that Anthem is a 6.5/10 at best. It has its moments and will hopefully improve in the near future. I currently cannot recommend the game to a friend, however in the near future hopefully it can improve with updates.",3,0,2,155,701,22,241,12,7,62.19,7.79,8.5,10.84
"Overall, Anthem is an awesome game that looks and plays very well, in my opinion. Ive read plenty of good and bad reviews on this game but wanted to see for myself. At this time, a week after launch, the game still needs some work to iron out some bugs and server connectivity issues. Honestly, Ive only had connection issues during peak play times so its understandable (to an extent). These issues will not affect the game forever and both BioWare and EA are reputable companies that make quality game experiences. Im looking forward the end game and new content. If youre on the fence about this game, I recommend getting it.

"i heard so many bad things about this game but the truth i wanted the steel case that came free so again great deal and something i wanted in my collection. one problem some of these game makers are being forced to rush a game and the main person in charge is very wrong because they no the game is not ready but they still put it out. they would double there money if they tested them out and waited until it is really ready. i bought it to see where they went wrong. the truth is they use to take at least three years to make a great game now they they do not care just put the game out who cares if it works or not. star wars devil may cry and call of duty make sure they play. anyway i can't say much about this game except maybe they will remake it like it was supose to me. as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007.",5,0,1,171,650,6,209,8,8,81.74,7.17,5.17,9.95
"A lot of the bugs and glitches present at release have been addressed. The game is fun for all of the reasons other reviewers have mentioned. The potential for greatness is still there. The biggest current hurdles for the game and its developers are fixing the loot system and impressing with the Cataclysm event. Depending on how that pans out, it could be the game's saving grace or the final nail in the coffin. I'm still holding onto hope. While the game at release was lacking the polish and depth we were promised and expecting, Anthem has great bones. There's still the possibility that they could turn it around. I would certainly say, 'Give it a chance,' at its current $20 price point.",4,0,1,126,554,9,177,9,7,73.78,6.45,7.94,8.46
"Fun game, pure and simple. I enjoy the game and play it almost daily. Being able to fly is really cool. The combat mechanics are fun and work well with the 3rd person view. I like that each Javalin is completely different and has it's own unique abilities. Speaking of which, the abilities are lots of fun. It's just a joy dropping a massive lightening strike or cluster of missiles on an enemy. Anthem got a bad reputation at launch which I don't think was fair. Sure it a had a few bugs but a lot of games do at launch so this was nothing new and the issues weren't really that bad. The developers have been constantly fixing things so it keeps getting better. All I can say, is don't believe all the negative press about this game, try it for yourself.",5,0,1,148,593,15,205,11,5,76,6,5.56,9.44

This is a game for the extremely novice who has never played any kind of video game. I paid $20 and regret it.",1,7,1,89,335,4,115,5,6,79.45,6.6,4.67,8.92

This is a must try for any 2k fan that's tired of them taking extra money just to make shots,unlocks players and buy clothes. With live 19, all you need to do is buy the game and have the time to grind and get your stats up, that's it that's all.

It's beautifully balanced not only in terms of game play, but also in terms of being fun for kids and adults-- and you will find a lot of both. This really is a 'fun for all ages' game. Part role-playing and part CCG, Wiz101 is a nice mix of light-hearted atmosphere and challenging gameplay. Don't let the early levels fool you. This game can get pretty challenging as you progress.

Since all best buy stores had the gamecards there was no problem in getting it, except through the on line store. I recommend that if this is a normal problem, all gift cards that a person wants should not be purchased over BestBuy.com.

The scariest part is when you are walking around when everything goes green. Other than that, very boring game, just walking around. The decisions arent very game changing either. Saves a character or whatever. This game is best watched being played. Ive watched a few different play through a for this game and I had more fun than playing it.

You can use your own voice to interact with the in game NCP. its fun tense and scary at some points. Its a mystery story. I loved it. VR are is evolving into a great new game mechanic.

However, the way Microsoft is treating this game... almost makes fans like myself feel that they hope it will FAIL and not OUTSELL their highly advertised 'Sea of Thieves'. Dropping the price point of a game BEFORE it's released raised a few flags and the overall lack of advertisements is disheartening. Unlike 'Sea of Thieves' which has had a plethora of ads including an awesome one with Sean Astin... yep that guy from Lord of the Rings, Stranger Things, Rudy, The Goonies...

I held out getting Detroit: Become Human since it felt like the triple-A releases would knock the price down, and low and behold this bundle was announced for a great deal. Detroit: Become Human is a modern masterpiece. The game takes the Quantic Dream formula and amps it up to 11. The choices are what makes these games great, and you get to see how your actions stacked up against your friends and the rest of the world. The story is a little... cliche, but still very cool. The development of characters is better than Hollywood movies. The game suffers from clunky controls, as their other games do, but it doesn't take away from the overall game itself. The graphics are stunning, gorgeous character models, backgrounds and effects help draw you into the story. Worth playing for anyone looking for more story than game.

"Wolfenstein II is just one example of how Panic Button makes the seemingly impossible happen on the Nintendo Switch. They did it with Rocket League, the did it with DOOM, and they did it with Wolfenstein. Wolfenstein II is good looking for what it is and runs relatively smoothly on the Switch with significant visual compromises and a 30 FPS target as opposed to 60 FPS on other platforms. The game itself took me about 10 hours to finish on Do or Die (equivalent to Hard I think) difficulty. It was a fun gameplay experience in handheld mode that doesn't hold up as well on TV mode. Since beating the game, I have not replayed it as I have no motivation to. It's a one and done game for me as I don't really care to find all of the collectibles and do a 100% run as that's not my desire with Wolfenstein II. In brief summary: Wolfenstein II on the Nintendo Switch is one of the best FPS games on the system, but it is not worth the $60 price tag in my opinion.",4,2,0,189,757,23,262,8,10,65.58,9.98,6.5,14.32
"Panic Button and Bethesda outdid themselves; This game far exceeded my expectations. I have played it on both the PS4 and Nintendo Switch. While the resolution isn't as nice as the PS4 version, the portability of the Switch game makes it an easy purchase. I never felt like the responses were too slow and the framerate was nice and steady throughout. If you're unfamiliar with the series, playing the other games is not a necessity but definitely adds to the depth of the story. Think DOOM marries Last of Us and they have a baby. This game is a must have for the adult Switch gamer. This is rated M for multiple reasons, please don't let your kids play this game.",5,2,0,124,530,12,177,8,7,70.34,7.3,7.42,10.07
"This game is amazing. I cant believe its on the switch. I have it for PS4 already but I had to pick it up for the switch day one. Killing NZs on the go has never been more fun! I am in the beginning of the game but it plays really well with no hiccups. The aiming in hand held is way better then I ever could of wished for. Its almost same as using a controller (handheld mode), just slight difference. A few parts are a little dark but for the most part the graphics are amazing considering this is a triple A game that was recently released running on the switch. So happy they made this for the switch. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good shooter with a great story.",5,2,0,136,535,11,178,10,4,82.3,5.16,5.15,8.68

I mostly play in handheld mode and the gyro aiming is awesome, I'm about halfway through the game and besides some blurry textures here and there and the fact that it can be kind of difficult to see enemies from a distance sometimes I have no other complaints. Panic button does great work porting these big AAA games to switch so I am happy to support the games they work on no doubt.",4,1,0,119,455,4,149,3,17,60.65,14.65,5.94,17.21
"Wolfenstein 2 is an amazing single player first person shooter. There were multiple cut scenes where was just thinking where could things possibly go from here in the best kind of way. The shooting feels great, especially with motion controls. The game looks truly impressive when playing docked, considering how tiny the switch console is. In handheld, the game can be a bit blurry and too small to see, so I've played primarily in docked. If you can't play it elsewhere, Wolfenstein is a must buy if you like shooters.",5,1,0,92,418,9,131,6,8,70.81,7.19,8.99,10.05

"I say its adventure more then stealth cause it really is more like problem solving them being stealthy. The themes and challenge of the game is real though.

"With games like Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5, Mortal Kombat 11, and Rage 2 starting off the year, and games like Death Stranding and Cyberpunk 2077 (hoping!) wrapping up the holiday season, it would be all too easy to let a virtually unknown title like A Plague Tale slip under your nose unnoticed. That would be a huge tragedy. Not only is this one of the most graphically impressive and beautiful games (the lighting is unmatched) I've ever played, but the characters, story and gameplay pull you right into the world and really never let go. I actually CARED about the people in this game and found it difficult to put down the controller. This is 'survival horror' at its best and so many developers and publishers should be taking notes. Watching hordes of evil plague rats devour living victims in no time, or having Crusading henchmen chasing after you are actually nothing compared to the other frights awaiting you. And let's talk about that soundtrack... Easily one of the best in gaming. I really wish there was a Collector's Edition of this game!",5,1,0,189,848,26,287,10,10,59.18,9.7,9.02,13.06
"This game was very compelling, mainly due to the story told of, and interaction between, Amicia and Hugo. The game works best when being more stealthy, but overall a very good game! PS - the music is outstanding",4,1,0,37,167,5,58,3,6,61.7,7.72,8.34,10.34
"Like many of my favorite games, such as The Last of Us, The Witcher 3, to even Demons Souls on the PS3, some of the stealth, puzzle, and combat mechanics (which are minimal) are average to lacking at times, but made-up for ten-fold by the setting, graphics, atmosphere, acting, and storytelling. The game feels like a cross of several games but quite original in its story. Take aspects of The Last of Us mixed with Life is Strange or Tell Tale adventure with Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons to Dishonored. However, I would not call this an action game. It has a slower pace. The other aspect that impressed me on this is that it is very linear and not open world like many games, but the game designers make the world feel large. When you go down a path, you can run off a ways but always get to the same point and you can see many places in distance like an objective in one case. The characters had to get to a location in a city and I felt like I would have to go through many blocks and city warrens to get there and then I did just that and it felt like it should. This is also one of the few games in a while that user reviews on Metacritic are higher than critic reviews because critics seem to rate mostly after they rush a play through and rarely review games on any degree of artistic merit. In this generation of remasters and the same old same old with updated graphics, this game is refreshing.",5,1,0,272,1106,22,367,10,12,65.08,10.94,7.02,14.12
"Easily one of the best-looking games on console with an excellent tone-setting soundtrack. This game has drawn comparisons to Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, The Last of Us, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and more, but it truly is its own game based around exploration, puzzle-elements, stealth, and (very) light combat. Honestly, it is closest to Hellblade if you have to pick one, only I think the combat is handled far better here. While based in a historical time period, the story takes great liberties and introduces some dark twists into its story, which is actually quite enjoyable despite some occasional jank in the voice acting and animation quality. While I wish some narrative points had been done with better pacing, and perhaps just a bit more setup/emotional build-up, I am overall very happy with the experience and have high hopes for a potential sequel set in this genuinely interesting world. You'll be hard-pressed to find another aesthetic as interesting as this world's time period (Bloodborne's comes to mind). The gameplay does have some AI issues early on, but after a couple of flubs, you'll find out how to easily avoid triggering them. This game is best targeted to those interested in narrative-driven, beautifully presented games, that have room for collectibles and exploration (but remain a linear experience). Temper your AAA expectations, and you will find this to be a true indie gem that could honestly blow-up to something the scale of the Witcher sequels if the developers wisely reinvest some of their profits into expanding the story and gameplay.",4,1,0,272,1279,47,431,9,16,42.11,14.89,10.87,19
"The game is based in France during the 1300s during the time of the bubonic plague. The story follows a young girl named Amicia who is thrust into dealing with the Inquisition and the incredibly designed rat infestation plaguing everything in their path as she tries to keep her younger brother safe. It is an incredible linear game with a fantastic story in a beautifully rendered world in the Unreal 4 Engine. It is definitely worth playing, it is one of my favorite games this year (2019) so far and clocked in at about 10-12 hours for a full play through for me.",5,1,0,104,456,13,153,4,13,55.99,11.91,8.84,15.4
"I'm not going to lie, after Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice, I went into this with high hopes believing it would be just as emotionally driven, visually complex, and thought provoking. BUT, after completing this game, I can honestly say it didn't click until closer to the end. The ending definitely featured an out of place boss fight and a woeful conclusion to a pretty bland game. Not sure if I went in with too high expectations, but this game did not land. The gameplay consists of running from rats, using a sling to 'rock' people, 'rocking' bells to distract people, using flames to do flame things, and just sneaking. It's not as boring as I'm making it out to be, but it isn't very entertaining either. There are some nice emotional beats throughout the story, voice acting is believable, the graphics are pretty, responsive controls, and a good length.",3,0,1,154,678,17,227,7,11,59.8,10.38,8.74,13.22

"Obsidian Entertainment essentially made Fallout without the Fallout license. It has the same tone as Bethesda's Fallout games despite the setting being wildly different, the gameplay feels similar yet more refined, and there is an added layer of polish that has been absent from this style of game for awhile. Buy this game if: -You enjoy Role Playing Games. -You are a fan of Fallout 3, 4, New Vegas, or even Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines. -You want to see a game developed by masters of the genre. -You like quests with meaningful choices, dialogue with impact, and an atmosphere that is unmatched by modern games in the genre. -You want to support a developer who clearly deserves it. -You dislike abuse of power specifically on a corporate level. Do NOT buy this game if: -RPG's just aren't your thing. -You have astrophobia. -You think Fallout 76 is a genuinely good game. -You love capitalism and corporate abuses of power.* -You dislike dialogue in video games. This is an informal review, thus I wouldn't give the game a score, but this is legitimately everything I, and many others, wanted Fallout 4 to be. I say this as someone who has enjoyed Fallout 4 for ~1000 hours. Seriously, The Outer Worlds is a master class in game design and Obsidian deserves all praise they get. It isn't perfect, there are a few things that the game could use (grenades, third person mode, more Parvati, etc.) but the pros greatly outweigh the cons and I highly recommend it. *Actually, if you like corporate abuses of power then this game might even be for you. It's an RPG to the core and supports you making choices, thus you can be a corporate shill.",5,16,4,295,1298,39,447,20,7,63.67,8.04,8.07,11.19

It feels equal parts Fallout and The Expanse, with a much less dire long game. This is an outrageously fun and funny game. The characters are each deep and interesting, the quests are varied and unique, and the gameplay is constantly fun. I highly recommend.",5,1,0,118,483,11,164,9,5,75.95,5.92,6.01,8.97
"This game started out well. If you liked the good Fallouts, this plays like that franchise. The game kind of falls off slowly around the middle of the game. I had fun playing this overall though think it is a the bottom of the 2019 games I've played. The skill tree (there are actually two) was weak. In other games, by the end of the game your character has filled out most or at least grown strong in a skillset that works for you. In this game, you don't fill up the entire sill tree which means you can end up spending your points on skills that don't really help. You do want to spend skill points on your style of preference, but a better strategy is to spend points on the way that unlocks specific things in the game. That's why I agree with a previous suggestion to wait until you need a skill before you use the points. The story is weak and discovered through a slow dialog / subtitle process. Talking to the other characters seems to take ten times longer than it should. It reminds me of reading through a Choose Your Own Adventure book from the past. People who buy shooter games probably do not want to spend huge chunks of time reading through conversations and logs. There are multiple endings depending on your decisions, but none of them, good, bad or otherwise seemed at all interesting. It appears that to have fun in combat, you need to play at a high difficult setting. If you play on normal, don't use the max of two companions or the teammates will take out most of the bad guys. I have other minor gripes on this game but I would recommend playing this game once if you don't have any other new games.",3,1,0,311,1287,25,403,17,8,78.64,6.84,6.91,10.53

"Aside from being the Fallout-killer gamers have needed, the game also blends in flavors of Mass Effect and Bioshock - the outcome being a product that is incredibly immersive, but also somewhat shallow in some areas. My first and major gripe is an easy swipe at low hanging fruit: the load times, sweet Zeus are they long. At first I was glad they had some great art to stare at during the load screens, but by the end I wanted to never see them again. Minor gripe aside, what really cuts into the greatness at hand is basically one that can be blamed on something like budget, and that is the game becomes rather redundant certain areas: guns, even though they can be upgraded on multiple way, they do start to become junk-fodder for the inventory menu. And speaking of inventory, I had a TON of it on a normal mode play through - I only used most of the consumable out of curiosity after not having touched them for almost the entire game. The same goes for ammo, armor and weapon upgrades - I hope Supernova mode remedies the general feeling of being overpowered. And lastly, as big as the game feels, and as much player decision is involved, at some point the veil starts to thin and show where the pathways converge. It is worth mentioning that the skill points can definitely change a persons game style and experience. Just dont expect to be pulling of any no-killing stealth runs, as no matter what youll either be shooting or slicing down enemies to progress. Now onto some of the positives. From the get-go, no matter what console, the game looks beautiful. Graphics in detail, such as characters, can be somewhat tamed down from the usual AAA push, but it doesnt detract attention in any way. Movement is fluid and feels much better than the jank that came with Fallout games - dont get it wrong, there is still some jank, but not the annoying sort. Dialogue options are fun to play with, and are well worth exploring with almost all characters, most definitely the companions. Some companion stories give a bit more strings to latch onto, but all are still great. Exploring the multiple planets offers a variety of settings, each of them with their own personality and atmosphere. Overall, everything carries a great symbiosis between all of its gameplay/story systems. Side missions can be fetch-questish at times, but ultimately most are immersive and fun to take on. As a whole, the game has very little flaws, and where they do exist its mostly a matter of the game being a new IP with limitations - fortunately the creators are legendary enough to know where/how to apply the proper amount of experience into the size of game they had in mind. With Obsidian being acquired by MS, I can definitely see this becoming a franchise with bigger and more fruitful ideas, and the small flaws practically erased. The story was in vein with these sort of games, and while this one couldve had a little more of everything, it succeeds in doing what it set out to do, if not better. I absolutely enjoyed this one, and think its fit for all sorts of players to take on, but its also clear that fans of Fallout (especially New Vegas) will dig what The Outer Worlds has to offer. I truly hope to see another entry thats able to expand upon the ideas that are presented in this original.",4,1,0,592,2624,61,871,23,13,56.24,11.81,9.11,14.42
"The Outer Worlds is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It's a FPS RPG with a large amount of loot and customization options. The quests play out much like those in the Fallout series. The gun play however, is quite a bit tighter. It's not as good as other dedicated FPS but that's only a small portion of the game. The only downfall for me is the smaller sectioned off maps. Instead of one enormous sprawling wasteland to explore there are multiple smaller planets. Most of which are sectioned off with cliffs which make the game feel a little claustrophobic at times.

"Yes this game borrows heavily from the Fallout series and it's set in space. Quite frankly, Obsidian should really be allowed to take over the Fallout series considering how well this game and FO: New Vegas is written. Bethesda is really ruining the FO franchise in my opinion with that travesty of FO76. But I digress. So far 10 hrs in, I am really digging The Outer Worlds which is this first person rpg/shooter/choose your own adventure game. For one, the character creator is the best I've seen in a while. The story lines and story paths are based on your choices in dialog and actions which I love; Obsidian really knows what they are doing when it comes to writing and branching story lines and not just giving everyone a safe ending regardless of choices made. The comedy in the writing is also great and not annoying or childish like BL3. I love this version of VATs supremely better vs. the FO series. I just wish you could map VATs here to L1 instead of R1. Lastly, the orchestral soundtrack is ridiculously good and I find myself humming the melodies for days after! If you love the FO series and good RPG's, show this industry that you want more games that are like this vs. Bethesda turning their franchises into random loot, action games without souls because they are greedy: yuck!",5,1,0,237,1038,26,343,14,8,67.21,8.09,8.2,11.16
"This review is not a knock on the game one bit, its actually a really great game so for that I'll give it 5 stars. My complaint about it is that Microsoft has their grimy little fingers all over this release. What I mean is that unless you play this on a xbox one x, you wont experience it in 4K resolution but a upscaled version of it. So whether you choose to play on a base PS4 or PS4 Pro its the same thing. Even on the back of the case there is no usual indicator that says 'PS4 Pro Enhanced'. Here is a direct quote from Private Division, 'It includes 4K textures and resolution on Xbox One X and PC, and upsamples to 4K from 1440p on PS4 Pro. ' So use your best judgement on which platform you choose to play this.",5,1,0,145,561,13,194,7,8,72.62,8.28,5.52,11.87
"Everyone was saying over and over that this is what Fallout 76 should have been. Honestly I'm not seeing that or agree with it. It's a fun game for sure, but it's not pulling me in like Fallout ever has. There's a ton of quests, but I find the armor and weapons stats to be confusing as well as the modifications you can do to them. It's like there are too many options for all this. I feel like there is always a huge rush of information coming at you and it takes me out of the enjoyment of playing it. I also wish this was a true open world. You can explore, but only so far. Pretty much all the enemies you kill stay gone for good, so once you've pretty much conquered an area, there is little more to do there. The graphics are ok, but just that. Nothing has really impressed me that much with those. I'm actually kind of disappointed in places where it seems to glitch a little, or if you try to see better details in something (Like your ship) the graphics seem to blur out a little bit. I can do 4k, but I'm pretty sure this game doesn't play in it. I dunno, over all I just don't think it's as amazing as everyone was hyping it would be. I'm still playing but it's been a week since I have, and I don't have a huge desire to jump back in. I will. At some point... When I feel like it.",3,0,3,273,989,13,345,18,4,84.53,5.24,3.55,7.97

"I have found this game to not only be beautiful but also its the best game of the series since reboot. The puzzles are surprisingly challenging and the leveling system works very well. I would agree that in some portions of the game it almost seems like a horror game as they have captured some eerie environments very well. The sound design is exceptional and if you have surround this game takes excellent advantage of the surrounding ambient noises. Controls are pretty tight with some awkward camera goofiness on occasion, but nothing game breaking. The underwater environments are also some of the best of the series and again I cant get over how gorgeous they look! If you have 4K and HDR with a PS4 Pro or an Xbox One S/X you are in for a treat.

"Everything about this game, from the graphics to the load times to the game mechanics themselves screams last gen. Top of it's generation PS3, but PS3 nonetheless. The graphics are more solid (without bad scaling artifacts that plagued the 720p gen for 1080 displays, as we've come to expect for 1080p encodes this gen. But texturing and detail is just not on the level of the latest Assassin's Creed games, Farcry 5, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc, etc. That's not to say it looks at all bad, but I expected better from a game released this late in this generation. Load times are also PS3 level SLOW, and game mechanics in general are firmly rooted in the capabilities and limitations of last gen. Had this game been released the first year the PS4 came out, I wouldn't be so hard on it, as most of the games for the first year or so still seemed to be biased by the previous gen. But I just can't give glowing praise for game based on last gen innovation that was so recently released in 2018. I'm a fanboy of the franchise too, and am grateful that Square Enix continues to develop games based on this version of the character, as I find the current reboot that began last gen to be highly compelling, story wise. But the gameplay itself is devoid of innovation and very plainly behind the times. Recommended for fans of Tomb Raider and Uncharted style games who appreciate following a story, more than for gamers looking for a genuinely ambitious next level gaming experience.",3,0,5,271,1176,31,390,11,12,60.08,11,8.51,14.43

Other than the main story, there is very little else to do in this game. Sure, you can purchase weapons when you get the chance or buy a very limited selection of clothes for the character, but other than that (except trying to locate Playboy magazines or Wanted Posters) the only extra things to do is drive around and shoot innocent people. I would say this game is more of a game you should rent, not purchase just because it is so short.",4,14,1,126,494,7,168,7,7,75.77,7.16,5.61,9.42

The length of the story was a little bit shorter compared to other games, but it was long enough for me and I will keep playing to get all the achievements. The graphics were also better than the games I have played recently. One bad thing that stood out through the game however, is that it is not like GTA because there are almost no side missions. There is free roam, but there is not really a plethora of things to do besides go into clothing stores, gun shops, smash cars, etc. This game also is somewhat easy. I played on hard mode, and I had little trouble. Overall, I think this game was great.",5,11,0,176,702,11,230,10,7,78.41,6.69,5.97,9.54

"Bought this as a gamer and parent for my three year old to enjoy and she does. My favorite part of the experience is how much she enjoys watching. Gameplay is designed for that age level since all you do is move and jump. Levels are pretty similar with different skins. No complex decision making on this one. Levels are not timed. Collectable items in levels are never hidden. This game is just blah. Unless your kid likes paw patrol. Hopefully it helps her hand eye coordination a bit and gets her into other games later.",4,1,0,96,418,9,140,10,4,73.72,5.36,6.72,7.59

"Took an Early Access game, full of bugs out of Early Access to justify paid DLC and an absurd price hike. I purchased ARK about a year ago, on sale for about 13 bucks. This was before Wildcard studios released Scorched Earth, a paid DLC while the game was still in Early Access. Lucky for them, because I wouldn't have given wildcard studios a dime after that. For the money I spent, I had a pretty good time playing on a dedicated private server with friends. The game had a lot of bugs (still does) but I felt the developer was doing a decent job pushing updates. I liked the game enough that I was willing to give the developers more money once the game come out to expand the experience. Then Scorched Earth happened. Instead of fixing bugs, improving stability, or pushing quality updates, etc; Wildcard was building maps to sell to people instead of finishing the game. I guess it could be worse, at least they aren't using loot boxes to push micro-transactions.... yet. Now the game is 'finished' and costs 60 bucks (it was $30-35 when in early access) and it's still a buggy mess. Even worse is they announced a season pass with the first DLC coming out in just a month after Ark's retail release which again shows they spent more time on DLC then finishing the actual game. Wildcard Studios got greedy and lost my business and the business of all my friends. If they would have gone about DLC in a way that wasn't so insulting, I would of happily shown my support through buying their DLCs. If you must experience this game for yourself, wait for a price cut. I wouldn't pay more than $20. Though I would suggest that you give your hard earned cash to a more deserving developer.",1,11,2,317,1331,20,431,18,8,73.94,7.32,7.21,9.57

"I like how in-depth this game gets. I saw it through Neebs Gaming and knew what I was going to be up against when I purchased it. However, for the Xbox one version it is extremely glitchy and some of the textures do not load. I still enjoy playing it, but there needs to be an update or patch that can fix glitches that happen.",4,3,0,66,256,3,83,4,6,83.7,5.68,5.21,8.42
"In Beta game was a blast except for the updates 3 times a day.... now that its released they down for about 1 update a day. Here is the problem now..... If you want to play and have tech support you cant play on a'legacy' server so that forces everyone to play on a official. Well at launch and for the next month or so the servers were all full. So you can even get in, now only weekends are full so dont plan on playing then. The big kicker now is they limit the number of tamed dinos a server can have.... the personal tame limit is like 600 when the server tame limit is like 4000. what does this mean? well it means that like 5-6 people on a 70 person server can cap it out and they did. I have around 10 dinos.... i went to tame more and it wont let me because other people have 400+ so now everyone on server (ragnarok 71) is stuck doing nothing. and tons of people tryin to transfer so the last few new servers are capping. so unless you can play on a private server with friends i wouldnt play this if they paid me.",1,3,1,208,785,7,264,14,4,84.38,5.18,4.4,7.29
"There is no other game like it, and the dev is constantly adding new features which causes regular downtime when he should probably be fixing the existing visual glitches instead.

"ARK really advanced the survival video game genre. Stuff like being able to build and live on a raft fairly early on are one of the many fun features. However players have squatted all the starting areas on every server by claiming land by building pillars and literally walling off the rest of the virtual world from new players. It takes about 4-5 new charter creations on different servers to find a sever with a tiny slice of buildable land when just starting out. Lost is the feeling of waking up on a new world, more like waking up on the shores of an island overdeveloped by player condos. Conan Exiles, bugs and all, still retains that feel of being alone in the wild for the most part, by comparison to ARK.",4,1,0,133,574,11,196,6,10,59.66,10.44,8.24,12.17

The writing is what sets this game apart, I missed the banter between my squad mates that Mass Effect gave me. I missed doing side quests to help my squad mates in things to better their lives.

"Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection on the Switch is a very good compilation of many Street Fighter arcade games in a 10+year time frame (these are all classics so nothing after '99 essentially). The rest comes in the form of soundtracks from the games presented. My favorite part is the huge art gallery they've included in-game to go over little known history, early concepts and more over the 30 years Street Fighter has been around. I'm just a little disappointed that this wasn't labeled 'Arcade Collection' because they're missing out on a lot of other SF releases that would be more fitting under an 'Anniversary Collection' name. However, let me be honest here. The only reason I didn't rush out to get this on any other platform was because I wanted to play Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike on the go because it was my favorite SF game when I was about 15 after discovering it on Dreamcast. I bought it two more times on 360 and PS3 when the HD Online Edition came out but I still needed a TV. Yes, almost exactly 10 years later would I be able to officially play SFIII: 3rd Strike and the other SFIII versions on the go in one game. Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact is my favorite in presentation as it's the only one that holds up in official widescreen. The games are all based on the arcade versions so those used to any console versions (like me) will notice a difference. I still prefer SFIII: 3rd Strike on console but the arcade is good enough for me (even thought the soundtrack is lower quality than the console)! As for the competitive scene, I don't really mind the potential smaller player base on Switch as I'm not an online competitor. I've played fighters casually on arcade all my life and very rarely if ever online. Also one last thing to point out. You can exploit the save system and create a save state during your playthrough. So if you want to get through arcade mode more flawlessly if you lack the skill, you can save before a crucial moment and load it back up if you fail. Overall decent collection for classic fans and those interested in the history of Street Fighter in one compilation.",4,3,0,395,1698,39,569,17,11,61.38,10.47,8.2,13.24

I would recommend it specifically to Street Fighter II fans (along with it's sister game Ultra Street Fighter II, the Final Challengers.). You'll probably want an external controller or fight stick of some kind with this (or even the detached Switch joycons in a controller shell) to play this. If you've never played Street Fighter II all you need to know is that it is the king of 2D fighting games and that doesn't mean it's my personal favorite, but I feel it is an objective assessment (though King of Fighters and others are worthy rivals). Of course, for someone like me, who remembers the long lines for the Street Fighter II cabinet in my college arcade, you might figure I have a particular bias, but the game series is a phenomenon for a reason.",5,1,0,161,708,18,231,6,13,58.22,11.81,8.95,15.21

First the good; U basically have the entire Street Fighter collection as your finger tips including SFIV if you pre-ordered the game which I think was an awesome incentive, but i already own it on Xbox 360, PS3 and PS4. Yes, these are straight arcade ports with minimal options available and this is were the negatives come in. First the button configuration options are bare bones at best, you cannot select the level difficulty of the AI in any of the games, as far as I know anyway, Not enought screen filter options when compaired to previous console ports for some of these games, training mode and online modes are limited to just 4 out of the 12 games, but I can understand why they might've made that decision since people can prepare themselves when they go online for those specific titles. Another small gripe is the bonus material which is all good and stuff, but I noticed they had a page or two where the art content was in there twice? And wish there were more notes about the stories of the games instead of just artwork show or maybe even included a small video documentry about some or all of the titles, now that would've been awesome. At the end of the day I would recommend this game to any fighting game fan or gamer in general, there is a lot do still and of course the games are a blast to play either solo or with friends.",3,1,5,286,1204,26,394,7,19,48.82,16.6,8.23,19.98

The creative control, the customization, and the engine this game runs on are all amazing. I can control all aspects of my player and customize them the way I want. Unlike Fifa, you can edit the teams to whatever you like. The graphics are also super accurate to the players, even though Real Madrid IS FIFA's team, PES still has the better character models. And the game play is solid as always, and with the new abilities the game is much more realistic.

Now im not going to talk about licences because everybody knows that already, the thing that bothers me the most is how ridicilous the superstar difficulty is! It doesnt mather if you are a small team or FC Barcelona, alle teams play as if they are Real Madrid on steroids! Now you can say okay then play on top player difficulty but then the game becomes extremely easy! There is no balance in difficulty! It seems very scripted! I really believe that its one of the best football games when it comes to ball physics and graphics and all the things that matter on the pitch but playing master league becomes extremely annoying when you keep losing because of scripting!",2,2,0,135,601,14,198,7,10,63.18,9.24,8.84,11.86

If I had to choose I would buy PES 2019 over Fifa 2019 just because improvements are very minimal year over year. Konami this year is only supporting current gen system which allowed them to improve graphics over previous years. I suck defending in FIFA and in PES it feels I actually can control my defense vs holding all kind of buttons for second player, protecting, and so forth. In PES you are in control!!!!

But, with option files that's easily sorted. Fifa gameplay is the same year after year. The details in pes are amazing. Recommended.",5,1,0,58,251,8,87,7,4,71.53,5.34,6.07,8.83
"The gameplay in Super Lucky's Tale is ridiculously fun. Alot like mario odyssey but on a smaller scale. Looks great on a TV and in handheld mode. My only complaints are with the difficulty and esthetic. So far its definitely on the easy side. And esthetically is very kiddie. Overall it's still a very fun platformer. Probably a better fit for handheld mode.",5,5,1,65,286,10,106,8,4,60.63,6.82,6.43,9.4

"I bought this game when it released, and can honestly say that it is one of the best platforming games on Switch. It has some challenge for older players, but not too much that a younger child could not play it. A perfect blend of difficulty levels in my opinion. I believe this is a must have game for any Switch owner. It truly is a hidden gem. This game is pure fun.

"It's a great game. I've spent about 3 hours playing so far and it's easy to pick up and play. The controls are easy for anyone. It has interesting characters and an interesting story to keep you invested. The graphics are impressive and vibrant. It's reminiscent of Mario 64 and Donkey Kong Country.

"I'm a LONG TIME classic Mega Man & X fan but I will NOT be supporting physical DAY ONE because how capcom handled Mega Man classic series physical release for Nintendo switch as a REMINDER collection ONE 1-6 is on the game card but collection TWO 7-10 you have to download that. Which is about 5 GB Capcom could have put all 10 games on a slightly bigger sized physical card but instead decided to release physical version CHEAPEST way possible NES games are TINY in memory size. the biggest file would be Mega Man 8 Not to mention many YEARS FROM NOW when collection is long OUT OF PRINT and nintendo eshop is shut down. Switch owners won't able to experience Mega Man legacy collection 2 because with USED games the download code will be redeemed already. Plus downloads have a CERTAIN TIME LIMIT and once that number of months or year has passed then the code voucher is WORTHLESS in my opinion this is what capcom should have done release both collections separately for $20 each Seeing this make me concerned for upcoming X collection 'switch version' this is my PREDICTION X-X4 on a card and X5-X8 downloadable. If that happens to be the case which is most likely then I will just buy X set digitally",3,66,58,224,973,27,325,6,18,46.2,16.09,8.95,19.75

If you think this will be an easy breeze, think again. This was a time when games made you work for them. Now mind you this is easier then megaman, the X series added some help there, but its still hard. There is a new added mode to make it easier for people just starting out, but I haven't tried it to see HOW much easier it makes it. Runs smooth on switch in dock and handheld with no problems. Only complaint I could have, make sure you have internet and some memory space if you want the full game.

This collection of the first 10 Mega Man games is really good to go back and play those wonderful Mega Man games I loved, and a bunch I never got a chance to play. Includes 10 Mega Man games, but note that half the games are digital download with a code included. (Yeah, it's a bummer). This game is great for people looking for a trip down memory lane, for a younger generation to get a chance to play some classics, and for parents to introduce their kids to some quality games with minimal controller inputs.",3,4,1,107,435,12,146,5,9,69.68,8.86,6.72,13.05

"I'm 40 years old. If you remember these games when they first came out. You will not be disappointed. The only issue that i have with this release is not of the game itself. It's the way that it was released and executed by splitting up MM 1-6 and MM 7-10. Also, if you don't have at least 5GB on your system. You won't get the second half of the game since it's only available as a digital code. I like buying physical games still and this was a disappointment. Game play itself is good and the transitions plus difficulties are still there with some cool bonus stuff. The time challenges are worth it because it tests the true die hard fans with extra challenges that even the veteran player will find challenging.

"The first six Mega Man games included on the first collection are all pretty dang good, and the 'rewind' feature included on them (you can simply hit the L button to reverse time and redo a tricky jump or tough boss) as well as the ability to save anywhere lessen the crushing difficulty substantially and make them way more fun! The second collection is missing the rewind and save features and is much more of a mixed bag in terms of game quality. It's also a download code, which is frustrating. Still, the strength of the first collection makes it worth owning!

Also, there's no getting around the fact that this is two separate games stapled together in one collection; the UIs between the two are distractingly different. Notably absent is the Super Famicom version of Mega Man & Bass That said..this is the best way to play Mega Mans 1-10.

"All 10 of mega man's adventures in one compilation perfectly emulated as far as I can tell. It does suck that 7, 8, 9 and 10 are not on the game cartridge but you will overlook that once you start playing and enjoying this pack.

"It is so great to have the classic Mega Man titles on the Swtich! The minor gripe I have with this is that Legacy Collection 2 (which is games 7-10) are an internet download and not included on the cart. I really wish Capcom wasn't so cheap. Making the cart with just a few more GB of storage would have made all ten games fit and then no internet download would be required at all. So in the end: great games, frustrating 'physical' product due to so many being just downloads.",3,1,0,93,375,8,123,5,7,76.07,7.27,6.32,10.88
"If you are a megaman fan definitely pick this game up. 10 games for a low price, plus there are additional features like challenges and art galleries.

"Nintendo Switch is the perfect platform for the Mega Man series. As a Mega Man lifer I've enjoyed the series in both home console and portable devices throughout the series' lifetime.

"This could have been on one cartridge. I could care less about the challenge modes and music players.I am sure many people would have been fine omitting those features to cram the game on a smaller cartridge. We also don't need the cloths. They could also make the artwork single sided. I am sure removing said things could have helped bring production costs down a bit to allow stuff to fit or allow for a bigger cart. If you buy digitally, you are giving them more of a reason to allow these 'physical' copies. They want you to buy digitally. I suggest getting the collection on the Gamecube, Xbox, PS2, or the original cartridges. Hold on to your Wii for 9 and 10. I didn't buy Resident Evil, LA, WWE, and NBA. I bought the Japanese Climax Edition of Bayonetta. As of now, Mega Man 11 and the Street Fighter Collection are safe. Those I will be buying. **** However, you can buy Mega Man X Collection 2 physically from Japan.",1,14,13,173,726,18,245,15,5,75.32,5.62,6.31,8.78

Already own these 2 collections on the PS4 & the 1st one released on the 3DS yet, this Switch one is my go to by far! This also has MegaMan amiibo support like the 3DS for extra challenges. The extra content & features of these collections are phenomenal! Absolutely amazing for any Classic series MegaMan fan! Seriously can not wait for the MegaMan X Legacy Collections due out this July & MegaMan 11 this Winter!

"This was a beautiful piece that really rewards fans of the genre and the series. After getting a chance to play it, I have fallen in love with Megaman and the platforming genre all over again. I love the rewind feature where you can erase your mistakes in an instant using the L trigger on the joy con, essentially allowing you to play through the levels quickly. It was a nice surprise to find what was inside the case. Not only is there some physical swag, but a nice little boost to my Nintendo gold coins as well (cartridge + download = 115 gold coins). All in all, couldn't be happier and is one of the best purchases for my Switch I've made thus far. Also picking up the Megaman amiibo to find out what the title menu will reward me with. Can't wait to find that out. Pick this up if you at all like platformers.",5,2,3,158,642,13,214,9,7,74.43,7.24,6.41,10.31

"Only resident evil zero is on the cartridge, download code for Resident Evil 1. I've only played resident evil zero so far, so this review is concerning that title. Good game for resident evil fans. New players, such as myself won't like the controls, old and outdated. No ability to aim. Worst part of the game is loading screens every time you enter or exit a door. So half the time spent playing is loading screens. Would have though they could have updated the game by now to remove all these loading screens. The game also contains lots of puzzles, internet is your friend. You will most likely need to lookup the solution as the game provides zero hints or explanation for some of them and they are illogical (Stopping the train brakes). If you are a resident evil fan you will probably like this. If not, but still want to try a resident evil game, try the resident evil 1+2 revelations collection, as they are much better games.",4,1,5,172,743,18,249,12,7,69.81,7.08,7.54,9.92
"This is a short & sweat review Let me start by saying yes the game has been in development for 4 years which In return is the same time it took to develop top tier games like halo gears of war ect ect... with that being said if you go into this game expecting a game on par with halo god of war & GTA 5 you will be let down. If youve played the original crackdown & liked it you will love this one. Crackdown 3 does not deserve all bad reviews its getting from critics. The multiplayer mode wreaking zone is ok in short burst but could use some server & stability patches. Now the main story is a lot of fun especially in coop. Its a great game to just jump in wreck stuff up jump around & collect some orbs to power up your agent. My best advice is be your own review & dont listen to the bad critic reviews that are bashing it because of delays & gameplay not being much different from the original which I think its what makes crackdown crackdown. I bought the game day 1 & really am enjoying it I suggest at least give it a try on game pass to see if its worth a purchase.",4,7,1,210,840,13,275,9,10,72.37,8.96,6.45,11.81

No, but it's rewarding overcoming the challenges in getting to the top of structures and getting a particularly difficult orb or turning off a propaganda tower. The jumps and your handling feel crisp and smooth, and when you fall, it's your fault. Overall, the game does exactly what it sets out to do: deliver a tongue in cheek, fun experience. I put about 20 hours in so far, and I have enjoyed every minute. Haven't touched multiplayer, but the campaign is great.",4,2,0,121,509,16,172,9,6,72.93,6.43,6.73,10.67

"Seriously, this game is a ton of fun. Unlike the disappointment that was Crackdown 2, this is the true sequel to Crackdown 1. While some have complained about the graphics, Crackdown 3 looks excellent on the Xbox One, particularly on the Xbox One X in native 4K resolution & HDR. When it comes to the city, the way the character moves, the way you interact with things, the way the vehicles transform -- though they transform differently than in Crackdown 1, etc., this is the true successor to Crackdown 1. The movement feels so good, too. Whether you're fighting enemies or climbing a tall building, everything just feels smooth. Crackdown was always a mix of open world Grand Theft Auto mayhem, mixed with a superhero movie, mixed with Mario-style platforming, and that's all on display here. You will level up your agility by collecting the oh so addictive orbs, you will level up strength by picking up objects & throwing them at your enemies, you will level up driving by completing races, by driving stylishly, by using your vehicles to down your foes, etc., and on and on. I disagree wholeheartedly with the negativity surrounding this game. Crackdown 3 is by no means a letdown. If you wanted a prettier version of Crackdown 1 with new abilities, more orbs, better graphics, a good framerate, etc., then look no further than Crackdown 3.",5,2,1,232,1069,27,348,14,9,63.12,8.57,9.51,11.28

Explosions, guns, etc all sound great. The Xbox One X upgrades are awesome as well. The co-op is great, and the multi-player is out of control fun.

"Purchased the 1st crackdown day of release and was blown away. Superhero GTA while searching for random orbs was awesome. Fast forward to 2019 and pre-ordered this thinking not only was there going to be explosions but building were going to crumble down....until I read the reviews which are pretty much correct. There was so much more potential this game could have had and I'm sad after just 3-4 days, 4-5 hours a day with 110 hidden orbs and 400 agility orbs found I've completed the game. The driving is just as bad and feels exactly the same from 2007? Come on Microsoft Studios couldn't the driving have been improved some? Its a better polished version of the 1st game with a few cool new weapons but not much else. The NPC's seem to be randomly located even on the top of some buildings that have no entryway to top which is odd. It seems to me the developers never attempted to play any of the new gen games to get a better grasp on how to improve the driving or NPC behavior. GTA 3 liberty City on PS2 had more lifelike characters running around the city. Overall if you can look past the small details in the game and have never played the crackdown series then pick this game up when it drops some in price.",3,1,0,235,971,17,318,12,8,72.48,8.02,6.98,10.73

"Let's begin with the following: I bought into the Minecraft Beta when it first hit PC, and after various attempts, could never get into it like those who do enjoy it. Lego Worlds, while being compared to Minecraft, is different enough that it's kept my interest and keeps me looking forward to it. While I rounded up to a 5, I may have given it a 4... Technically, it's far from perfect, but there's just too much fun to be had to really let the technical (and some blatant lack of instruction,) knock it down. Now, one of the things I didn't know or wasn't presented in a couple pre-release stories that you SHOULD BE AWARE OF: you do NOT start with a complement of all the Lego pieces. So, if you believe you're gonna fire it up and begin building, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. In fact, it's a very big time sink to start discovering all the various individual bricks and builds before hitting up the free build section of creating your own world. Keep this in mind. Really, this game can be broken down into several parts. To start, there's the exploration segment: you'll fly your ship to a World and explore the area. Each 'biome' is chock full of goodies. For the younger crowd, this plays like much of the other Lego games. Punch things and collect studs while searching for gold bricks- some, like various other discoveries, will be found in chests, others will be earned by running various errands. Another aspect of the game is the collecting. Your explorer has a little collection gun that will copy various discoveries (think flora & fauna) to your inventory for use when you begin your own worlds. Copying these only adds them to your inventory, you'll still need to unlock them by purchasing it (one time pay with your collected studs,) before you can actually use them. You'll also earn other tools- a 'copy' tool that you can use to copy large builds- that giant Sphinx that isn't a pre-existing piece can't be used with the collector, but can be copied, so you won't have to try & build one from scratch. You'll also have tools that remove terrain/ segments of the world for you to find hidden treasure chests, build tools that can reconstruct builds or individual brick by brick that you've collected. You'll also have little chase segments; to earn many of the individual bricks, as you wander the various worlds, a cutesie green 'troublemaker' will occasionally pop out of the ground, carrying either a new brick to earn or a gold brick. Chase him down and tackle him, and he'll cough up the piece. Once you've tired of a particular biome, enter your spaceship and find a new one to explore. There are issues. Inventory can quickly become messy, even with the divisions they have. There's just soooo much Lego here, that it quickly becomes a chore to locate particular items you may need in a timely fashion. I play on PS4, perhaps it's something the Pro or a PC more easily handles, but there are times, especially once you start using vehicles, where you'll get to the end of the rendered biome, but need to wait while it renders the rest (this isn't a huge issue, but needs to be recognized). At one point, the game didn't create the new biomes for me to fly to after unlocking the medium sized biomes, which worked itself out after a restart. (Note that you'll have to tell the game to locate a new biome from the spaceship map, biomes won't just spontaneously show up). There been a few times that while using a tool or weapon, the game suddenly switches it to the collection tool and won't allow me to put it away or switch. (Rectified by the ultra-handy 'parachute' option, which is there for if your character gets stuck in terrain- which is funny, because I've had to use it for the tool-failure more times than the one time I've gotten stuck on terrain). Also, the lantern will occasionally lose its glow, which is a huge negative if you're underground. (Rectified by zooming in, then out with the camera). While the game has quite a list of technical issues, these will hopefully be patched out over time: still, even if they aren't, the game really is one that will have you looking at the clock and wondering where the past 4-5 hours have gone. There is also multiplayer, both couch co-op and online, with perhaps the best feature being that you can share your created Worlds/biomes in the Lego Galaxy that others can visit (just make sure you set it that changes are NOT saved- ensuring you don't come back to multiple hours of planning and building, only to find it destroyed by visitors). While the lack of having the full Lego sets to play with out of the box may be frustrating to some; to others, the HUGE timesink involved in hunting down all the thousands of pieces may be too much, the fact remains that they have made the hunt FUN. The other bonus is just how different the game can be played. I've played with my 4 year old, who's just learning his 'inner gamer' and has some experience with other Lego games. The basic running around and stud collecting is in his wheelhouse, and with me playing alongside him, none of the few fights were difficult. This base experience is great for the younger crowd, and one that can be expanded as the young ones get older and more comfortable with the advanced portions. (I'm currently hunting down as much as possible to let him have a large selection to build his own little world with). And, while that hunt is fun, and can still get a bit repetitive, where else could you get every (non-licensed) Lego piece, unlimited in number, for $30? The price alone, at half the cost of a regular release, is absolutely worth it. Even with the list of current issues, I wouldn't have been disappointed had it been a full priced release. There's just so much to explore, so much to do and see, that the list of glitches is easily overlooked, as none are game-breaking.",5,0,1,1101,4594,98,1527,43,12,63.51,10.76,7.58,13.8

"I've been a big fan of Suda51's work since Killer 7 and the original No More Heroes games; I've given other games a shot, such as Lollipop Chainsaw, Liberation Maiden, Sine Mora, and Let it Die. To call this a No More Heroes game while not adopting the game play is just a minor blemish on an otherwise extremely playable title. There are tropes here and there (like charging the Beam Sword) that evoke classic NMH, but they're pretty superficial. The real gripes I have is that the graphical style isn't great, and looks very dated; the music is OK but repetitious, and the levels are needlessly long, and aren't really designed with any pizzazz. But despite all that, it's still quite fun, the cutscenes are goofy and bizarre, and the aesthetic is classic No More Heroes with a mixture of 70's cinema, anime, and retro video games. It works well and is intentionally jarring all at once. It also makes me nostalgic for Killer 7. Really, the name of the game should be Suda51 Strikes Again, because it really shares that disjointed, conflicting DNA that all of his games share.",4,2,0,199,852,22,292,8,12,57.45,11.43,8.18,14.37

"This game is not a game I could recommend to just anyone, that doesn't mean it's bad, you just have to approach it with a specific mindset to get the most out of it. If that mindset is being an adoring fan of Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture's previous work, then you'll probably love the game and all of its wackiness. If you have no idea who/what Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture is, then consider a few things before purchasing. First off, I hope you have a big TV, because at many points during the action, the camera perspective will be so zoomed out from the characters that it can be hard to distinguish what's going on. Second, hopefully you have someone you can enjoy the game with in local cooperative multiplayer, as there's more fun to be had that way in choosing how to handle certain combat situations and deciding who gets to use what special abilities and so on. Lastly, you're probably not going to enjoy the story. It's a direct continuation from the first two 'No More Heroes' games, there's plenty of references to other games as well, and meta-references to video games as a whole. The narrative is mostly presented in lengthy sections of text, some of which are displayed in a deliberately 'old-school' computer graphics style with pixelated fonts and a green-text/black-background aesthetic that can be very harsh on the eyes. If you can stomach that, there's some pretty solid arcade style action underneath all that that's worth playing around with.",3,3,2,271,1181,36,405,9,15,49.84,13.79,8.84,17.36

While this one is a bit of a smaller scope than the first two, they still manage to pack so much love and personality into this title as they did with the previous ones along with a fun story that really ties everything together. Gameplay is very simply, but with enough depth that becomes necessary to master on higher difficulties. There's also a strong emphasis on 2-player co-operative play that, while not required, adds a fair bit to your playthrough(s).

"If you like the WarioWare series you will love this. Many great added levels. For the fantastic 'Sneaky Gamer' alone, worth it. If you never played Warioware, this is addictive fun.

And, the greatest bonus of all: get every unlock-able and open up a big, deep turn-based card game called 'Wario Kard' (get it?) This game will give you over 100 hours of great quality gaming.

"This game stays true to its formula. WarioWare Gold has you doing microgames; which are short tasks like chopping a vegetable, jumping over an obstacle, skiing down a hill, answering a question, doing a picture puzzle, etc. It sounds simple, with each microgame taking about 4 seconds to complete, but with each round things get faster and trickier. Mess up four times and it's game over. Being on the 3ds you will be using the stylus, blowing into the mic, tilting the 3ds, and of course using the d-pad and buttons. This game is rated E for everyone, but Wario has a persona like no other so expect his crude humor to be front and center. This is a full retail priced game. The story mode is short, however playing until you unlock every microgame (there are 300 of them!) plus unlocking all the bonus games and collectables will have you playing for hours.",5,1,0,156,680,13,227,9,8,66.14,8.34,8.12,10.27
"I haven't played a WarioWare in a very, very long time, but there is a certain charm to these games. It's very weird, but very fun. The presentation is excellent as the characters come alive with full voice acting (I strongly believe that voices give greater life to something than just an image of them). Highly recommended and perhaps of the one last major original (non-port) first-party releases on the 3DS this year (or the years to come).",5,1,0,82,350,7,119,4,9,63.25,9.53,7.85,11.61

"Wario Ware gold is a nice entry to cap off the series up to this point. It's crammed full with most of the best microgames of the series, which is nice since the DIY and Wii U entry left a bit to be desired for fans of the series. Honestly the only downside to this game is that it would have been great to get it on the Switch. But since a lot of the games use the two screens and mix of buttons and touch screens I understand why they didn't. It has all the characters you expect, and fully voiced too. Besides the great selection of microgames, there's a lot of other fun side content too, though unlocking them is kind of weird with a capsule minigame to get them. One of the more amusing side features is one where Wario will draw any amiibo you scan that isn't third party or Pokemon characters. They are pretty funny, and be sure to scan Wario amiibo if you have it. Otherwise you know what you're going to get, a best of WarioWare with all the good mini games from the Original, and DS entries. If you enjoyed any of the previous games, and still have your 3DS, I would definitely pick it up.",4,0,1,219,863,19,292,10,9,71.81,8.68,6.02,12.23

"Mortal Kombat has rejoined the ranks of great fighting games. I was koncerned about the future of this series, but those koncerns evaporated when I played this game. The action is fast-paced, brutal and exciting, the graphics are outstanding and look great in HD and the kontrols are easy enough to pick up, you'll be executing krazy kombos and brutal fatalities before you know it. Rather than trying to make this into a 3D fighter, Netherrealm has made it into a top notch 2D fighter in 3D environments. The gameplay harkens bact to the klassic Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3, which were the best games in the series up until this one. There are lots of game modes, from one-on-one and tag team fighting to various mini-games. There is even a story mode which is a dramatic retelling of the events of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy. In the story, Raiden recieves a message from his future self that evil warlord Shao Khan must not succede or the Earthrealm is doomed. there are twists and turns that give this mode the feel of an interactive movie. The great kharacters from the original klassics are back. The kharacter designs are striking and distinctive. From terrifying kombatant like Baraka and Quan Chi, to heroes like Liu Kang and Johnny Cage and sexy female fighters like Jade and Sonya Blade. If you have a favorite kharacter from MK, chances are he or she (or it) is in this game. This is a great game, but not for family entertainment. Mortal Kombat is graphically violent. there is a lot of blood and gore and some particularly graphic finishing moves. For players 17 and older, it's a great game but it is not recommended for children. Mortal Kombat warrants its M rating. For brutal 2D fighting, Mortal Kombat kan't be beat.

I personally didn't care for the story and found Jessie to be a rather bland protagonist compared to Remedy's past works. Think of the core level design as Metriodvania, You can go back to past areas you've cleared and such. The level design towards the very end of the game is sloppy because there are enemies spamming projectiles, both in the air and on the ground, towards you and the game doesn't provide sufficient cover to deal with it.

This is my first experience with Animal Crossing, and it's proven to be among the most relaxing games I've played. I must say that the formula works well on the 3DS. It's something you can choose to really dig into, but I've found it also works well if you just play for an hour or so each day. Time in-game reflects real time, so if you're a night owl, you may find it somewhat annoying that shops close over the course of the evening and don't re-open until the next morning. That said, collecting items, outfits, furniture, and even helping the townsfolk with their basic 'get me this item' tasks is surprisingly enjoyable. A nice, low-pressure game that should appeal to fans craving for a more laid-back slice-of-life experience. Also, Isabelle is super cute.",5,6,1,179,722,15,246,9,8,70.38,8.38,6.43,11.31
"Ive been playing this game since its release day and I still love it. I even have 3 bugs left to catch and Ive had SIX YEARS to complete everything. I love the real time game play, the music, the sounds, the thunderstorms, the shooting stars, the footprints, the tournaments, the holidays. I will continue to play it nearly daily until New Horizons comes out next year. Im 39 and love it. I gave it to an 8 year old and she loves it. Its great for everyone.",5,4,0,88,356,7,116,7,4,82.56,4.87,5.63,8.21
"Being an owner of AC City Folk on the Wii, I enjoy this franchise. But the odd controls and home-console functionality meant that I never played it that often. This game takes many of City Folk's problems away. AC works perfectly on a dual-screen handheld because I can check on it whatever time of day I want, and not just at home. Now I finally have the incentive to actually play every day. They call this game 'New Leaf' for a reason. It starts out similar to the old games; Rover welcomes you on a train, Tom Nook puts you into debt, etc. However, there's now a big turn in gameplay. Much rather than just being a mere villager, you now are the mayor of your own town. Now you can make public works projects, set ordinances, and have a cute dog named Isabelle as your secretary. There's all sorts of things to do. You can go fishing, talk with your fellow villagers, go shopping, pull weeds (WARNING: Weeds easily trigger people with OCD. Proceed with caution.), and more. If you need a break, you can veg out at the tropical Tortimer Island. This game is brimming with content. The 3DS also has amiibo functionality where you can get free items and villagers via amiibo cards and figures. All my useless cards were sitting around, gathering dust, so this is a great way to get one specific villager you want. Overall, this game is brimming with content. It has aged very well throughout it's lifetime. Those who are into vigorous gaming will probably get bored easily. However, I personally use it to relieve stress. If I get angry about a game, Animal Crossing will do the trick. While it doesn't really have a main 'end goal,' I still enjoy this time-killer. Many are upset that it's been several years since a real AC game has been released, but at least we can enjoy this gem until the time comes. This is yet another great game that doesn't even cost more than $20.",5,5,1,352,1470,35,501,26,6,72.68,6.48,6.57,9.39
"I recently got this game at Best Buy last year after hearing all the hype. I really started playing it a few months ago. However, I dont see how its incredible in any way. I'll admit, it is addicting, but it is so obvious the game creators made it that way on purpose. Almost everything is 'Wait until tomorrow'. And most of the shops close early, as a college student, the only time I get to play video games is at night and not even everyday! And the game penalizes you if you miss days. There are so many rules and so many things you can not do. For example, you cant start a new public work project the same day another one is completed, nor can you rotate your public work project (like a bench for example). And you can not buy multiples of things. For example if you want a red rose flower, you can only buy one until its available again! Ive heard people clocking in more than 500 hours into this game, I have done 40 and truly feel like this is my limit. I enjoyed it at first, but past the 40 hours, I feel like theres nothing left to do. I've decorated my town, and feel pretty satisfied with it (and that's saying alot because I love creating.) Decorating my home feels like a hassle compared to my experience with The Sims, where it's so easy to create and build. And yeah the animal villagers are cute and all, but I find this game hard to enjoy as a college age kid. HOWEVER, I must admit, when I was 10 or so, when I was obsessed with my DS Lite, I would have loved this game. But not at this age. I just personally dont enjoy this game, but it seems like it's great for little kids.",2,2,0,318,1238,27,431,19,6,75.18,6.93,5.32,10.09

"Animal Crossing New Leaf is the current latest in the Animal Crossing series, and I can't think of a better entry point, especially at the game's MSRP. If you've never played an Animal Crossing title, the best way to describe the games is a relaxed life simulator. You can catch bugs, go fishing (my favorite activity), do gardening, or just walk around in the in-game world talking to your animal neighbors every so often. There is no true main objective - so unless you set goals for yourself, it's a title you pop in whenever you feel like kicking back and just taking things easy. I would suggest getting the game digitally now that it's so cheap. I own a physical copy, but I don't play it as often as I'd like since I don't always have it in the system when carrying it.",5,1,0,152,607,14,215,6,11,61.46,10.98,6.51,13.82

The story is new, genuine, and interesting. There are definitely challenging moments and you feel very accomplished for overcoming boss fights or getting ambushed. The only complaint is how the gun can lose consistent placement. Meaning its not quite being held how I'm holding it and so I'll have to try and change weapons or lower the weapon and bring it back up with the hope to recalibrate it in a manner of speaking.

"The fact that this title was put into the hands of the same veterans who pioneered the original Donkey Kong Country trilogy definitely shines through the quality of the design. Pros: Lot of collectibles for each level with lots of challenges because these are not just handed to you. Lots of puzzle-solving on the overworld map which is unique for the genre. Gameplay draws a lot of inspiration from DK: Tropical Freeze (which definitely isn't a bad thing). Cons: Difficulty curve could have been less or at least had lower difficulty options. More personality and enemy variety would have helped. Overall though, it's an amazing game and is well worth your cash. Well-played, Playtonic!",5,3,0,118,555,21,185,8,9,59.23,8.66,9.85,13.02

"Lovely graphics, tight controls, fun collectables, and a charming overworld packed with humorous characters and secrets. You get 20 levels that each have one bee (think of a Moon from Super Mario Odyssey), and five special coins (just like the KONG letters in the Donkey Kong Country series). Each level has an alternate form that you must unlock via manipulation of the overworld environment. That leaves 40 levels combined along with the 'Impossible Lair'. The Impossible Lair is a mega-level with no check-points. The gimmick is that every bee you rescue will act as a shield. So if you have 20 bees then you can take 20 hits. This level is as unpleasant as you'd expect a villain's impossible lair to be, and leaves an overall great game feeling sour towards the end.",4,4,1,137,616,14,201,8,9,65.33,8.4,8.91,10.94

"As a lifelong fan of the Castlevania games, I've played them on the NES, Super Nintendo, Playstation, Gameboy Advance, Playstation 2, Nintendo DS, and more. Some of the best titles of all time are in the Castlevania franchise- Symphony of the Night being one of the progenitors of its own genre, Metroidvania. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is like unto Castlevania Symphony of the Night meets Order of Ecclesia- and that carries all of the positive connotations it possibly could. The character, environmental, and sound design are all top notch and clearly make this a game that must be experienced if you're even remotely a fan of Metroidvanias. The level design is superb and you'll find yourself backtracking and finding all sorts of secrets, which is accompanied by phenomenal movement that makes traversing locations a joy. There are tons of little, interesting things to find, plus there's crafting and cooking on top of it. However, the Switch version ain't it, chief. At release, this game has tremendous issues- visual effects missing and insanely low quality textures are just the tip of the iceberg (even the rose tattoo of Miriam, the character on the box art, can sometimes show as a splotchy, pixelated mess not even visually representing a flower. That's how low quality the textures can present). This version of the game crashes a lot, which is wholly unacceptable for a game that doesn't have auto-saves. Sometimes you can crash while selecting the bookcase that *lets you save the game*! It's insanely frustrating to lose progress repeatedly due to game bugs. Notwithstanding, the frame rate is also quite low- it's 30fps in some locations, while dipping to as low as 15 in others, like the tower. This is probably one of the best games I've played in recent memory. Unfortunately, this just isn't a good port of that great game. Keep an eye out for updates that hopefully improve playability (fps, crashing needs to be at the top of the list of things to fix). If you only have a Switch, still consider this version after waiting a bit. This game is fantastic, even if I'm negative over the bugs this product shouldn't have, and those problems hopefully get patched. If you absolutely can't wait to play, the PC version of the game on Steam would likely give you the best experience.",3,6,0,407,1843,61,623,19,11,55.59,10.83,9.44,14.56
"Reviews are out that the Switch port is pretty bad compared to the other ports. They need some time to maybe fix it so I would hold off till then. PS the steelbox sucks also.

"Preordered this (at Gamestop because I got a deal, usually do everything BestBuy) and it looks really bad. Like sad bad. FPS issues dip AT LEAST into the 20s after a few hours in as well. Loading times are annoying, had the game crash a few times too. Get the Ps4 version. YES I know this would be more fun to play on the go...but it's just not worth it here.",1,5,1,73,275,6,94,7,2,87.31,3.67,3.51,7.46
"The devs promised to patch it post launch but this is unacceptable. You can actually play and complete the game, its not 100% broken, but please read the following. This version of the game was clearly not complete. The game is a blurry mess when the switch is more the capable of rendering clearly, i look like a 3DS game in resolution. The ugly muddy mess is just the start of bad news. They messed up on the descaling of the Original textures for the switch so they look blocking chunky and blurry. The next issue is the INPUT LAG, a lot of the game you have 3x more input lag, this means sometimes your combos for some weapons dont go off, or that you jump and miss attacks. It feels like you are playing the game underwater. Sluggish and unresponsive. This needs to be fixed. Next is the constant crashing. On the other versions of the game they had some minor issues they patched the next day. You might crash 3 times in a whole 20 hour play through on the other version. On the switch version you can crash up to 20 times in one play through. That meaasn losing 30 or more min of progress each time if your unlucky. The FPS was locked at 30. Which would be fine if it was stable. The game has dips down to 10 FPS when lots of action is going on on screen. And the resolution in handheld is 720p but in docked its also only 720p but also dynamic so it can be WORSE then playing it in handheld mode. The rumble was also broken, in that the rumble might trigger and never stop until you reset the game. And it revs it up to max so it feels like it might break your joycons. Last there is some issues that the physical cart might run worse then the Digital download version. The Physical cart might run worse because the game was not properly optimized. This game and its 3d effects should be able to run 60fps and 900p on the switch. Many games that push the hardware more look better and run better then this version of the game. Smash brothers, mario Kart, MK11, Wolfenstien, Doom. SKyrim, and many more run way better. Its a software issue on the fault of 505 games and Igas Art play, they did not know how to optimize the game for switch. it may be months before its in a proper state if you buy this version.",1,4,1,426,1749,21,555,29,6,81.71,5.51,6.33,7.85

"To begin, I've never played any Castlevania game, except for the very first one on the NES. I'm not familiar with Symphony of the Night or any other title similar to this one. This game caught my eye after I played Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon on PC. First, the good. The game feels nice. Movement is great. You have a lot of weapons to choose from to change your play style a little bit. The levels are fun to look at and have a lot of secrets, like hidden items and rooms in walls. Hitting enemies is satisfying, bosses are fun, and there's a lot of things to do. Crafting, making food, and enhancing equipment will keep you busy for a while. Then, we have some problems. Gameplay-wise, sometimes you get lost. It's not exactly super clear where you're supposed to go, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can be time consuming. That's about the only complaint about the game itself. The biggest flaw about this game is the port itself. You get 30fps on average, and in some areas such as the Tower of the Twin Dragon, the game gets really choppy. The graphics are also pretty mediocre. But my biggest problem with this game is that sometimes it crashes. It doesn't happen often, but I've crashed a few times, and I have to re-do everything from my last save. If you're not careful and find yourself in a long stretch in the game without saving, you could crash and lose all of your progress. So basically, save whenever you can and wherever you can. Hopefully this particular problem can be solved with patches and updates, because this is a really good game, but not a great port. Overall, the core game itself is great. But it has its fair share of technical issues which makes me not able to rate it much higher than 3/5 at this time.",3,3,0,336,1369,26,460,24,5,76.8,6.02,6.04,8.7

"Bloodstained is a decent game, but the Switch version is plagued by performance issues. Im generally not someone that is all that sensitive to frame rate drops, but Bloodstained has some of the more egregious frame rate drops that Ive seen. The game also has poor load times when dong simple things like traveling between rooms. There were a few times where I would jump off of a platform at the top of one room and it would be several seconds before the screen would show me coming up from the bottom of the next room. A few times it was so bad that I thought the game froze. These issues occurred whether I played in hand-held mode or connected to my tv using the dock, and I split my time pretty evenly between them. As for the game itself, overall I think enjoyed it. The visuals are good during gameplay, but the cut scenes look really low-res. The combat is generally fun and there are a lot of weapons and powers that you experiment with until you find what works best for you. I think the amount of shards is probably s little overkill though and I think a lot of people will stick to only using a few different ones. If you are big on story games, I dont think Bloodstained will hold your attention in that area, but this game is more about combat and exploration. Speaking of exploring, youll need to do a lot of that. There were a few times where I wasnt sure where to go and had thought I missed a clue from a character. A couple times I was so confused that I had to consult the Internet in what I was supposed to do next. I tend to try and avoid this on my first play through of a game because I like to have my own experience and dont want to risk spoilers, but o was just wandering around aimlessly. All in all, Id say that the game is good on combat and exploration and is a nice homage to games like Symphony of the Night. The weaker aspects s are the story and the performance issue make me not want to recommend it for the Switch (at least at the time of this review)",3,1,0,387,1573,32,509,17,10,72.46,8.81,6.8,12.41

The game as of launch for the switch is a bit of a disappointment as well with all the bugs and glitches.

"I've been waiting since 1999. I am not disappointed. I picked up my Switch copy yesterday with the metal case. I was so happy and eager. On my way home I read all sorts of negative commentary. That scared me a bit but I was ready for it. I played the game last night just past the first boss-level character. This game is great! The graphics are clean and crisp. I love the artwork and illustrative style of the gameplay. Miriam, the main playable character, is very interactive compared to SOTN. I was impressed because I thought they would keep it all as basic as possible. Certain equipment changes show up on the character in-game and some down. Once you give me a little I want the whole lot, but I understand and accept the limits here. When you change the headdress or scarf you can see the character outfit change. She can even wear masks!! As for the dress, I have changed these body items a few times but the character's dress never changes. That's fine. Back in the day, no changes in outfit reflected in the character except for the cloak... and that was amazing! So having more control over the design is a pretty cool feature. I also love the postures the character Miriam takes with different weapon styles. I changed some buttons around in my game to better suit my style of gameplay. Playing on the switch, whether on my 50in television or handheld, is highly enjoyable. The first thing I was looking for was the opening score. I was satisfied. I am looking forward to playing this game until my fingers fall off! I plan on getting another copy as a gift to a relative for their PS4. It could possibly look better in some way but I can't imagine what that should look like. I;m looking forward to my next boss battle. CONS: I have no cons to list but I am aware of the frame-rate complaints. I was totally fine with this as it seems very normal to me, especially in this game. I seriously feel transported back in time with better tech. The game was meant to carry on that feeling, not meant to make a modern beefy version of the Igavania style. Also, only once so far had I noticed a slow down when a ton of things were happening on screen. Whenever stuff like that happens I tend to think I am like Neo in The Matrix. I get happy about it, not sad. Hope this helps.",5,1,3,435,1797,37,599,38,4,78.72,5.12,5.9,7.98

The loading times for this game on the Switch is atrocious for a cartridge based game. If I knew about all of this I would have gotten the other console version.

"Hideo Kojima is rarity in the world of high-budget video game production. Hes an auteur. The Metal Gear Solid games are all branded A Hideo Kojima Game. He has a certain sensibility, but there has also always been a sense in his games that hes been held back. That was before he left Konami and formed his own independent studio, Kojima Productions, which just released its first game - Death Stranding. Describing this game is a challenge. The core gameplay loop is pretty simple. You play as a courier, and you have to walk from point A to point B without falling and damaging your cargo too much. There are hazards - rough terrain, bandits out to steal your cargo, and other enemies. Its more challenging than it sounds, but Id be lying if I said it wasnt at times tedious. The real draw here, as it has been for me with Kojimas other games, is the story. Death Stranding tells you both too much and not enough about the world the game takes place in. The first few hours of the game have only about half an hour of actual gameplay, with the rest of the time spent showing you the post-apocalyptic America that youll traverse throughout the game. When I bought my copy of Death Stranding, the cashier said that he had sold the game to two other people that day, and that neither one of them could tell him what the game was about. I told him, Ill be surprised if any of us can tell you what its about after weve finished it. I stand by that. When you buy Call of Duty 16, or Madden 2020, you know exactly what youre getting. What you get in Death Stranding is something you dont get in many high profile games - something different. Something new. Its weird. Its kinda boring. Its borderline nonsense. But its beautiful. It knows what it is and isnt afraid to be just that. And thats what keeps me playing.",4,15,4,336,1428,27,460,25,6,77.37,5.81,6.99,8.59
"I play games very casually and only finish about two or so a year. My favorites in recent years and the type that appeal to me are Horizon Zero Dawn, Metal Gear Solid 5, the newer Tomb Raider games, and The Last Guardian, Ico, and Shadow of the Colossus. All that said -- I love this game. I'm having such a good time. I love it love it. The environments are beautiful and traveling through them can be very mellow, but it's still challenging in a way that helps you engage with the main character. Story beats (I'll give no real details here) are intriguing and amusing in their shifting tones. I very much enjoy Hideo Kojima's voice and story style, and this one is not letting me down. Basically I enjoy a good game that gives an engaging story and gives a fulfilling world/environment to explore so I have something to do while I listen to a podcast or other audiothing. Hours and hours into this game, I often don't feel the need to listen to something else while I'm playing, and I'm happy to just be immersed in the world and sounds that are presented. Every element already feels deliberate and with artful authorial intent, so I don't necessarily feel like I'm 'wasting my time' by not supplementing with another piece of media while also playing around in this one. The game in itself just feels like a masterfully-crafted album. I'm not too big on games where most all you do is shoot at things and people. I don't enjoy feeling consistently tensed up and stressed or frustrated while playing a game. And striking that balance where there's not too much constant over-stimulation and aggression but it's also still very immersive and gripping -- it's honestly hard for me to define what exactly that balance consists of when a game properly hits it for me (like most of the titles I listed above). But this one does so maybe just about the most perfectly I've found in this PS4 era. That feels like an oversimplification of why this game is feeling so perfect for me. But that's about the crux of it.",5,7,0,381,1591,39,551,18,9,63,9.73,7.36,12.56
"If you are looking for a big budget game that is not like much else youve played and is not afraid to do totally wild things, then this is the game for you. Its heavy on simulation, but navigating the environment is very fun and the game looks gorgeous. I love it.",5,7,0,52,208,4,70,3,7,75.36,7.05,6.01,10.01
"The gameplay is oddly compelling in that it is mainly focused on how you navigate the world to deliver packages throughout the world. Rather than simply going from point A to point B, you also need to manage a variety of systems: health and stamina, materials for crafting and using supplies and tools, player's balance, item and equipment degradation, etc. Traveling in New areas can be daunting and stressful at times, but it's usually a cathartic feeling to finally reach your destination. Furthermore after exploring a new area and connecting it with the network, you unlock a type of shared world social feature where you can find and make use of supplies and tools that were left by other players in their game. For myself, it's the first online feature since Journey that makes an otherwise single player game feel like a collaborative experience that you share with others. There are also elements of combat and stealth throughout. While they may seem simplistic in their respective ways at first, each have systems that are never directly taught to the player, but when discovered through experimentation add a new layer of depth and strategy (i.e. the ability to throw packages at human enemies during combat). That said, the game itself is not difficult, especially for those who play games regularly. Side note - at the time of writing this, I have played the game for about 10 hours. Though I have yet to see how the story plays out, I can say that so far it is intriguing and the early hours do a fair job of setting the tone and themes of the narrative, and make the otherwise complicated lore of the world relatively easy to follow and digest. Graphics are stellar in presentation, and the the sound design matches closely in its quality. This may not be a game for you if you're wanting or expecting an action packed adventure. But if you don't mind something more experimental, then I would say go in with an open mind and you will find enough to appreciate in this game.",4,5,0,354,1600,47,534,15,12,55.26,11.41,9.52,14.75
"Ive been playing for a few hours now and have been enjoying the game so far. I have high expectations for the game because Ive been a huge Metal Gear Solid fan and can see some similarities in game design however the game play is very different. There is a lot of cutscenes that are very enjoyable and lots of walking in mountainous terrains. Im still undecided on how I feel about the game so far but I think Ill like it. This is a very unique game.",4,6,1,88,358,9,125,5,7,68.8,8.04,6.44,11.13
"Yes, you will walk hard, so hard. But never has walking felt so meaningful. Ive spent many hours walking across a lot of different video games, and for a variety of reasons. In a lot of those worlds, I just wanted to explore, and often with others. Maybe this particular game wasnt what I had in mind, but its ultimately a culmination of many aspects I love and wanted in a game. While I do agree that the whole package comes off very shallow at first - a visual feast of a story that drops the player into a delivery simulator - it unfolds into a curious and strange experience. The lonely walking is contextualized with a simple motivation, and an incredibly emotional story - then grown into an arc of meetings between other players through building and connecting across the world. Like ghosts in your isolated world, real people are an entity that can truly be felt. A constant symbiotic weave. Which is countered by the in-game threat of BTs (ghost-like entities that occupy that world), encounters that can be tense and sometimes terrifying, and always a threat to the mission at hand. Mobility throughout the world is aided by quite a few tools, including vehicles, robots and mechanical limbs. Eventually making certain traversing rather simple and relaxing, which means a lot in the face of trekking some harsh terrain on foot. The walking itself is akin to a survival simulator more than a delivery device. Knowing about certain packages can help the story, but in all reality its the challenge of the environment that provides the risk/reward satisfaction of playing the game, making deliveries - as well as the delicate balance of inventory too. The venture comes with a lot of characters that provide a deep story - one of the best Ive ever experienced. The entire experience truly comes full circle. Story and gameplay, the experience of playing through all the scenarios, traversing across such a vast environment - while many may not find this game suitable for everyone, I truly find it worthy of at least attempting the experience.",5,4,0,350,1652,54,566,17,12,49.13,11.52,10.52,14.41

"So far, I've only devoted a few hours to it and I can already tell that Death Stranding is something unlike anything I've ever seen before in a video game, and it's certainly one that has to be experienced 1st hand. Now I've played many a Hideo Kojima title and would definitely consider myself a fan of his work, the Metal Gear Solid series is one of my most favorite game franchises, but Death Stranding certainly takes the cake as one of his weirder endeavors. Lengthy, beautiful, enigmatic cutscenes and story telling aside, the actual gameplay has the main protagonist, Sam, acting as a courier for Bridges, a company whose primary M.O. focuses on reconnecting the people of the United Cities of America to ensure humanity's survival. There's a small bit of combat sprinkled throughout game, but the main draw seems to be the micromanagement of Sam's delivery inventory, and traversing across some truly gorgeous vistas, trying your best to keep said delivery in tact. The better condition your order is in when delivered, the more likes Sam receives upon completion, which, in turn, helps him to level faster and become more efficient. It all sounds nuts trying to explain on paper, but there is something very alluring and satisfying about how it all works, and I really do enjoy it the more I play. I only took off a star because this game definitely won't appeal to everyone since it is so different, but the presentation, the quality, the soundtrack, and the mystique of the story, in my opinion, is worth the price of admission, especially if you're a fan of Kojima's work.",4,3,0,285,1266,49,453,9,16,40.22,15.52,9.38,19.54
"Death Stranding is a 'two trips is for wimps' simulator, essentially. The entirety of the game-play relies on you carrying things and not falling on your face. Your triggers are literally your hands, and you use your hands to balance yourself. As if that wasn't enticing enough, the cryptic story hasn't explained nearly anything in the first Star Wars-trilogy-worth of time, and from what I have read on other reviews, isn't going to in a Star Wars-nonology-worth of time. This game brought me nothing but confusion and frustration, and is a massive disappointment for me seeing as I was very excited for it and LOVED all the trailers. I truly thought we were going to get something unique and original, which we did... If only it was also good. In any way.

I've spent about 2 hours watching cinematic scenes, 3 hours walking with packages on my back, 30 minutes trying to figure what this baby in a bladder is for and 30 min trying to figure out controls. I mean aside from the beautiful scenery (which gets old real fast), I can't believe they would hype this game up like this. It's walking. Just.... Walking. I mean you can run too, but really?? So disapppinted. Hopefully I can get some money back for this selling it used.",1,2,0,103,424,7,145,9,4,76.12,5.48,5.82,7.3
"This isn't a game that requires fast reaction, rather, it requires patience. Most of the gameplay is walking around as you work to deliver goods to people. Yes, it is a delivery man simulator but it's much more than that. The story is key in games like these and I have to say the pacing is good and if you're into sci-fi, this will be right up at your alley. It's so different than any other game I've played. It's refreshing, it's innovative, and you can tell a lot of passion went into producing this game. Give it a try. It's a bit slow in the beginning but picks up after you finish the introductory missions that teaches you the mechanics. Lastly, I find the game to be relaxing and stress relieving. I like games like Apex Legends too but those games can be stressful too. Thanks for reading my review. Have fun gaming!",5,2,0,163,645,14,223,12,4,77.31,5.85,5.29,8.87
"I really wanted to like this game. It has a great cast and the graphics are well done but the story is thin and the game play is extremely boring. You pretty much just run back and forth on the map and at every junction there is a giant cut scene, which would be great with this cast, if the story wasn't so bad. I am returning asap to see if I can recoup some of the 60$ I threw away on it. So disappointing.",1,3,1,86,316,5,109,5,5,82.15,6.07,4.08,9.21
"I picked this game up the day it came out, after months of anticipation. My friends have all asked me what the game is about, or to summarize the game for them. And honestly, it's hard to put in to words. You play as Sam, who is for-all-intents-and-purposes, a deliveryman. The game is set in a post-Apocalyptic America. You must deliver packages, and are tasked with keeping America connected by linking posts you encounter along the way. You face challenges from the terrain (which gets harder to traverse with the more packages Sam is carrying), BTs (who are supernatural beings that can attack you unless you stay quiet), and other monsters found littered across the vast lands. You essentially have to make it from D.C. to the West Coast on foot, or motorcycle, or any other vehicle you can find, salvage, and repair. Of course, you aren't completely alone. You have a robotic arm called a Odradek, which scans the terrain's topography, and sense's BTs and other evil lurking around. You also have a BB Pod which is a baby in a clear pod, that you connect to, in order to keep it alive. While Sam can sense when BTs are present, BB allows you to see them. With Hideo Kojima at the helm, you are getting a beautiful masterpiece that is part game, part cinematic experience with a star-studded cast with Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead fame), Guillermo del Toro among others. The game is said to be a slow lull in the early hours of the game, with it picking up as you progress in both skills and chapters. If you're playing on PlayStation Pro and a 4K TV with HDR, you are in for a real treat.",5,2,0,302,1251,30,430,17,7,68.35,8.14,6.89,11.08

I will admit it is a huge departure from the normal games on the market. And THAT is cool. I like different. But basically it is a game about delivering packages..... Not sure there is more to day. I know a lot of people like the game. And my comment above is a huge generalization. But it is true and I found it extremely boring and mundane.

"I am roughly 8 hours into this game and have enjoyed every second of it. There are many people out there saying this game is boring and I would say that I 100% disagree. Although these individuals are entitled to their opinion, the open world and mission possibilities are endless if you take a few minutes to truly understand the game, and I feel as if those reviewers did not give the game proper attention. There are subtle bits of humor scattered throughout the game that keep it very entertaining and the stunning visuals ensure that you are never in a dull or lifeless looking environment. For those craving action, much like the Metal Gear franchise, there are not only countless opportunities with the various enemies throughout the open world, but missions are completed based entirely on your own schedule and route. The online aspect is awesome where players have the opportunity to help others out by leaving ladders, bridges, and climbing hooks around, along with the occasional warning sign. In the spirit of avoiding any spoilers, I will simply say that in this game, it is very much worth getting past some of the slower moments because there is always something new and exciting waiting just around the corner. Death Stranding is something entirely new and is sure to revolutionize the genre. Much like Red Dead Redemption 2, investing a little more time than the average Call of Duty game will provide huge rewards and will present one of the most photo real and detail oriented experiences currently available on console.",5,1,0,262,1258,29,410,9,16,44.9,14.23,11.42,16.07

Intriguing back stories, mysterious happenings with far flung story lines. This is similar to a stream of consciousness story. The individual elements may be difficult to understand, or unbelievable, as they present themselves, but, if you push forward, they make some meaningful connections in the end. Like Nier: Automata, DS has some philosophical, and multiplayer networking threads throughout. Like Horizon Zero Dawn, it has a lot of reading materials giving further explanation as to what has been, and what is happening now. The oft mentioned travel/delivery times prove to be a sort of subtle puzzle - how to get from A to B, quickly, economically, and alive. It has a lot of resource collection, but not a grind, tools and weapons creation, and a fantastic soundtrack...tunes that accompany you on your walks across the land.

Most of the time you are the only living thing roaming around this empty world, made me feel even more lonely playing this junk. That about summarizes the whole game. Totally boring and waste of time and money. I can't believe so many people are giving this 'home made' video game a 5 stars. I guess anything goes these days as long as it makes it to release. Yes, it is from Kojima. Yes, the 4K graphics and story cutscenes are great, but still this experimental genre of a game is absolutely no fun. Very bland and repetitive. Playing this game is like going to your job in real life and working, running errands all day for measly wages. I don't write many reviews, only games that are either really good or really bad. Unfortunately, this game is not worth paying $60 for. Rent it first, if you have the urge, but I don't think it's even worth that.",1,10,10,232,986,19,332,16,6,71.05,6.95,7.15,9.08

"This is the third time I've bought this game... I'm going to talk about some improvements I've noticed when playing this version. Loading times feel a bit faster than the Wii U version. Graphics are more colorful, closer to the 3DS version than the Wii U version. It feels like the Switch is able to handle more enemies on screen than the Wii U version and with a higher frame rate to boot, heck even the menus have a higher frame rate. All the content from the 3DS version is now back and in HD. When playing the Adventure mode, missions feel more balanced in difficulty to start off. On top of that, previous DLC such as characters and costumes and more, are now added rewards for completing certain missions on these Adventure maps. But he biggest thing added to this mode is the ability to buy item cards with rupees. Rather than waste time replaying a mission to get one item, you can just buy it and be done as long as you've unlocked the item before (I'm pretty sure this wasn't in either version before). There's just two or three downsides to this version compared to my Wii U experience. Just like on 3DS, there are more materials to find meaning more materials to grind for to upgrade characters where on Wii U there were less materials and it was easier to upgrade more characters. Another thing is amiibo don't seem to give higher ranking items until you've unlocked the higher ranked version in game. I recall on Wii U being able to get higher level items with amiibo easier. Also the Link amiibo isn't used to unlock the Spinner weapon anymore, which is good as it's an in-game unlock now, but the Young Link amiibo doesn't get you items for Young Link in-game, it gets you stuff for regular Link. In fact it doesn't seem like the other Zelda related amiibo, like the Guardian or Bokoblin, got any special functions and they just act as regular amiibo; would of been nice if this gave rare materials more often or something. And finally... THERE'S STILL NO PLAYABLE GROOSE! TL;DR Looks better, plays better, includes all previous content and plenty of quality of life improvements all around with barely any negatives.",5,2,0,399,1695,40,574,19,10,63.81,9.58,7.77,12.41
"I originally played the earlier 3DS version of this game. I greatly enjoyed my time then, but I wished I had the co-op experience that the original Wii U release had (I did not have a Wii U when I played the 3DS version). When this game was released for the Switch as a Definitive Edition, I knew it would be fun to revisit this Zelda spin-off game. The gameplay is fun and it will take a long time to fully exhaust the depth of this game. I highly recommend it for those who like being able to plow through their enemies and then tackle the tougher bosses.",5,2,0,110,439,10,150,5,9,69.14,9.08,6.32,12.44
"I never got a chance to buy the Wii-U and I understand that this is a port over with some minor adjustments to the Games graphics and color scheme but man is this game FUN!!!!! I am enjoying all these Port Overs and hope Nintendo keeps bringing them on to the switch. I feel like the Wii-U system was supposed to be what the Switch is today. If you don't own this on a Wii-U system or don't have a Wii-U system but own a switch, buy this game. It's worth it, it's fun and you can play with an additional person Locally like inside your home with out needing a second switch and additional game cartridge like you need with splatoon 2.",5,2,0,131,493,7,165,5,10,73.68,9.49,5.2,12.62
"I put over 200 hours into this game for WiiU, and I was excited to play the additions in the 3DS version but it was so choppy it was hardly playable at times. Now, we get both packages combined at 1080p 60fps on the Switch? YES PLEASE! Dynasty Warrior games are fun but the characters always kinda blended together for me. (Same with Fire Emblem Warriors) However, Zelda plays nothing like Midna who plays nothing like Fi, and so on and so forth. And all of their movesets are related to their characters in their respective games. If anyone tells you this is a button mashing game, they really haven't played enough. It's part strategy part fighting game. Knowing when to move on, when to hold back, when to fight, and when to run is all an important part of many of the harder missions. The story mode is basic and just 'okay' and reasonably long but not too much. Where this game shines is the challenge maps called 'Adventure Mode.' This mode forces you to play the other characters sometimes and you may end up loving a character once you get a taste like me with Zant. I highly recommend this game for anyone who hasn't played the originals.",5,2,0,213,908,24,298,13,7,71.84,7.31,7.46,11.06
"Hyrule warriors DE takes the beauty of the wii u version and all the extras on the 3ds version with all the dlc and mushes them all for a game that was already considered a great musuo game into one of the best. The cast overall shine as everyone is vastly different in playstyle Bosses offer methods to defeat them that is not go in head first. Wide arange landscapes that doesn't feel to repetatve or copy paste. And thats just the main story. We haven't even touch the side quest missions, maps, fairy system and all other extras. If you have never played a musuo game before, this is the perfect entry point since its tailored to begginer friendly and simplified, but still offers methods that veteran players will enjoy.",5,1,0,133,583,15,195,6,11,60.3,10.36,8.64,13.38
"As someone who was a big Zelda fan but not really into Dynasty Warriors, I was kind of skeptical of Hyrule Warriors for a while. A bit later, I tried someone else's copy of Fire Emblem Warriors for the Switch, and while I could see the potential in the style of gameplay, it was not enough to convince me to buy it. When a Switch port of Hyrule Warriors was announced, I decided to give it another shot, and the way it appealed to the Zelda fan in me was enough to convince me to go for it. Gameplay-wise, it is still Dynasty Warriors, but Hyrule Warriors tries hard to weave Zelda gameplay, items, lore, and other references in wherever it can. It will certainly not feel exactly like a Zelda game, but if you already kind of enjoy the Dynasty Warriors but are into Zelda, the Zelda content could be enough to make you enjoy the game as much as I do. Performance-wise, the game runs great while you are playing it (though, in some cases, at the cost of graphical fidelity). Oddly, frame rate stutters occur mostly during cutscenesnothing new, if you played the Wii U version, but so far it looks like none of the stutters from the Wii U version have been fixed. Even so, those are fairly infrequent, and as I said, I have not experienced any lag issues during normal gameplay. In terms of the amount of content, I have no complaints. As the Definitive Edition title suggests, this game includes all the content from both the Wii U and 3DS versions of Hyrule Warriors and a bit more, including the main story, the original game's cast of great characters from across all the best Zelda games, extra characters from the 3DS version such as Linkle, an additional mode that lets you play levels inspired by the original Legend Of Zelda world map, and new skins for Link and Zelda based on The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. All in all, even if the gameplay is still very Dynasty Warriors, they went all-out to make this feel like part of the Zelda universe.",4,1,0,366,1550,48,539,11,16,48.47,14.76,8.21,18.55

"The previous reviews on this product were in relation to the bundle with the PSVR and did not address the game itself. I thoroughly used to enjoy Doom in the 90s and was hoping for a great revival. The game looks amazing and, so far, I have enjoyed the storyline. However, the game does not utilize fluid movement but more like the click and move movement in old PC games like Myst. It jumps, what appears, five steps upon every standard movement and can be disorienting during the combat scenes. Other than that, the game looks amazing and I look forward to finishing it soon. I would recommend this to a friend if the movement was not an issue for them.",3,2,0,121,522,12,170,7,8,70.43,7.73,7.85,10.88

But that's not 100% true, there's a smooth movement option, and if you're playing with a Move Controller (or better yet, the PS VR Aim controller), this is a pretty unique experience. I wouldn't recommend playing this if all you have is a regular PS4 controller. DOOM 2016 is already 60fps and plays great: this won't really offer you anything better.",5,1,0,94,394,12,135,5,8,66.25,8.69,7.27,12.63

However, the Aladdin side of this game is not the original Nintendo version, but rather the SEGA which I never played having an SNES system and not a SEGA. Nowhere on the box is the version listed. I was fairly disappointed and attempted to return the game which isn't permitted in Best Buy stores once a game has been opened. No one informed me of this policy and it is not written anywhere in the store. I would not have purchased this product if I had known that the NINTENDO version was not included. The only reason I give this a Fair 2/5 star rating is because The Lion King side of the game did include the Nintendo version.",2,0,1,151,627,15,213,8,8,68.34,8.42,7.05,11.52

"The main reason I bought Lego Avengers was because it was being advertised as an open world Lego game and my son loves Legos and the Avengers. However, the advertising is misleading and requires you to go through several levels to unlock a playable open world hub. Rinse and repeat until you finish the game and then it truly can be semi-open world. So I decided to run through the campaign as quickly as possible to unlock the free roam mode, however the game mechanics are so terrible that I really can't stand playing this. You go from literally mashing the same button or two over and over again, to trying to figure out these stupidly obscure puzzles. This wouldn't be so bad save for the fact that there are dozens of prompts and highlighted areas that draw the player in but require a different character to actually be able to break the brick, control the scanner, etc. And lastly, I have experienced glitches where a character is stuck in a corner and cannot jump or move out which required me to close the game and restart the entire mission. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because my kid does like to run around as a super hero. But I really wish I would have saved the money and passed on it.",2,1,0,227,967,22,329,9,12,58.62,11.35,8.07,13.97

"This Lego game did not win me over. Without going too much in depth on this review, I'll just make a few short points. First: The game is a slightly lengthened play by play of the the most recent Marvel movies. With a few extra missions tossed in here and there. Second: I honestly think that these Lego games have gotten increasingly more complex, especially for a child. The basics will always be the same but with more and more to do in each iteration and annoying 'help' icons, this game almost makes it a drag to play. Third: Lastly, I'm tired of all of the console exclusive content. Mainly towards PlayStation. I have all three current gen systems so, losing content isn't a problem. This is just an annoyance, timed exclusive or not, this needs to stop. Of course, if you want more content get it on PlayStation. I'd rather have it on Xbox if it weren't for that.",3,0,1,165,682,11,223,12,5,78.54,5.72,6.35,8.17

Really tiring of the Fox/MCU ownership rights..wish we could return to the 90s :( (No PS4 Marvel vs Capcom, X-Men arcade removed from PS Network).

I was shocked by how quick the loading times were and how well the controls worked out (there is a learning curve like most games however.) Thus far, my time spent playing has all been in handheld mode, and I havent had any issues regarding the games performance as of writing this review.

That it was a sleeper hit basically. Boy were they right. This game feels like a video game, but in the best way possible. Lot of replayability and it's a blast! You can switch between different classes, and even hybrid classes. You also have a companion that follows you everywhere and helps you out. You can recruit two more 'pawns' but those are intechangeable - don't get attached. You'll need to get new ones as you level up.

But after an early update, the game runs beautifully and with the release of more content (all free), BFV will rank as the best of all time. Why will it be the best? Let me tell you quickly. 1. The gameplay has been refined with better controls/graphics. 2. Sound quality is realistic and guns/vehicles roar to life. 3. Plenty of customizing to soldiers/weapons/vehicles. 4.

"Excellent punishing gameplay for souls-like players. Drop the NPCs if you dont want them helping. Everyone comments on the character customization being so unique and vast, but thats only a small part of what makes this game good.

"I'm really disappointed in this game. They took out a lot of the great things about Fallout (interesting story , NPCS) . It is now multiplayer, which is good, but the glitches bugs and flaws make this review negative. It's more of a survival game than traditional fallout RPG game. Need to eat drink sleep, weapons break down etc. Spend a lot of time doing mundane things instead of just exploring. It is also only ONLINE play so cant pause, have multiple saves, etc. No moral decisions to make. Everyone is dead, so all 'missions' feel unimportant as the quest giver is already dead. I suggest watching online for awhile. If you get bored watching you will be bored playing.",2,17,1,120,532,14,174,11,5,73.09,5.77,7.55,9.03
"Player beware. I am at level 30 now and the last 2 days have been back breakers. 1. I lost my home base! It was gone off the map. Turns out my Stash was intact as was my CAMP, but my fort with my building and all of my crafting stations, turrets, furniture, crops, etc.- All gone!! I read online that if a player builds their base in the same location of yours, you will lose it all. I did. Took hours to rebuild. 2. Now I am stuck in my power armor and cannot exit! This is a common problem- read about it online. I have not had it resolved yet and hope I don't lose my character. There are recommended fixes online but those too take hours of time to screw around with. Bottom line, you can live with minor glitches/inconveniences but not glitches that can completely change your play through. This game is not ready for public consumption.",1,13,2,163,653,7,211,17,3,87.59,3.42,4.67,5.55
"Breaks my heart to write this as I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series with 4 being the best, this game is a disgrace. There are so many glitches it's literally unplayable for me. I've been playing 4 hours today and the game has frozen up and kicked me out 9 times today alone. If the game freezes up before I am able to reach my last death to retrieve my loot, I lose all of my Junk which is critical for repairs and upgrades, which you'll spend half the game constantly fixing your weapons and armor and trying to figure out how to carry and stash stuff. Massive battles, which in a game like Assassin's Creed Odyssey are amazing, are absolutely impossible. The game lags so bad when there are more than 5-6 enemies attacking to the point you can't play it, then it just freezes up and quits. My internet speed is a hard-line fiber connection with over 700 Mbps and none of my other games or devices have issues so it has nothing to do with the internet connection dropping out. I thought after playing the beta they would resolve the glitches but no they have managed to get even worse. Numerous missions have issues that you'll need to replay several times, it took me 24 hours and several hard reboots just to get a holotape to load on a computer on a Main Quest 'One of Us' before it finally worked, but I wasted a whole day and couldn't progress in the game until it finally worked. Also, in past Fallout games you could re-load a previously saved game if you wanted to make a different choice - not on 76! Your only option is to continue playing or start over from scratch Level 1. Save your money and get AC Odyssey or Red Dead 2! Trust me if you buy this game you will regret it! If I could give it a ZERO I would!",1,12,3,341,1356,28,461,14,10,67.74,9.86,6.37,13.03
"This isnt your typical fallout game so please do your research before deciding to buy. Watch gameplay on YouTube and read up on what the game is like.

"Buyer Beware! I am a longtime Fallout fan and purchased the game to play in single player mode. Once I got the game home and waited the 2 days for the update to download, I was very disappointed to find out I couldn't start the game without XBox Live. I refuse to get XBox live because the internet here in Alaska is terrible, so I guess my days of being a Fallout fan are over. It would be nice if they would have put on the box that XBox Live was required for single player mode. It would have saved me a lot of time and frustration. I hope BestBuy will give me my money back.",1,6,0,117,453,6,150,7,6,81.41,6.06,5.2,8.74
"This game needs ALOT of work... I had unfortunately pre-ordered this game and paid the full $59,99 for [in my opinion] an unfinished game that dropped it's price only a week after release. I wish I wouldn't have spent the full amount on this, but for $35, it's a fair price. It's not a bad game, but I definitely was expecting better from another Fallout game. Some improvements/changes I would like to see: I'm not a fan of the No-Human NPC thing. PLEASE introduce them back with the next DLC. From what I understood at E3, Bethesda's reasoning behind having no human NPC's was that 'you are the first humans to emerge from the vault, there's no survivors because they didn't survive the bombs' but after you start playing, you see the map is littered with bodies of 'survivors' who have left notes and holotapes about their lives AFTER the bombs dropped... These would have been interesting NPC's' to meet and do missions for, instead of the hand written notes and holotapes we are left with.. It seems like the story writers were extremely rushed, short staffed, and working on a Ramen Noodle budget. The game feels unfinished, lazy, and pretty much emotionless. It feels like the campaign is just a suggestion if anything, I get more enjoyment out of just exploring the map than I do actually following the missions/campaign. Huge issue with high level players ganging up against lower level players...Hard to progress in the game when you're a low-level and being tracked down by players more than twice as powerful as you - forcing you to leave the server to find a new one after they've already taken all the aluminum scraps you just spent the last hour trying to collect... :P You can't really be mad at them though, it's understandable to have gotten bored in the game after you've reached a certain level... But still, either make an option to turn on/off player damage, or ALLOW PRIVATE SERVERS. Also, if SONY was the only one against allowing cross-platform; why can't XBOX and PC players play together? Me and my fiance are huge Fallout fans and even though I've got a perfectly capable PC that could run this game, the only way it looks like we are going to be able to play together is if we either buy a second Xbox (and a second copy of the game because we have the physical copy) or I spend another $1000+ on another gaming computer for her to play on - either way, it's not worth it.. :/ In conclusion, I feel like the artists and developers did a great job at making this a beautiful and interactive game. There are alot of bugs and glitches that I'm sure will be fixed within the next few months. Not taking stars off for that, every game as big as this is expected to have it's quirks. I'm rating 3 stars because the story line is so disappointing and the lack of NPC's makes the game feel dull/empty...",3,8,3,538,2210,47,748,21,11,63.21,10.81,7.2,13.74
"The concept of an always online, multiplayer/none single player campaign/story, NPC-less, Fallout game is already a sketchy proposition... after playing 76 for a couple dozen hours, I can see the appeal that this spin-off of the franchise might have for some who enjoy the basic aspects of open world survival RPGs; like leveling up, and searching for/fetching materials and resources to build, break down and consume- rinse & repeat... unfortunately, even that type of experience is hampered by an incredible amount of bugs & glitches (just search youtube for examples), that are surprising even for a Bethesda game.... if Bethesda can patch the bugs, balance out the gameplay, expand build limit, and listen to the various other critiques & requests on the forums, then Fallout 76 could be a 7/10 for a niche audience.... But right now, it's a broken mess, and there are no signs that Bethesda has any serious strategy to address the situation. For now, skip this one, keep an eye on the forums, and if the situation improves, maybe pick it up on sale.",1,4,1,182,829,26,284,6,16,44.03,14.65,10.01,17.85
"Trying to play this game was so awful I had to write a review to warn people not to waste money buying this game. I loved Fallout 4 and was very excited to get Fallout 76 and get started. I was shocked to find out it is online only but liked Fallout 4 so much I figured I would give it a try. So I started playing the game and managed to build a C.A.M.P. but then the server disconnected. I figured it was because it is a new game so maybe they needed time to work out the kinks and release a patch or something technical....I asked my friends if it happened to them and they said yes. I waited a few weeks and tried to play again with no luck, every 5 minutes the server drops out and you forced to reload the game. I spent more time waiting for it to load than actually playing the game. I don't have problems playing any other online game, just Fallout 76. If you get dropped off a server even once then the game is trash compared to regular offline games because you never get kicked off your gaming system and have to wonder if you can even play the $60 video game cause the sever is down repeatedly or if the sever is getting an upgrade.... Fallout 76 came out in November and still there is no fix to the problem, I pay for fast internet so I don't have problems gaming but it's not the internet. This game sucks, don't waste your money.",1,2,0,273,1049,14,359,16,6,78.27,6.58,5.06,8.88
"As a fan of the Fallout series, I had really high hopes for this one. The map is huge, which is great, but... Unlike other Fallout games, there's no NPC's to interact with, which makes the missions and discovering new towns a little empty. Yes, you can play with other players (when it works), but I've found that can also be a little distracting since you have to listen to a lot of recordings. Also, everybody's not necessarily on the same page as far as where they are in the game, which can make things a little confusing to get done. The multiplayer also glitches out quite a bit, things lag and lock-up. I've also had a lot of trouble adding people to or joining teams. To fix it, we've had to all either reboot the game or reset the console, which can be frustrating. The one good thing about multiplayer is that you've got others to help scavenge and beat creatures you may come across. I'm interested to see what Bethesda will do to repair many of the well documented issues with the game as well as the added content. We'll see how this goes, but so far, unless you're a diehard fan and want to ride it out with Bethesda, I'd go in cautiously at this point. Maybe (hopefully), they'll fix the issues and this will become a great game. All that being said, be warned, if you're a fan of the Fallout series and gameplay, this is a lot different.",3,2,0,267,1049,19,358,13,8,72.55,8.24,5.86,11.06
"A lot of gripes with this game. I played it even with all the negativity and actually enjoyed it. There is so much wrong with this game and so little that went right. It only holds its ground because it is FALLOUT, and only because its fallout. Playing with friends is fun, but once you reach level 50 there is very little to do. Glitched loading screens, enemies, cards, stashes, quests, events, mods, everything is buggy. The end game content is a reskinned dragon from Skyrim. They LOWERED xp given by high level monsters with recent patch, thus increasing the boring grind that the game already had. Good weapons and armor are EXTREMELY rare, like 50 hours in and I cant get one rare. Same with X01 mods. I've server hopped 100+ times and still havent got the ones I want. Whats the point? There is no point to this game. Mindless, glitchy, boring, carnage. DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED WITH CANVAS BAGS, MICRO TRANSACTIONS...

"I don't know what Bethesda is thinking but why in the world would you have this be online only? It requires you to have Xbox live to play. That sucks. Not everyone can sit at home and play. I bought this to take on overseas deployments and there is not internet everywhere else in the world. So I really just wasted my money getting it. Plus you have to have Xbox Live to play it. Anyone who ever tried to cancel an Xbox live membership knows that it takes an act of God, Congress and a letter from the Pope to do so. So I will never get Xbox live just to play this. I am done with this series. Didn't Bethesda see what happen to Diablo when they had an online only game?",1,2,0,136,524,10,174,11,3,86.05,4.33,4.46,7.89
"I LOVE me some fallout. Ive played most of them. This atrocity, however, is an insult to the not only the gamer that wastes their money on it, but all of the fallout games that came before it! Its extremely glitchy, there is no plot or story, they pretend that there is, but no, there isnt, and the gameplay is boring and awful. You cannot pause the game at all, its constantly online even if you want to play solo. You will also continue to be hit by enemies even when going into your pipboy to switch weapons or use aids. What kind of crap is that?! Everything about it is POOP! Just dont do it. If you really want to try the game, I would at least wait a few months to see if they fix or improve it.

"I am a huge fallout fan but this game is simply offensive. This is basically a Fallout themed Destiny knockoff. I thought Destiny had a terrible story until I played this game. It has virtually no story, you rarely run into other players, half of the missions I played were so buggy I couldn't even complete the objectives. Framerate would drop to single digits at certain points. I had the game less than 48 hours before I traded it in.

"Here since Fallout 3 and this one doesn't disappoint. All the negativity it's gotten, while deserved, one needs to remember, this is their FIRST shot at an online/multiplayer game. Now that the dust has settled, I feel like it's a great time to jump into this world, if you haven't given it a chance yet. Also, the addition of human NPCs will be VERY welcome, since talking to terminals/robots is only engaging for so long. Adventuring: If you like exploration games which allow you to go (literally) where ever you want as soon as you leave the startup mission, then you'll love the freedom this game offers. It's truly a 'do what ever you want, whenever you want' kind of experience. You'll want to follow the main quest-line to follow the lore that is Appalachia, and to get specific key recipes or tips to help you out, especially early on. From delving into random caves/mines to assaulting a bandit camp or just picking a direction and walking to see what quest pops up, there is ALWAYS something to do to keep you busy. Crafting: Probably my favorite, next to adventuring, is the crafting aspect in a game. Again, this game delivers in a massive way. Finding recipes/plans through adventuring or via quest/event rewards, to create new useful items is a huge part of the experience. The storage limit is still an issue, but you just learn to adapt to what you really need, versus what you are holding onto 'just-in-case'. PvP: Multiplayer (specifically pvp) was never my cup of tea and this really worried me about FO76. There are 3 modes now and each is very different, regarding solo vs. pvp gameplay. Adventure is for ppl like me, solo focused, but can team up if you/they want. If someone does attack you (this has only happened twice since I started playing last year) the damage done is next to nothing, unless you attack back. It's much more common to see ppl helping each other out in this mode, as opposed to hunting each other. Survival is a pvp focused world where the rewards are better, and expeiemce gain is increased, but you constantly have to be on your toes and look over your shoulder. Nuclear Winter is a battle royale game mode... because I guess that's a thing now in most games. But, to each their own. Wrap-up: This is the tip of the iceberg, so to truly know for yourself, I'd give it a try, especially if you enjoyed FO4. It's a giant world to explore and you'll be glad you gave it a chance! Also, it's worth noting, you need to have Xbox Live Gold to play this game. No monthly subscription, however, besides that.",5,3,2,480,1994,43,678,26,8,68.6,8.28,7.02,10.97

I am a long-time fan of Fallout but this iteration is a complete failure. If you are looking for a fun game to play this isn't it. The lack of NPC's might have decreased costs for Bethesda but it also decreased my potential enjoyment. I had hoped Magnolia would make a repeat appearance and that cleverly written story lines would make me care about new characters the way I cared about Piper and Curie.

Also, there are no computer generated 'human' characters to interact with during quests. Building mode is different. I could go on but since I don't have that much time in the game yet, I'll end it here.

Until then, I will continue to build my camp and enjoy this game as long as the server will let me before booting me off. If you don't want to follow a storyline and just want to do random quests, stockpile random items, build a house to show off, trade with other online players.

The animations are the same... same weapons... same power armor animations... same sound effects. Aside from more vegetation I would swear this was Fallout 4. All this the game is worth it at sales price to add to your collection!!!",3,1,0,97,394,9,134,11,3,81.01,4.15,4.73,7.24
"Finally learned my lesson on pre-ordering games. I could hardly get into the game itself because even on the One X the performance is terrible.

"This has been a unique spin on the Fallout series. I personally would have preferred the game to be solo player instead of open world. It has it's weird glitches, enemy respawns as soon as you clear out a building and other odd things that don't make it as satisfying as it was being single player. It still has the look and feel of Fallout and is still time consuming and enjoyable to play.",5,1,0,76,311,5,104,4,8,71.78,7.97,6.7,10.23
"I was extremely excited to play FO76 but almost immediately upon leaving the vault, my excitement turned to disappointment.

"It is a fun online version of fallout to play with friends. The party system works great and servers only have minor trouble. That being said it lacks the depth and narration of single player fallout games. The lack of NPC's make the world feel empty and the quest two dimensional. I really enjoy exploring the wasteland with other people I just wish it had the level of storytelling I expect for Bethesda games.",3,1,0,75,333,6,110,5,7,67.53,7.57,8.33,9.2
"This is the most depressing expectation ever. I looked forward to the release of this game with giddiness.

"I could write an essay about all the negatives that plague this game and it would be more effort than they put into their game. The game can be summarized with a simple example. I spent hours attempting this obstacle course on the map hoping to find something cool at the end for all my effort. In the end there's nothing but a couple crafting materials you could get in 2 minutes, and a pathetic note. They expect you to grind and reward you with the feeling of regret and depression. Dont support this, and tell corporate that this will not be acceptable.",1,1,0,104,446,10,146,6,8,70.48,7.74,7.71,10.78
"I played this game during their Beta & not much has changed. While the graphics are impressive, there are still glitches & the biggest glaring flaw for the Fallout franchise: Tou can only play ONLINE. Although it is not essential to play with others, the game does urge you to do so with areas which seem overpowered. And while new patches are being introduced to fix problems, there is still a Wait & See option to see if the game will live up to the Fallout name.",4,1,0,84,368,4,114,4,10,70.71,8.61,8.55,10.3
"I told the Best Buy person that i do not like to play in line. I live fall out She recommended fallout 76. I buy it get it home and upload.

"I have enjoyed several previous Bethesda games on the xbox (Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, Skyrim) when I heard about Fallout 76 and moving into an online game I was excited. However I quickly realized as I played the game that it was pretty boring as a Single Player and the lack of NPCs almost make it feel lonely. Once I purchased another copy of the game for my wife and had a reliable partner to play the game with it become much more fun. I would not recommend this game if you are use to playing Fallout games solo and were planning on playing this solo as well. Outside of that the game itself has run ok on my Xbox though it does seem like it looks worse than Fallout 4 and every now and again things just disappear and reappear at random it seems. Of course I have play other Bethesda games and while it is always disappointing to see in a game it is not exactly a surprise.",2,2,1,171,703,14,237,6,13,60.65,11.88,7.33,14.67
"For a Fallout game, this one is just sad. It was broken from the start. The game is super glitchy, your c.a.m.p. will just disappear and you cant rebuild without breaking it up and starting over, the levels of the creatures are unbalanced, you can go to a spot as a low 10 level person and encounter a creature thats 10 then you can come back to the same spot and it will be level 40 and wipe the floor with you.

"I will admit, I was one of the ones who got uneasy by the idea of an online-only Fallout. Originally I had no plans to buy it, but by the time BETA came around, I saw enough to make me want to give it a chance. The Good: You can play it solo. No, there is no solo mode, but if you want to go it alone you can. I'm not much of a multiplayer person, so I spend the majority of my time completing my quests alone. If I come across someone needing help I may lend a hand, finish off a few enemies to lighten their load or help them defend their workshop. Once that's done, I wave goodbye and go back to my own tasks. Occasionally I team up with my son and we play together, but even then we can each go our own ways at any time. The Bad: It is still very early times, and as mentioned by Bethesda themselves there are bugs. They have put one patch out already since launch and more to come. It does feel a bit odd without human NPCs, but it's getting a bit easier to handle. There is also the issue with small stash limits which they have said will be raised. Sometimes weapon wear and food/water needs can get annoying. Would I recommend it for solo players? Yes. Would I recommend for multiplayer? Yes. Is it for everyone? No. Check out gameplay videos online if you are still on the fence. The lore and storyline are still present, so don't worry about that.

"This is still a wonderful work by Bethesda, but you must enjoy with a different mindset. It doesn't feel like a typical Bethesda title because it is online. The interactions with other players is a change, but great. And it is awesome being able to join up and explore the wastelands with friends! But bear in mind that, with everyone else being actual players, I feel like the typical driving story isn't as effective in this version. The use of recorded logs to initiate quests doesn't make me feel as invested in any semblance of a storyline, which is greatly missed from this title. It is still a stellar game, you just need to approach with the mindset that it is not your typical Fallout title. Also, in-game bugs are pretty common, but with Bethesda's continued work on the title, there should really be only minimal interference when playing, if any.",4,1,4,156,685,21,234,8,10,60.14,9.72,8.5,13.18
"This game has gotten so much flak in the last few weeks, and this is pretty much not a game that is similar to the Fallouts before it. This game has little story, little interaction with the world, and feels more or less like a deserted Fallout 4. But the game isnt all about the world. The game is about what you make of it with your friends and strangers. The story comes from the path and progression you and your friends make as you explore the Appalachia. Fighting through hives of enemies to launch a nuke, and fighting the endgame boss with the other ~20 people on the server was the best experience Ive had in any Bethesda game. The community in this game is so much better than others, it is almost the exact opposite experience of GTA V online. There are technical issues, and performance across all platforms is not just right yet. But Bethesda is being very transparent and working with the community to better the game and make the experience more stable and bug free. I definitely recommend this game to anyone that wants to give it a try but has been dissuaded by the many negative reviews. Just understand that this is not a regular Fallout game, this is different.",4,6,12,216,947,26,313,11,10,64.31,9.17,8.47,12.67

"So Im no Fallout Fanboy but do enjoy playing the series. I started with Fallout4, great game, never finished like most, but still enjoyed it. When 76 was announced with online play I was super excited. So comparison to previous games, similar game play, you can just grind through all the missions and daily quests. Or just run around with friends looking for loot and grinding. No real story to go in order or to follow. Just a bunch of little flashbacks/memories or stories from the characters who were lost.

"1st, this game is not Fallout 4. Too many get this game expecting a flawless multiplayer rehash of 4, but it's an MMO and a totally different experience. There are limits to base size and how much loot you can hold because servers can only handle so many players and all their loot. Still, once you learn to manage yourself it's not such a big deal. Also, the SPECIAL and Perks system is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from any other Fallout to date. SPECIAL points affect how many perk cards you can equip not which ones will become available. It was made so you can respec your character on the fly while trying to maintain a balance at the same time. 2nd lots of bugs, but even MMOs like WOW and KOTR still have lag, latency and other issues periodically. It's an expected risk of any MMO and a Bethesda MMO at that. Haven't had any game breakers, just some minor annoyances like getting dropped from the server, lag, and having to revisit my base stash to refresh my materials for world use. It's only two weeks old and still not clean, but it's slowly getting there. Overall, not the greatest game, but far from a bad one too. Lots to explore and it really shines when you group with friends. I'd definitely recommend it, but check the youtube playthroughs and vids too make sure it's a game for you.",3,3,3,246,1023,21,341,14,7,71.73,7.62,6.97,10.44

"Collection of Mana is a physical cart containing the first three games in the Seiken Densetsu (Mana) series: Final Fantasy Adventure (Seiken Densetsu 1) - Originally released on the Gameboy and was an action RPG spinoff of the Final Fantasy series. So it has chocobos and even some sprite work from the old NES FF games. Was remade on the PlayStation Vita as Adventures of Mana. Secret of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 2) - Originally released on the Super Nintendo. Action RPG featuring a full three character party. Combat is a little clunky, but still holds up decently well. Was remade on the PlayStation 4 recently. Trials of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 3) - Originally released on the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo) in Japan and nowhere else. Still an action RPG featuring a three character party that you create from a pool of six characters and depending on who you pick will alter the story. Currently being remade on PS4 and Switch (though the remake loses the multiplayer functionality). This collection marks the first time Trials of Mana/Seiken Densetsu 3 has ever been officially released in the West, which if you're a longtime fan of the series, is a huge deal since it's one of the best ones. The price is a little high for what could be regarded as 3 very old games, but when you consider how much work had to go into localizing the third game into English, it's much easier to justify. I grew up playing this series and to be able re-experience it on the Switch is such a treat. A couple of the games even have multiplayer (Secret supports 3 players, while Trials supports 2).

"The music, the characters, the story, the gameplay, it is all here. Being the fifth game in the series, not including DmC which was a reboot, this brings back Nero, Dante, and a new character named V who are all playable. Each one comes with their own unique style and motivates the player to get better while increasing their rank mid-battle. The story is rather short which took me about 12 hours, but you will not unlock everything on your first playthrough. There is microtransanctions to give you a boost, but you do not need to as I have almost unlocked everything after two playthroughs. Other than the story, bloody palace is another mode where you go through 100 floors of enemies and bosses and really tests your skills.",5,1,0,130,584,12,183,6,11,65.75,9.47,9.25,12.36

The DMC reboot was good, but not up to my standard for a DMC. Devil May Cry 5 is much closer to the originals than I expected, and I have been very pleasantly surprised at everything it has to offer. Dante plays fantastic, and the other playable characters are fun as well. I especially like V, and his very unique combat style. It's also just Gorgeous in 4K!!!! Absolutely pick this up if you are, or have been, a fan of Devil May Cry. It's feels like the real deal this time. I also recommend the Deluxe Edition content that you can purchase from the PSN Store, especially if you enjoy the music from the originals. It allows you to set songs from those as the battle music for each separate character, which is extremely satisfying!",5,1,7,168,702,18,241,11,6,69.97,7.29,6.83,10.39
"I heard this game described in an online review as being like Lego Worlds, and I would have to agree. Rather than following a similar formula as used with other Lego games, this game has worlds you explore, collect bricks from breaking stuff, and build other stuff to progress. You collect artifacts while playing to help you complete some tasks. I guess that's about it. There are no mission levels like there are in other Lego games (or, if there are, I have not found them yet). Thus far I have played for several hours and have to say that I hate it. If I wanted to play Lego Worlds, I would have played Lego Worlds. Remembering which Lego thing to build in which area because I want to power something or jump higher is annoying and tedious. On more than one occasion, I would up building things accidentally because the selection menu is not very intuitive. In short, If you like to wander around aimlessly over quasi-vast worlds breaking everything you can find because you need special bricks to build obscure things that really do nothing to move the plot forward, then you may enjoy this game. If you like previous Lego games and think this will be more of the same, you would be mistaken.",2,1,0,219,957,19,306,11,10,68.42,8.66,8.41,11.43
"LEGO Worlds with the Movie textures. My son and I really loved the game for the first movie so we were excited for this, but its not the usual LEGO formula. Its basically the LEGO Worlds game wich is alright but gets really repetitive. Its very polished and runs well compared to Worlds, but not as much fun as the usual LEGO game format.",2,1,0,64,269,9,95,4,7,65.02,8.17,7.06,12.03
"Since the plot of this movie is the 'battle' between Lego and Duplo, then I have no problem calling this the Duplo of Lego games. If is pared down, stripped of all the enhancements that have made recent Lego games a challenge, and essentially one for the kids. The lower price point on launch day should tip you off to even the company's feelings on it's quality, and it shows. Seriously, if you are a fan of the Lego games, maybe don't skip it, but definitely wait for a price point of $15 or under.",2,1,0,98,389,6,133,4,10,67.15,9.98,6.33,12.25

"A great game. I played along side my son while we searched the game for new ways to build new Lego worlds. Here's the thing though, this game would be so much more fun if it had multiplayer. I understand the difficulties involved but, gaming is just better with your friends. My son was pretty bummed out because only 1 friend had the game to even play with him at all. Without that multiplayer element, he essentially was just playing by himself. In the end, it's a game he comes back to often but just doesn't play a lot. Hopefully this will change as it truly is a great game!",3,1,0,113,455,7,147,8,5,82.44,5.27,5.78,8.13
"Some of the missions can be repetitive, but the kids like the game. There are multiple bugs with the game such as freezing and locking up. Those issues could be overlooked, but the biggest issue so far is with the saved data. After completing the game to the point where they could create their own worlds, two worlds were created and then the game froze and had to be restarted. When restarting, an error message was given stating that saved data could not be created. At this point the game restarted at the first world and the ship to visit other worlds could not be accessed. So far i cannot find any solution online other than restarting the game from the beginning (losing all progress). From what i read online, the company is working on a solution, but I would not recommend the game until the issues are fixed.",1,1,0,149,655,15,209,8,9,69.26,8.23,8.46,11.48

"This is Amazing and in my opinion the Best game I ever played.. Well it's more then just a game. You can create so much like movies, music, art and yes, you can create your own games. There is also tons of games and other stuff from other creators. The possibilities are limitless.",5,5,0,54,219,4,73,5,4,81.51,4.57,5.31,7.28
"Dreams is less a 'game' and more a platform for creativity. It is Media Molecule taking the spirit of Little Big Planet to the next level, but not in a small leap but in bounds. If LBP gave people a galaxy of possibilities for design and creativity, Dreams gives them the universe. There's already a nearly bottomless selection of experiences to play through, some brilliant and many forgettable, but the pure joy comes from taking part in what others have created. There's a charm in that which not everyone will appreciate. Also, if you are not planning on ever delving into the creative tools yourself, you will not get to enjoy Dreams to its fullest potential and it may feel like half an experience for you. However, I do feel like a lot of people who go in not intending to be creative will be inspired by what they play from others and will decide to take the plunge themselves. This obviously would not appeal to all, and therefore that is why I feel this game is truly a masterpiece and a revolution of sorts in terms of the power put in gamers' hands. I also like the price being $40. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it for what potential it has. You never know when that spark of creativity might arrive, and Dreams will give you the tools to do something meaningful with it.",5,2,1,236,1027,28,345,11,10,61.38,10.03,8.41,13.33
"Dreams is really a hard game to review, because your enjoyment will largely depend on what you want to do with it. If youre looking just to play games, youll likely be initially impressed with the variety of genres that are available. However, like all user generated content games, the quality of these games will vary greatly, so youll probably have to play through some garbage to get to the good stuff. The included story made by the developers is great, but only lasts 2-3 hours. As a creation tool though, Dreams offers you the most comprehensive suite of creation tools ever created in a regular video game. You can sculpt, paint art, make music, animations, and of course games. However, it will take a good deal of time to both learn how to make things, and then actually make them. So overall, I would recommend Dreams to you right now in early 2020 if you enjoy creating digital art, or you enjoy playing/testing other peoples creations. If that doesnt sound interesting to you, I would wait a while to see where the community takes the game in the coming months and years. *PS PLUS is not currently required to share/play peoples creations online. However, online multiplayer is not a thing yet, so that may become a requirement if it gets added.",4,1,0,225,1004,30,332,11,10,61.24,9.8,8.99,13.52
"When it comes to success, Dreams should be the next Minecraft. Like that game, its biggest strength is endless creativity. But unlike that game, you don't need to be a creative thinker to get the most out of the game. Instead you can play thousands of experiences that are created by others, all from a wide variety of genres. The negative reviews complained about the complexity of creating something (which should be expected when it includes essentially an entire video game development software suite and you can literally create ANYTHING), but neglected to admit they may have been better suited to just enjoy the experiences created by other people. Like any artform, the skills necessary to create interactive experiences requires dedication, it is an endeavor that takes far more time to get good at than people might expect. If you find out you don't have the patience, no worries, you have an infinite amount of content to experience as a player. One of the best things about Dreams is what's called Dream Surfing. You pick tags of the kind of things you are interested in seeing, click a button, and are instantly transported to an experience. If you don't particularly care for what you are seeing from one experience, just pause and click the next button. Each experience loads in about 1-2 seconds, so you can quickly experience a wide variety of creations. Like many fans of the company who made LittleBigPlanet and Tearaway, I bought the game digitally through early access. I hate to see that the game is missing out on hundreds of five star reviews because of this, which may eventually impact its sales for the physical version. Media Molecule had worked on this game for 6 years and incredibly generous with the $40 original price. This game is worth so much more than that, you won't regret buying something that has infinite content.",5,1,0,323,1499,45,503,15,12,53.23,11.18,10.11,14.19
"This is a great game lots of fun you can also make your own game's in this but you will have to dedicate a lot of time and effort to make it worth your while and not have crap game's out there. They should think about adding this to the PS5 when it launches it could really enhance the experience on the new console just include it with the system and it would probably be even better on the next Gen console. But I think it's worth the purchase now anyways who knows if you buy a PS5 they may even give you the free update to the game for free when the new system comes out anyway we can only hope.",5,0,1,125,472,7,159,3,18,56.93,15.67,5.69,18.91
"I thought at first that the creations that would be possible in this game would be very limited. I was proven very wrong when upon playing the game I was able to play all sorts of genres and they are full-fledged games.

The game library is also really fun. Content is uploaded daily by users who have created their own games. So many things to choose from.",5,0,1,93,388,16,141,7,5,65.09,7.48,6.5,12.2

"The guys that made Little Big Planet made this game. This is basically a good teaching skill for how game design works. They give you a tool set that lets you create your own games and its surprisingly robust. You can also try out games other people have made in addition to the several games that come with this tool set that were made in engine to show you examples of what you can make. This is a great game on its own but its an even better tool for learning the basics of game design. In the style of the older classics like RPG maker, and Fighter Maker. Intro is a bit long and you have to play it before it lets you into the game proper like the LBP games. Tip, do use the tutorials to learn how to set up you games, they are very well done.",5,0,1,150,588,7,192,8,7,79.52,6.83,5.67,9.37
"Dreams is a fantastic, innovative game where you can basically create whatever you want or play what everyone else is making. It's from the creators of LittleBigPlanet so you know it's a quality game. People are already making games in it based on real games and they look a lot like them. Things like Fallout 4, Dead Space, Sonic, Ghost of Tsushima, Crash Bandicoot and so on and that's not even mentioning all of the great original content they are making. Load times on non existent too. You just jump into one level and if you don't iike it you find something else to play and immediately start playing it .",5,0,1,114,486,14,166,6,9,64.36,9,7.71,12.51

"As the developers have mentioned this game has nothing to do with the mobile version. This is a tag-team fighting game at its core and was developed with the help of known fighting game pros Clockwork and Justin Wong for example. Its similar to Marvel vs Capcom and Dragon Ball FighterZ in terms of gameplay. It does support Crossplay between Switch, PC, and Xbox (very few fighting games do this). This is BIG as I rarely have difficulty finding matches online due to the larger player pool versus the PS4 version. Gameplay controls are great for newcomers and pros. I like the approach taken with the control scheme. Non-fighting game players can get in on the fun and more experience players can make use of the more advanced combos/techniques. It does support player invite. So you can play against your friends online. Has a story mode and arcade mode as well as a basic tutorial. My only gripe for the physical is that it is true that the Kimberly Skin and Drakkon V2 Skin are not on the disc as stated (contacted Nway and they are supposedly going to send those codes out) All DLC is either for characters or skins. So there is no pay to win. This comes with Season One only. Wished it had Season Two on the cart. But I knew how many characters were available going in. Overall, I do enjoy this game as a power ranger and fighting game fan. It has become my top played fighting game at the moment.

However, this version is missing the advertised character skins for Kimberly Hart (the Pink Ranger) and Evo 2 Lord Drakkon. This is of particular note, since these skins cannot be downloaded individually thus requiring you to purchase and download the entire Collector's Edition digital bundle of the game to unlock them. These skins ARE present on the physical PS4 version (though that version is also missing content in the form of an entire character, The Gold Zeo Ranger, who at least is present on Switch).",3,3,1,108,498,13,165,4,14,50.18,12.97,10.22,15.61

It's still bloated with DLC and additional payments. This box is supposed to include a lot of that but it won't matter. Even with the best characters the game is EXTREMELY UNFUN to play. The controls are rigid, characters are very limited and boring, the pick 3 and a megazord thing doesn't work out to improve gameplay at all. It's a really bad boring game of rock paper scissors. It's not even that it's overly simplistic it's poorly designed and implemented. I'm a huge lifelong Power Rangers fan. Skip this game.",1,9,12,133,535,12,188,10,5,73.75,6.28,5.63,8.93

"This includes Assassin Creed III, Liberation and basically all of the DLC that originally came out for the games. I got these games as a bonus included with AC Origins Deluxe. Having only started playing AC with the Ezio collection, I missed a lot of the earlier AC games including these two, so I was happy to get these as a bonus included with Origins Deluxe. I have played most of the AC games in the last few years though and if there is one thing that is a bit of a negative with playing the older games, is how much smoother the newer AC games play as compared to these. These are remasters with better graphics but since I have never played the games when they originally came out, I cant compare the graphics before to the remaster. The graphics are decent but they dont quite match the latest AC games. There are also numerous graphic glitches and things of that nature that older games are known for. In a lot of ways, these two games remind me of the Ezio collection that got me hooked onto the AC games. With that being said, like the Ezio collection, the gameplay controls and environment interaction and movement feel awkward to me as compared to the much smoother Origins, Odyssey, etc. Fighting/stealth is definitely not as smooth, but I try to keep in mind that this game is much older than what I have been used to playing in recent months, so I am willing to be a little more forgiving in that respect. The tutorial seems to be a bit of an afterthought for these two games, but at least there is a basic explanation of the game. The menus are a bit cumbersome, but not enough to be too annoying to utilize. Maybe these games are not as big as the most recent AC games, there is still lots to see and do, especially since both games include all of its content. It is interesting to explore the varies areas around the cities. There is a variety of different quests to do throughout and has the familiarity of what I am used to doing in AC games. Of course, there is some of the boring collectable stuff and some meaningless side quests that can make it a bit of a choir to complete. I am not a bit multi-player fan, so that is not much of a factor for me. One small frustration is the occasional crash of the game on my PS4. I would expect a bit of a smoother port of these remasters without major hiccups. Although I am not quite familiar with the original, I am glad they have made some game improvements (based on what I have read) that would have probably been extremely frustrating. Being a remaster, those that have played the original and liked it will most likely enjoy this one, but the game is still with some frustrations that should have been fixed with the update. Overall, I like this and I am satisfied to get a chance to play these when I didnt originally. They do show their age in gameplay and other issues though. 3.5 stars",3,0,1,539,2275,54,759,25,10,65.82,9.43,7.65,12.63

"I respectfully disagree with the lower rated review because you can't say Valkyria Revolution isn't like Valkyria Chronicles gameplay without taking into account that Chronicles is a lot older and games evolve in some cases. Nonetheless, I would say Valkyria Chronicles is the Final Fantasy 6 or 7 of the series where Revolution is the Final Fantasy 15 of the bunch. It's really good but it's not Final Fantasy 6 or 7 and no one should go into it expecting it to be since JRPGs were much difference during the time. It's worth buying at this price because it's already pretty cheap. Sega needs people to show love to their quality games like this and Yakuza if we ever want more games to come to the states like this one. Not buying this game and future releases that are similar means Sega is less likely to take a risk in bringing stuff like this over to the U.S. Sonic Mania and Forces can probably survive a price drop if they're not good because they will most likely still sell okay and get new entries of some sort. Pick this game up, it's fun. No it's not Persona 5 or Final Fantasy but if you're done with those this should be next in line. P.S. first prints come with some cute little extras so if you wait that might not be available in later prints (soundtrack and pins).",5,2,0,249,1020,28,350,13,8,68.48,8.47,6.74,12.16

In the first hour of the game, there is 5 minutes of actual game play. The rest is loading screens and so much talking. There are a lot of cut scenes and I'm not against that but it has to load every time one start. The worst part is the loading screens aren't quick. Running it on my PS4 Pro, the loading screens are just as long as the scenes themselves. The graphics are another disappointment. The moving painting style ruins a lot for me because it's in every scene. It's like a bad filter over an anime. Besides all of the technical mediocrities, the story itself is slow and lackluster. The combat is fast and is often over before you know it. I'm not sure if a diehard fan could get passed all of these hangups.",1,2,1,177,706,11,234,17,3,84.42,4.07,4.81,6.65
"While I really enjoy this game's characters, the story, the soundtrack, and the boss battles, there's a lot of annoyances here. If any of the following turn you off, you may not enjoy this game: 1. There are TONS of cutscenes, more than actual gameplay, and the cutscenes are split up by a TON of loading screens. I haven't seen this many loading screens in a game since Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Luckily, this game's a lot better than that one. 2. Gameplay takes a backseat to the story. Personally, I'm a fan of many of the characters, so the story is interesting to me. I'm normally not one for anime, however I am enjoying this. That said, it's too bad that they're so frequent since I'd like to be able to enjoy more of the gameplay if there was more of it. 3. Graphically, I think the game looks pretty nice, however it's still pretty dated with stilted & robotic animations that would be more at home in a PS2 game. This doesn't bother me much since many Japanese games are behind western games in this regard. There's a lot to like here, however there's a lot to dislike too, so just be aware of that before buying.",4,1,0,221,869,24,310,14,5,72.14,7.12,5.45,10.66

"Most gamers are familiar with the Fallout series and Fallout 4 is a great game with plenty to do and see, especially with the GOTY edition which includes all of the available DLC. The standard edition also provides a lot of things to do, places to go, people to see, mutants to eliminate. The GOTY version will be on sale for the 2017 Black Friday sale so that would be a good time to pick up the complete version which should keep you busy for a really long time.

"Fallout 4 is not a bad looking game, most of the time. It's got a decent story, most of the time. It's even got some interesting gameplay mechanics, again, most of the time. Nothing ever comes full circle in Bethesda's new blockbuster. After a tumultuous production, the belated 4th entry in the 'Fallout' is what happens when you take the turkey out of the oven too soon.",2,1,0,70,291,8,103,5,6,68.14,7.23,6.53,10.17

"Fallout 4 is a great continuation of the Fallout series. It includes a lot more of what made Fallout 3 & New Vegas great: a massive world to explore, with enough choices to keep you coming back for more.

For crying out loud, I'm just over here trying to have a decent run to start out in the UFC and I go from facing a homeless man they brought in from outside the arena, to facing Rumble Johnson. Things escalated very quickly. I don't like that even on a low difficulty the game is still ridiculously hard to play leisurely. Graphics are pretty solid, announcers are as annoying as they always are, and I haven't touched this since a couple days after I purchased it.

"I really wanted to enjoy this game, but there is far too many things wrong with it, preventing me from not returning it. Which I did today. Grappling Is a huge part of the sport and granted it is very intricate and very hard to replicate but both of EA sports attempts at creating it have failed tremendously. Undisputed 3 is still the best UFC game made to date in my mind. The best thing about this game is the graphics and presentation of fighters. That's great and all but I'm pretty sure nobody pays for the real pay per view events to watch fighters walk to the ring get rubbed down, and then introduced. I'm sure they'll try again in another few years, and I'll be there patiently waiting to see what has improved.

"everyone knows Kojima and his crazy weirdo antics so Im sure you know what to expect. Im a big fan of his work, and I love this game but its simply isnt for everyone. its a slow burn that demands commitment. the game makes traversal its main priority. theres combat (combat is okay, I enjoy it but recognize it isnt the greatest), but its not the focus. main enemy is the environment and how you traverse and overcome it to get your packages to point a to b while keeping said packages in top quality. while it can be upsetting when you fail to deliver, its never the games fault. you can make it to point b if youre smart about it, and the game always worked well. if I messed up, it was my own doing. the game is also super pretty and the soundtrack, dude the soundtrack is amazing. this game is so gorgeous and has so many gorgeous moments. the story told is really cheesy and pretty pretentious at times but I personally found it super enjoyable and loved it. my biggest issue really is just the combat. like I said earlier, it works but its not the greatest. while its not the focus, it wouldve benefited if the combat had been worked on a lot more. its only noticeably wonky at the mandatory fights. the bosses generally fall down to relocating every now and then and just shooting. theres option for stealth but the stealth is wonky as well. the monster fights are a lot better but still fall under the wonkiness and generally are the same relocate/shoot stuff. its enjoyable, but dont expect mgs6. if you dont like slow burns, stay away and please stop spreading misinformation about it also crazy how relevant this game is to this corona virus situation we have going on kojima u psycho",4,1,0,314,1349,36,460,21,7,67.72,7.53,7.48,10.57
"I've seen so many reviews of this game going from one end to the other, and I would admit this game is not for everyone, are you into fast action, racing or don't have a lot of time, this is not the game for you. Are you more into story, immersion, and you enjoy weird, convoluted stories that would take forever to uncover, even months or years? (Remember Metal Gear 5 and the nukes discovery after more than a year after launch?). I might have a bias, but I've really enjoyed all the Kojima entries since MGS1 for the original Play Station and is not just the gameplay (which is actually pretty fun), the story and emotional involvement is as good as it can get. I'm 44+ hours in, and I'm sure this will be my next Witcher-like adventure. If you have a chance to try it first with a friend, that might work if you're deciding to get it or not. I liked it so much that I ordered the collectors edition after purchasing the special edition. I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend, just as I wouldn't recommend any of the dark souls' titles.",5,1,0,206,811,22,285,9,9,66.56,9.66,6.06,13.43

"Do not believe the down play of this game. Yes, death stranding is definitely not for everyone and is a walking heavy game, but far from a walking simulator. This game is much deeper then ppl have given it credit for and it's a shame. Its visual stunning, the soundtrack is amazing,the controls are smooth and responsive and the story is indulging. I personally love it and I'm not a kojima fanboy. My advice would be to at least give it a try. Its take a little to build up, but it's worth it when it gets going for sure.",5,1,0,104,408,9,143,7,5,75.43,6.43,5.28,9.4

At first organizing the menu can be tedious but then you get the hang of it after chapter 2. The creature (BT's) encounters are nerve racking and intense. All in all very good game for it's storytelling and mechanics.

If you like RPGs and don't hate building games, I think this is a great buy.",5,2,0,76,299,4,99,5,5,81.2,5.71,5.39,8.19
"First off, before I begin the review, I just want to let everyone know that if you own a Nintendo Switch and are curious about this game, there is a free demo on the Nintendo eShop you can download AND on the main menu of the main game there is an option to 'Continue from Demo' to bring your progress over. I absolutely loved the original Dragon Quest Builders. I finished it 100% and loved every chapter. However, starting Dragon Quest Builders 2, you immediately see just how many quality-of-life changes they made to the gameplay that makes it a much better experience! To quickly sum the new things up: - There is now a stamina meter for your character to run. - You can play online with friends (must have Nintendo Switch online membership and reach a certain point in the single player campaign for this feature to unlock). - Your weapons/tools are no longer breakable. - You have a companion that travels with you helping you defeat enemies and pick up items. - Your tools/weapons are assigned to different buttons now. - There is a robust photo editor where you can take pictures and post them on the DQB2 message boards (think Super Mario Odyssey photo editor). - You can upload your creations as well as visit other people's islands to see their creations through the DQB2 message board. - Your hunger meter is now a percentage (0-100% as opposed to five slices of bread) - Defeating enemies still give you items but it also gives you experience you use to level up you and your companion. - There is DLC on the way that adds even more items and quests for you to enjoy. - Physical version has stackable slime DLC code inside AND a reversible cover that matches the artstyle of the first one! (see photo) Essentially, if you enjoyed Dragon Quest Builders, you will LOVE Dragon Quest Builders 2! It plays more like an RPG than the first one and you'll find yourself constantly building new structures! The story keeps you playing and the quests are fun as they reward you with new items to craft. The writing is also FANTASTIC...the characters are hilarious and the dialogue is cheeky! I hope this review helped you out. I am still currently playing through this (have been for about 10 hours now) and have been addicted every second. If you are on the fence, again try the eShop demo...you may be surprised at how much you enjoy it! :)",5,4,2,419,1855,42,608,24,9,66.35,8.34,8.54,10.99
"I was so excited for this game since the original DQB is one of my favorite games of all time. So far this game expands on the original and I am loving it. HOWEVER, the reason I'm only giving 2 Stars (otherwise I would give it 5) is the performance. The Switch is just not powerful enough to run this game. It lags and stutters SO BAD just from moving the camera around to the point where it's very jarring. Maybe Square Enix has factored in that some people may not notice things like framerate drops, but for me this is inexcusable. Admittedly, the lag is not so bad in handheld mode because the resolution drops down to 720p. So if you plan to only play in handheld mode this may be OK for you, but in my opinion it is unplayable in docked mode. I was VERY upset to buy this on Switch only to turn around and have to spend another $60 to purchase it AGAIN for the PS4! It is very disappointing because I wanted to be able to take this on the go, but I predominantly play on a TV and the performance issues are not worth it. I would highly recommend skipping this version and getting the PS4 version which runs smoothly and flawlessly at 60fps!",2,2,1,223,905,22,314,11,8,67.14,8.93,6.6,12.06
"If you don't want any story or structure just play Minecraft, otherwise try this. Really fun and a great sequel to the first game. I guess if you didn't like the first one you wouldn't really like this but if you had any fondness for it you should adore this. It's a refined but similar gameplay experience. Yes, some of the scriptings are obviously intended for a Linear A->B style playthrough but there's as much freedom as you want outside the specific, story-driven tasks.",4,2,3,91,377,11,130,5,8,67.5,8.37,6.93,12.12

"If you played the first Dragon Quest Builders game and enjoyed it at all, then you definitely need to buy the sequel - its has everything that made the first game fun, plus tons more content, plus fixes a lot of flaws that the first game had (such as having to leave the areas you built up once they were 'done'. Its now possible to revisit previous lands, and in fact somewhat necessary for gathering materials.) If you haven't played the first Dragon Quest Builders game, then its probably best described as 'Minecraft but with a story.' The game is set in a world that's largely been destroyed by evil. You play a 'builder' - a person with the rare ability to create new things, while the rest of humanity scrounges in the ruins trying to avoid being killed by monsters. You travel to various lands, each of which has a ruined town that you must rebuild, inspiring the people to move into your town and eventually take back the world from the monsters. You're responsible for building them homes and defenses, and completing quests (which tend to unlock new things you can build or cause new people to move into your town.) The first Dragon Quest Builders game was good, but DQB2 improves on it in basically every way. I would consider it one of the best games on the Switch at this time, and would say everyone should at least give it a try.",5,0,1,247,1065,23,340,9,13,62.53,11.36,8.47,14.7
"The first Builders was fun with its blend of RPG and Minecraft style building, but didnt feel quite the best in either of those aspects, it was great for being the combination. The sequel upgrades ever, its much easier to enjoy things purely for the building aspect, and its a far more enjoyable RPG, and still that magic combination of the two elevating it higher.",5,0,1,65,294,9,99,2,17,45,15.06,9.88,18.54
"DQB2 improves over the original with Bigger open world areas to build and Awesome story. Its very addicting to build a whole town and watch the villagers interact with it. You can level your character and your villages. The more you level up the more new things you and your friends can do. This game also has online co-op and offline. Its really worth the price and if you get it on sale its a steal.",5,0,1,77,319,9,107,6,5,76.25,5.81,6.25,9.81

"This game is packed! The first game was fantastic, except everyone hated losing their city. No worries in number 2, they heard what was good and bad and totally made this sequel. There's soooo much to do, build, story, and even multiplayer. Traveling, storing and building is better and AI of characters helps with mundane tasks making it less burdensome which allows me to explore, build or fight more. Great game, must have in a Nintendo switch collection, this is coming from a person that didn't think he'd like Minecraft mechanics and here I am, playing the sequel!",5,0,1,101,454,11,145,6,9,68.29,7.92,8.87,11.09

The game is a substantial improvement over it's predecessor and I prefer the opportunity to go back to my original fort that this game finally allows. Minecraft and RPG fusion is really fun.",5,0,1,61,268,13,101,5,6,54.38,8.71,7.61,13.4
"This game exceeded my expectations in every aspect. The graphics are superb and the multiplayer experience is like none other with vast load outs, destructible environments, etc. With Battlenet, you can even track and make changes to your character with a mobile smart phone.

"This is my first go at a Battlefield game and having been a Call of Duty player for the last 6 years I've been getting bored with the same old game so to say the least I was blown away with Battlefield 4. The campaign was fun and intense for me I enjoyed it however the end could've used more of an ending. There is a huge learning curve in multiplayer especially going into a Conquest game play but if one stays with it beyond the first few frustrating games adaption happens rather quickly. Unlike Call of Duty there is no party so friends have to join your game session and getting paired up can take some time which can be a little fustrating. Also unlike CoD this game is ridiculously more true to life with recoil and bullet drop so sniping takes work to lead shots and adjust for distance. I love the option to adjust your gun/equipment class while your in the game and the option to choose spawn points. The vehicles are amazing while standing in the middle of it all you will see dog fights in the air and helicopters buzzing all around while the ground and building explode due to a tank battle. CoD is great for just shooting at each other, BF4 is great for teamwork and experiencing a battlefield in a war zone.",4,3,0,233,982,15,313,8,13,63.63,11.62,7.97,14.23
"Being a FPS and global warfare fan, this game did not fall short of my expectations. Initially I purchased this, but returned it for the special edition of the game that included the China Rising expansion. They were the same price for a little more content in the special edition (highly recommended you double check what you are purchasing before you buy so you don't make the same mistake as I did). The single-player campaign was awesome, seemed like I was in charge of a movie. While I'm not a fan of how the cinematics are getting in video games, it was still pretty freaking awesome! The progression and length it took just on normal felt pretty on par with what to expect. The multiplayer so far has been amazing! The global warfare is awesome. I've always been a fan of the Battlefield series, even Bad Company, because the ability to switch classes and go from soldier to pilot to commander, or equipment operator in an AC-130 just blows me away. The graphics are said to be better than the Xbox One (running 720p vs. 900p in the PS4), but all in all the gameplay is what makes this great. The progression through multiplayer gets you hooked with trying to constantly achieve new rewards and unlocks. The fully destructible environment made me sit in awe the first time I watched a huge mutli-story building fall and crumble before me... Then the next time I was inside as it happened and had no idea why I was 'Killed in Action' until I realized it wasn't a timer making the building fall..... It was the constant barrage of shells and rockets that made the building deteriorate and crumble with me in it. The game is a great addition to the series, and cudos to the developers for this one. I look forward to the additions in the future, and think the 'season pass' (Battlefield Premium) is totally worth it.",5,3,0,334,1444,34,482,17,9,64.81,9.1,8.11,11.93
"Me and my buddies are Call of Duty fans, so it was difficult to make a transition to Battlefield. Overall this game is far superior to COD games, HOWEVER you don't have the ability to do private matches and it is extremely difficult to get into the same game with friends. If you are playing solo, this is the game to go with, if you have a group you want to play online with, stick with COD.",4,3,0,78,307,9,106,3,11,65.48,10.59,6.2,15.02

"This game is fantastic, period. Most people buy the Battlefield and Call of Duty franchises for one reason, online multi-player, and this game has it on lockdown. The size of the maps and the player interaction changes depending on what game mode you choose. If you want to have an intense, bloody, all out infantry confrontation your maps will be just the right size. More interested in sitting back and sniping people off from a mile away? Play one of the larger map game modes. Want to play for objectives in an intense, all out war on a massive scale? Yeah, we've got that for you. Some of these maps on the bigger games modes are so massive it is hard to believe you are: A - playing on a console / B - playing a video game at all! I was in an Obliteration game and was sitting on top of a sky scraper, picking people off that were running by on the street below with a 40 time magnitude zoom. All of a sudden I hear a massive explosion and the building starts to cave-in/collapse. I end up jumping off and parachuting the the ground several blocks away, all the while watching the carnage as I float down. The single player campaign, while 'thrilling' at times is not the reason to buy this game. It's all about the multi-player. The only thing that bugs me is that you cannot play split screen, either local or online so to play with your friends you will need to play from multiple televisions with multiple systems on multiple ip addresses.",5,2,0,272,1143,21,377,15,8,71.17,7.84,7.28,10.34

It was like shooting ironman and then he just hits you ones and it's over. Also don't expect a big blast to kill anyone. I took out walls and it didn't hurt anyone on the other side.

Fortunately for me (or so I thought), I wasn't running into any of the bugs...until I got a significant way through the game. That's when I decided to try my hand at some of the online play with 1 of those friends. We had trouble getting on the same side and when we did, we had trouble hearing each other. It was fun, but I was thinking the whole time how much better it would be if I could hear my friend. On top of that, the game crashed at 1 point. No problem, just restarted and kept playing. Next day, I go to play campaign and, to my dismay, my save file was corrupted and my progress lost. After learning my lesson, I made sure after every mission that my progress was saved to psn...until it crashed again most of the way through a mission and lost that. This happened to at least 2 of my friends. If they could fix the bugs I'd probably give it a 5. I wouldn't even recommend playing it until the bugs are fixed.

"The on-ice gameplay is much improved this year, but it doesn't matter when you can't get into games. There are so many error codes, bugs and glitches that it often takes 40 minutes to get into one 25 minute game. It's nonsense and it's been this way since the game launched on September 14th, which is 2 months ago. So for 2 months this dev team has known about the game-breaking issues and done nothing. It's insulting to their entire customer base. And they changed so much about lobbies/matchmaking from 18 that it has ruined the 'playing with friends' experience. You are endlessly taken out of the dressing room/lobby you are in with your friends or people you just played with online. So you have to essentially re-group after nearly every game and it's a giant headache. In 18 you were always left in the same dressing room with whomever you just played with and it was super easy. Now it's ruined and the fluidity of playing with others has been destroyed in a mode that is about playing with others. Gigantic EA failure.",1,2,1,196,818,12,267,11,8,73.5,7.43,7.08,9.58
"NHL 19 finally improves the feel of skating and checking, which haven't felt quite right since NHL 14. Gameplay feels much improved compared to the last few years. However, the game still has many issues. Poke checking and stick lifting continue to be abused when playing online; they're too effective and it ruins the pacing of a game. Speaking of online, input lag and poor peer to peer connections continue to ruin the majority of matches, even if you have a high quality connection yourself. I find this isn't the case as often with Madden, but it continues to plague NHL year after year. Roster updates continue to be too slow/inaccurate (as opposed to Madden's weekly updates). Commentary is fine, but not dynamic like in Madden and NBA 2K so it feels antiquated. The player models are terrible except for the occasional star player they scanned correctly. The graphics, sound, and presentation are in a serious need of updating. There continues to be no story mode like other sports franchises have been adding the past few years and all you're left with is a shallow-feeling Be a Pro mode from last generation. The new World of Chel modes like Ones (1 v 1 v 1 hockey on a pond) or returning Threes (fast paced arcade hockey) are nice additions and can be fun to change things up. However, I can't help but feel too many resources go into these minor things that most players aren't even looking for instead of focusing on the core experience. Passing is one area that feels in need of an upgrade; rarely does the mechanic execute the way I want it to when in the offensive zone or rushing on a breakout. There never seems to be enough time/space to incorporate the D players in the offensive zone either, as the cpu instantly cuts off any shot or pass you try to organize from the point. Gameplay definitely improved, but it still doesn't feel as fun as it used to. I've played every NHL since 2004, and it just isn't hitting those same highs like some of those older games. If you're into hockey, this year's game brings back some of the fun with the improvements to skating and checking, but just know that many more improvements need to be made for this series to return to its former glory.",3,1,0,410,1753,46,587,18,11,62.59,10.19,8.04,13.6

"Imagine if Resident Evil 1 starred a nobody and took place in first person. That's the simplest way of describing RE7. And that's a good thing! RE7's main plot is far removed from the usual Umbrella shenanigans and deals with issues much closer to home. In fact you are on a plantation in Louisiana cut off from the world trying to rescue your wife from a crazy family. It's more than that of course but that would be spoiling a lot of surprises. The game really plays like RE1 with bizarre puzzles, ammo sponge bosses, creepy enemies, item conservation and limits on what you can carry but there's modern touches too, like no limits on how often you can save (but saving is limited by location and special auto save checkpoints) and having a bit more mobility. In 2D this game is scary and graphic. Probably the most extreme visually speaking. Decay in all forms throughout the game. In VR the game really shines. And it's the entire experience too. You can aim and shoot with your head and lean around corners without exposing yourself. And everything literally is in your face now. If you are squeamish VR might push you. Game takes about 10 hours to beat. Usual first time length for an RE. But since this is the gold edition there is all the DLC to explore. Not A Hero I hear is the best but I haven't gotten a chance to play them all yet. In time... Really I have no complaints about this package or game. RE7 was a much needed shot of creativity to the series while returning back to what we loved about RE games in the first place: survival horror.",5,8,0,294,1232,30,415,22,5,73.85,6.28,6.63,9.43
"I've played this game in VR mode, so that is what I'm basing this short review off of. The game does a good job of being scary in the same way the first one did 2 decades ago. The VR actually adds to the experience and I don't think I will ever forget the dread I felt the first time I had to walk into the darkness. The controls work really good and the game does a good job of restricting your view as you move faster, keeping the camera from making me feel queasy. If you have PSVR and want to be scared, play this game. Made the purchase of the headset feel totally worth it.",5,4,1,120,451,7,152,6,7,79.38,7.16,4.82,10.33

But a note to collectors with a focus on preservation: The 'Gold Edition' features (aka, all of the DLC that is included on the disc) cannot be found on the main menu until the Day One patch is installed.

This is one of the best games for virtual reality to date and this mode is included at no cost. This isn't a lazy port to VR either. RE7 feels like it was designed around this concept instead of shoehorning it in at the end. There are more than a few truly terrifying moments in this game - even better, Resi 7 doesn't rely on jump scares for its horror. The claustrophobic and eerie atmosphere make every moment tense. One thing I'd like to mention is that this game made me feel physically sick, (dizzy and nauseous) especially while watching someone else play, VR mode fixed this entirely for me. There are other people who have also experienced this so keep that in mind when purchasing.",5,2,1,159,706,18,234,10,8,66.19,7.98,8.45,10.89

"I bought this game when I bought my PS VR. It was so amazing in VR you feel like you are in the RE universe. Capcom made the game so good that you dont need to have VR to enjoy it.

"Although it retains a little bit of the Capcom cheesiness of previous Resident Evils, RE7 is much more immersive and terrifying than previous entries.

Some of the minigames are fun but nothing special.

This one is a complete newly experience that doesnt go deep into raccoon police department story but behind a sadistic family who undergoes a demonic presence of a little girl. The monsters are not zombies which i didnt like. I mean resident evil suppose to have zombies right?. The creature are scary looking but only few creatures were in this game. Overall this gold edition was what i looking for with the dlc. Was worth the wait i guess and price match it to gamestop. If you are a horror fan of Resident Evil games start with this one. RE 1 then past 5 and 6 RE 4 is good too.",5,1,0,117,493,12,166,9,5,73.61,6.22,6.7,9.3
"I use the full review scale so that is a very good score. There are a ton of experiences that I wouldn't waste my time on this generation, but RE7 is not one of them. And with the Gold Edition it's even better. The design of the game is great. You will frequently come across locked doors or things impeding your progress that you need something for. As you go along the other route, you find what you need and eureka moment, you now know what you need to bypass the barrier in true Metroidvania fashion. This extends into the DLC as well (at least with End of Zoe and Not a Hero). The game has excellent pacing and a cool, well thought out story. The pieces of the plot start to fall into place, shedding light on earlier details. Resource management is fun because you can save all your good stuff for the ending. Shame about the generic enemies, though. They also could've made the puzzles (if you can call them that) a little harder. Overall, it's nowhere near Resident Evil 4's level of quality, but like I said, it's a great game nonetheless made even better by the DLC. The DLC has the same great design as the main game, though with new mechanics. I highly recommend you play Not a Hero and End of Zoe. Even though their stories aren't all that, and they don't really add much to the main game as far as revelations are concerned (the files you can find are still entertaining, though), the gameplay in these DLCs is still great. All the DLC is on disc, except for Not a Hero which you need to download from the PS Store.",4,2,1,296,1197,23,395,17,7,76.27,6.95,6.28,10.07
"This game really messed with my head the first time I played through it. It is scary, strategic and above all, it is survival horror because I felt like I was surviving playing this game. I am a huge fan of the series and genre so for me this was not even a question to buy. BONUS: The Gold Edition has all the DLC which are extremely fun and they come at a savings by buying it as an all in one package.",5,1,0,83,315,7,110,4,7,73.65,8.14,5.09,11.67
"A great turning point for the Resident Evil series. Whereas Resi 4 took the series too far into the third person action territory, Resi 7 brings it back to the weird, B-Movie horror/adventure game roots. This is the real step forward for the franchise. The first person perspective put you squarely in the character shoses and let you experience the world first hand. It does stumble with some of the design choices, characters, and enemies but it keeps it from derailing by having great graphics, controls, interaction and immersion. Resident Evil 1 light if you will. Not a perfect game but a step in the right direction.",4,1,0,109,502,14,165,7,9,62.97,8.35,9.38,11.37

"First, it's amazing that this game is running on Switch. It's an excellent port done by Panic Button. Second, there are a few caveats attached to the Switch version, including its 30 FPS target, which occasionally sees framerates dip well below that creating a jarring effect, as well as pretty low resolution textures which give the game a much softer edge and bit of blur on Nintendo's console. Yet, the ability to play anywhere is still why this is a very worthwhile port, and despite the hiccups mentioned, it sticks very closely to the 30 FPS for almost all the action and even features motion assisted aiming. Meanwhile, the ability to revive your partner online or off makes some of the brutally challenging moments much more forgivable and less frustrating.",4,1,1,133,619,17,206,5,14,48.8,13.06,10.45,15.75
"All I can say is that Wolfenstein Youngblood is a gigantic disappointment. The Switch is not a console to buy AAA games and expect the same performance in the graphics department as you would in other consoles. That's fine, at least for me it is, rather I'm more concerned with making sure the game doesn't lag and it provides the same exact in game content that you would fine on other consoles. YB runs OK for the most part, but the things that are wrong with it are: -It's unnecessarily muddy looking. -You're forced to download the game because there's no cartridge. -The storyline is not great or original. -The gunplay is sadly boring. -The co-op option is pointless. -The game lags when a lot of enemies are on screen and things start happening. -Enemies are bullet sponges. It gets extremely frustrating when the difficulty spikes become unfair. The game becomes less rewarding because it's not challenging in that fun way but more so cause it's doesn't have the same proper difficulty mix that other Wolfenstein games have. I seriously would avoid this at all costs. If you do decide to get it, even though I am a big fan of the Switch, I really would not recommend getting it for this console.

The art book is full of fan art and also a lot of design art for characters, and the game comes in this cool collectible box.

"I have been a big fan of this series since the first game came out. each game has played different the other and that is the same for this game. This game is much more difficult then the other two game and in the beginning seem very limited with combat. After about an hour of game-play you get your first power up that helps with the combat as up until this point you have only really had one attack button and not many combos for attacking. also unlike the previous two games, you will not be able to just power smash your way through enemies and you will have to dodge and plan your attacks. There are some issues here and there with graphics and camera angle (fire being blocky at the beginning of the game, camera panning between charterers in cut scenes not smooth, camera angle in small areas) Other then these issues (could most likely get patched) and getting use to the new play style, i am enjoying this game very much. after the first hour the combat is fun and challenging, the story is good so far (minus some bad voice over for a few characters). the few issue i have mentioned are why i am putting 4 star, if they patch these few issues i would give a 5 star for this game P.s. the darksiders series has had a interesting development history, with the 2nd and 3rd game almost never being made due to company buyout and bankruptcy. the only reason that the 3rd game was able to be made is the original team of the first two games created this new studio after THQ was shut down.",4,2,2,285,1186,25,391,11,12,64.47,10.7,7.53,13.87

Some enemy looks that changed that I didn't like and the feeling of some weapons changes I also didn't like, but that is minor. Overall. If you played PS1 original and liked it, then you would love this Remake. However if you are new to Medievil, you should still get the game.

"At a full $60 Eve is one of the most expensive VR titles available. The lack of a single player campaign mean it's a primarily online flight sim that has fantastic immersion and visuals. It's one of the best looking of the launch VR games and controls more like a simulation then an arcade game. It's held back by constant microtransaction currency pack encouragement of a free to play model. It has a high learning curve and you are put right into skill based online matches. I found I didn't have the time to grind or money to invest in microtransactions to level my character and ship up enough to find the game playable. I always felt underpowered and outgunned. If you have the disposable income the gameplay is fun, but it's held back by its price point, lack of single player, and pay to win business model. I indicated I'd recommend it to a friend, but only if they knew what they were getting into and were willing to pay a premium price for it.",3,10,4,182,759,18,260,9,9,65.45,9.15,7.26,12.04

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a reminder to why a lot of us enjoy gaming. Bloodstained is a beautiful side-scrolling adventure that was created from the mind of Castlevania Symphony of the Night godfather, Koji Igarashi (hence the Igavania term). I couldn't get enough of exploring this wonderful castle world. Every inch of it. Every secret. Every hidden boss or level. The story is pretty solid and the voice work is delivered in a campy American translation that will make you smile. Like Symphony of the Night, there are some RPG elements to this game where you will experiment with creating weapons, trying different styles of weapons (whips, swords, boots or pistols), along with armor that has different effects to your style of play. Bloodstained is about sitting back and enjoying a game the way it was meant to be played right out of the box. There are no paywalls, no microtransactions to boost stats, etc. The visuals, the game mechanics, the soundtrack and fun all come together. You would be hard pressed not to have this in your gaming collection.",5,1,0,184,859,30,282,12,9,61.61,8.47,9.72,12.66

"IGA really honed in the best aspects of his last few games he did and meshed the best parts of them into this game. the 2.5 3d takes some getting used to since most metroidvanias are 2d. But the game has amazingly tight controls. And you really can mix and match and play the game how you want to play it. And unlike SOTN this has 3 difficulty modes. There is lots of content here and there is 13 DLC patches coming out that will be for free. They could have charged the full 60 for this and I would have been happy with that price after playing this. Its a sign a game is good that you think about it when not playing it. And even after beating it you want to come back to it and play it again from scratch. This really is IGAs best work to date.",5,1,0,152,586,6,191,11,4,86.5,4.63,4.73,7.11
"I want to start off by saying it's a shame that the steel case doesn't come with the PS4/Xbox version, but I'm buyng a Switch copy so that I can get one, and I'll just let my friend borrow/keep the game Switch copy. The game itself is fantastic. Miriam's control is solid, plenty of weapons and items to find and craft, a diverse selection of enemies, sidequests, hidden rooms and lore, cosmetic items to accessorize your character, this game has it all! Bundle that with the expansive Shard system (basically the Soul System from Aria/Dawn of Sorrow) and you have a game to rival even the best that Castlevania has to offer. Konami made a huge mistake denying Igarashi-san to make another game. There is a story here, and while I can't say there was zero effort put into it, it's clearly to have an excuse for Miriam exploring an enormous castle filled with demons. Some of the cutscenes are a little janky, and the voice acting isn't the best ever, but they don't detract from the overall experience. The cutscenes are in real-time, so you can really enjoy all of Miriam's costume pieces (there are LOTS), which is a nice touch. I haven't gotten far in the game yet, but I have a lot more to do and I can't wait to jump back in. This is truly the game to rival Symphony of the Night, and will be fun over multiple playthroughs with different characters, weapons and abilities. Looking forward to the Switch release so I can store my game in the steel case.",5,1,0,283,1144,25,395,11,11,62.64,10.91,6.82,13.82

If you loved Castlevania Symphony of the Night I highly recommend this game. It is not full priced and that is a plus. The game has some glitches, small framerate stutters, and sometimes I could not pick up some items, but none of it was game breaking. If your on the fence go for it.

"The graphics and backgrounds are visually wonderful to look at, but the gameplay felt more like a knockoff Diablo. You can only pick from 2 characters (I use 'pick' lightly as you don't get to decide, but the game allows you to switch with your other coop player once you've played awhile) and neither character is female. I'm not sure why this isn't a four player coop game, you each use your own screen. LOTS of wordy tutorial screens whenever you get a new ability, but the abilities don't seem to build and you don't really feel a sense of leveling up. Even with the tutorial screens, there were still plenty of times we got stuck or couldn't figure out how to use an ability. In some cases the controls felt janky and we couldn't perform them.",3,0,1,145,589,13,198,6,10,66.78,9.95,6.86,13.25
"When I got the game, I opened it, popped it into my PS4, waited for the updates to download, started the game and met with 'Could not connect to WWZ servers'.... yay. Although since its launch, the servers worked well and havent had a problem since.... a few crashes sure and lost my data (But it was backed up, somehow). But with the recent update, havent had a problem since. Now for the game, the story is pretty short but a ton of fun if playing with friends or randoms online. There is Friendly Fire so be-careful not to shoot a teammate especially at a higher difficulty as you'll be taking a chunk of your teammate's health. It definitely has the Left 4 Dead vibe going with a bit of The Division. Now for the MP, the PVPVZ, also during launch, the MP was so laggy but with the recent update, it became a much smoother experience but anywho, that is also fun especially when there are rounds where a huge horde of zombies will come in and attack whoever they see. Gotta watchout for both the enemy team and zombies when going for the objectives. For $40 (Unless you got GCU then $32), you cant go wrong with that price.",5,4,0,214,874,13,293,11,8,71.26,8.15,6.69,10.21
"After watching the trailer and a few gameplay streams on Twitch, I decided to give World War Z a go. I bought the game for PS4, fired it up, next thing I know I'm with a few friends online having lots of fun exterminating zombies... lots of zombies... swarms of zombies. Such an awesome, fun game. The online multiplayer campaign is extremely fun but it is limited to just 4 levels, which can be completed in less than 24 hours. I hope the developers of the game eventually release new content, especially for the online multiplayer campaign, with various playable cities throughout the world, in order to keep the story moving forward. The game is currently extremely short, and that's my only complaint about it.",4,2,0,127,567,14,188,8,8,65.49,8.07,8.59,10.76

"World War Z is one of those rare licensed games that doesn't just happen to match the material, it blows by it, leaving the film in the dust. In fact, it's much, MUCH closer to the 'source-source' material, (the book,) in that it follows along with the titular WWZ by visiting different spots around the globe, each with its own cast of characters. Truly, however, WWZ the game, doesn't lean too heavily on story, although each of its 4 protagonists in its 4 locations get a background story told via a comic book style cutscene once you've finished a level with them. Each of the 4 locations has a small background told via radio transmission at the selection screen, and a set of transmitted objectives during each mission. Each location has 3 missions, except Tokyo, which inexplicably launched with two. (My guess is meeting launch deadline, as within 2 weeks of launch, the official Twitter account announced a 3rd mission and new special zombie type arriving in an upcoming update). That is one difference that doesn't come from either source, but rather video game tropes: special zombies. An unknown 5th is on the way, but currently, there's a Bull- a large SWAT officer that charges, grabs a party member and pummels them (or you,) until taken down. The Lurker, who hides in the shadows and will pin the victim to the ground, clawing away at them. The Screamer, a construction worker with a bullhorn whose screams continue to call in more zombies until he's quieted. Lastly, there's the Gas Bag, a former HAZMAT employee, complete in suit, who releases noxious fumes upon death. Pretty standard fare, in that regard. What isn't standard fare, (among the zombie side of things,) is the unparalleled size & scope of the zombie swarms re-enacting, in real-time, and in almost every case, interactively, the best scenes of mass zombie movement and attacks from the film. From flowing like a river through streets, to flinging themselves from great heights in pursuit of prey, to making 'pyramids' to scale walls, it's all impressive with no signs of slowdown, even on a base PS4. And while the comparisons to Left 4 Dead are certainly warranted, I'm not *entirely* certain it's completely fair- in all honesty, I've forgotten much of my playtime in L4D, so I'll leave that for you to decide. Yes, it's an up-to 4 person co-op shooter, although (and IMHO, at least on consoles,) better for being in 3rd person. It also features 8 person versus modes, complete with zombie hordes. Despite it being 4 person co-op, there are 6 different classes. Each class has its own permanent leveling tree. A gunmaster, explosives expert, medic, ammo support, melee, and an 'exterminator' who gains bonuses versus hordes and specials. Next up is a WIDE variety of weapons. While each class starts with a particular loadout which can't be changed initially, as you level that class, unlocked perks may give you a few different options, but most weapons will have to be found scattered around the maps. Like classes, each main and sidearm weapon will level up with use, unlocking more powerful versions of each of the many available. (Usually between 4 and 8 variants). After finishing a level, you'll earn some XP that you choose where to spend. Bank it? Unlock a perk for your class? Or, unlock a more powerful variant of your starting or favorite weapon? Because each class' skill tree only allows for 1 ACTIVE perk per branch, (3 different perks per branch,) playing with one team's gunslinger online may be different than landing on a team with a different player playing as that same class, as each player will personalize a class to their playstyle. Lastly, gameplay-wise, playing solo in WWZ isn't nearly as awful as similar online co-op games. The bots are generally capable, although far from perfect. They generally hold their own, help appropriately (ie, don't forget to try and save their own skin while attempting to help you,) and can be counted on for revives. Still, they're not above stepping in front of you and taking damage while you're shooting, and occasionally are known to crowd into you, clipping into your body/ view as you use a gun emplacement/ stationary weapon. (Hopping off the weapon and getting back on seems to fix this). Outside the game, the developers are extremely active with the community, genuinely overwhelmed by the love of the game by fans. They've been asking for feedback, error reporting, and wishlists of what to add, as they plan to continue to support the game for some time. This is a great game, even just to solo, scratching an itch for a co-op shooter that has been attempted many times since L4D, but not nearly as successfully as WWZ. At a retail price of $40, the few issues are easily forgotten. Had I paid the full $60 AAA price, I'd still be as happy. If the devs keep adding as they've stated, that $40 is going to look like even more of a steal. Run, don't walk, to add this to your collection.",5,2,0,888,3894,94,1297,41,11,61.29,10.09,8.62,12.9
"Now this is how a developer makes a great first game!!!! Lets kick things off by saying, this game is hard.... and I dont mean dark souls hard, I mean pray that your teammates have mics and do as you say or no one will survive a second. Teamwork is the key word for this game! If you dont communicate you wont survive. The game is on and offline, but its better to play with others. Boards of zombies literally flood your screen! Its amazing to see all this in a single frame without stuttering or glitching! This made me believe in miracles!!!! Weapons are customizable as well as character perks and they all serve a purpose!

Also has multiplayer modes such as swarm deathmatch and domination, where human squads fight each other while zombie hordes get in the mix. Currently the main downfall I have experienced is the intelligence of the other players when playing offline and allowing the programming to play with you. This has been addressed by the creators and should be patched and updated shortly, as well as new levels and character additions. For the $40 price it is well worth it, and honestly could have been a $60 game initially in my opinion.",5,2,0,122,576,17,187,6,11,56.52,10.43,10.51,13.71

"Every year I fight with the question of which soccer title to purchase and every year I end up purchasing both PES and FIFA. Truth be told, I usually end up playing FIFA more than PES. That deciding factor has always come down to licensing and presentation, because both titles play well. Well, that being said, FIFA again has cornered the market on the licensing, by snatching up the Champions League and also upping the ante in the presentation department. However this year, the gameplay for me feels broken. I have had several instances where goals were scored by way of animations playing out that I had no control over. Madden Football has become notorious for this and now it appears to have spilled over to FIFA. This is not a good thing at all. I can give you several examples of this, but the we don't have enough time. Here is one example. The opposing team took a shot on goal and it deflected off my defender and looked good while doing so, ball physics and all. And then IT happened.....The other offensive player literally slid about 5 yards over, like on ice skates, to put himself in the perfect spot to net the goal, without the players head even tracking the ball or legs moving to run over to that spot. The play happened so fast I had to watch the replay to figure out how it was possible that the player reacted so insanely fast. And that is when I noticed that it wasn't anyone reacting or controlling the player at all, it was in fact a pre-determined animation playing out. WOW!! What a buzz kill...Up to this point, I had never witnessed this occurring in a FIFA title. It is supremely disappointing and frustrating. That was only the first occurrence of many. I have also noticed a crazy amount of players clipping through other players, the ground and their own limbs as well. It just really feels as though the FIFA development team is banking on the licensing and presentation to carry this game and have left the gameplay unfinished and broken. It's an easy decision this year for me. It's PES all the way. FIFA will be in real trouble if PES can improve on the presentation and licenses, because when it comes to realism on the Pitch....it's hands down PES.

Vanquish is a third person over the shoulder style game and is very fast and fun, I can guarantee every one can enjoy Vanquish if given a chance. As far as the collection it's bare bones and that don't bother me, what does knock a star off is the fact that the game is advertised as native 4k when it is not. Neither the one x or the ps4 pro run this game in 4k natively, regardless it looks far better than the original release and runs very smooth.",4,1,0,111,438,8,148,4,12,65.87,10.97,6.34,13.98

"First let me say that I am not one of these young game players who live, breath and die by gaming. I am 63 year old female who happens to love gaming. I bought the Orange Box as one of my first X-Box games and got hooked on Valve. Portal was right down my alley. Portal 2 for me rocks beyond belief. I am at chapter 4 which is where the dificulty level kicks in. Portal 2 has many upgrades to Portal. The controls are better and more responsive and situated better. I love the diverse methods of beams, light floors, new cubes etc. to assist you in your getting from one place to the next. I could go on forever about the creative imagery and totally fantastic visual effects. Just go buy the game and enjoy it for what it is. Puzzle game playing at its best.",5,37,2,149,595,10,203,13,4,79.94,4.96,5.1,7.27

It has some expected but still surprising twists and turns along the way as well. I spent hours on several levels trying to reason out the solutions and once I figured it out it was very satisfying! If you enjoyed the first Portal and you like first person style games I think you will enjoy this a great deal. Valve did a great job!!!",5,24,1,104,414,7,134,7,5,82.75,5.41,5.61,8.64

"Portal 2 is a mind-bending puzzle game from Valve. You open your mind to a knew way of gaming. You get a portal manipulator device, which you use to create 2 separate rifts in space and time to teleport throughout the map. You essentially just go in one portal, and go out the other. This device along with useful environmental advantages will help you conquer dozens of maps and will have you thinking with portals. Portal 2 is a blend of puzzle game and first person action that will keep you, and now a friend, busy for a while. Maybe there will be Cake this time?",5,21,4,107,450,6,150,7,7,72.72,6.91,6.99,8.36

Have yet to explore the co-op section but I am sure it is just as good. The graphics are great and the story line is good as well. No gun or fighting violence and no mindless cursing and foul lanuage. Your adveserary is a compute AI that is trying to kill you but the violence is mild if not almost non existent. Great game for casual gamers.",5,13,1,96,384,8,128,7,5,80.12,5.49,5.56,8.82
"Wow. The amazing storyline will keep you playing for hours. After playing this you will be looking for places to put portals in real life! What really is the fantastic humor and voice acting. Crazy, babbling Wheatley, is by far the best video game character ever with the best voice acting ever. GLaDOS isn't far behind. A fun game where you think, not just blow peoples brains out with machine guns. The co-op doesn't disappoint either.",5,8,0,79,348,7,114,8,5,74.73,5.29,7.1,7.49
"Portal 2 honestly has to be one of the best games i have ever played in my life. I played almost ever kind of xbox game imaginable but this game definately has a different vibe. Running around shooting at ever thing that moves in COD or HALO gets pretty boring. But Portal 2 is a great way to sit back, have fun and work your brain at the same time.

"I was a big fan of the original Portal, so I had to give this a try. I had much debate over whether or not to spend $60 on the game because I knew how much use I would get out of it. Anyway, long story short, I bought it, beat it within two days, and haven't picked it up since. I'm told I should play the multi-player mode, I just don't wanna! Can't imagine having to play this game with some tard who keeps messing around and getting killed. The game was fun and had some great challenges. I really enjoyed it........ for 2 days..... You want my opinion? Rent it....",4,13,8,117,421,6,147,10,2,88.67,3.8,2.83,6.73
"Portal 2 was a real treat to play. The puzzles are thought-provoking and deceptively tricky. The addition of 'goo' adds a nice dimension to the puzzles - and the addition of a co-op mode really pushed this title over the top. Only a couple of the puzzles were stumpers which makes the game approachable to even the most logically challenged. Even those few that offered a challenge garnered 'Aha' moments once the solution was realized. So, while none of the puzzles induced headaches, the entire game was well worth the cost - its more than just a puzzle game, afterall, any time spent with GLaDOS is worth falling down a few pits, getting crushed by large spikey articulated platforms, covered by orange, blue and white goo and suffering verbal abuse, isn't it?",5,6,2,133,609,15,201,6,12,56.48,10.89,9.79,13.38
"Here's a game you can play with the whole family as you try to solve the more challenging puzzles presented. The Humor of the compute opponent is frankly a great surprise. I play this with my 11 year old daughter - we have fun in co-op mode and assisting each other while we play individually.",5,3,0,56,233,6,78,3,8,70.05,8.13,7.08,11.75
"Portal 2 is awesome and different that your run of the mill First Person Shooters. It's 10,000 years in the future, mankind has perished...all that's left is machines. You are a robot trapped inside a complex run by a maniacal super-computer with a bad attitude. You have a portal gun that allows you to create entrance/exit portals, and you are given puzzles to solve in order to proceed from one level to the next in the game. Some of the puzzles are simple to solve, others are quite elaborate. This is a great game, no violence, just problem solving. Highly recommended.",5,3,0,107,454,9,156,8,6,69.92,6.83,6.94,8.71
"In case you haven't been told recently or often enough, this really is one of the greatest ever invented. If you're a fan of the first-person shooter but miss the old days of puzzle games, this is the most satisfying game I've played in a long time. And it's hilarious. The commentary you get from GLAdOS, Wheatley, and Cave Johnson have you frequently laughing out loud as you stretch your brain to figure out the puzzles. It's just challenging enough to make you feel smart as you complete most levels. Hours of playtime, absolute replay value, and engaging co-op missions earn this game my highest recommendation.",5,2,0,113,492,12,163,6,9,65.69,8.78,8.23,11.78

This game was 4 years in the making, and you can tell with the level of detail in the story, equipment, shards (powers), and graphic. There are little nuggets that nod to horror genres of all kind, and of course to past Castlevania games. The visual fidelity on the XBox One X in 4K is the best I've seen yet. I also have it on the PS4 Pro 4K, and on the same UHD screen, I am able to get better clarity on the Xbox One X version. Either way, whatever platform you are on, Bloodstained is a fantastic game with hours and hours to continue to explore!

Some time in the last week Wargaming changed the amount of gold the card gives you for $25,00, reducing it to 5,350 gold or 214 gold per dollar. Not such a great deal, one of the worst in fact.

It uses what used to be called poor-mans scrolling (move a few steps, load, move a few steps, load), and the most awful environment interaction I think Ive ever used. My CDi has more control. If youre thinking about picking this up because you think it would be the perfect game to bring a casual gamer into the VR world (like I did, hoping my wife would enjoy it), you might as well put the 5 bucks towards a tent youll be sleeping in in the back yard.

"Paranormal Activity for PSVR is a fairly short game, but the price makes up for it. I'm a fan of horror games, and was hopeful that this would at the very least, offer a creepy atmosphere to explore in VR. This has actually ended up being one of my favorite experiences on the PSVR. The game is creepy, the controls work really well, and aside from some initial tracking issues, the game has been a joy to play. Initially I had trouble picking items up off of the ground. Once I moved my camera higher and stepped back a couple of steps, that took care of the tracking issues I faced at first, and tracking has been spot on since. I also realized that in order to pick up some items, you have to use the crouch button to reach low enough. Overall, this is a great creepy game, with lots of atmosphere. There aren't really any difficult puzzles in the game, but you do have to do a good job of exploring to find what you need to progress. If you like eerie atmospheres and exploration, I'd recommend buying Paranormal Activity.",4,2,0,195,809,21,281,10,8,65.13,9.02,7.08,12.11

"Very buggy game with enemy markers not always working, enemies walking off cliffs or building edges, distracting enemies with rock does not work some of the time. Just full of things you would expect a game developer to be better at. Every time you go to the main menu and then go back to continue the mission, you have to listen to about the entire intro before you can start. Earned enough money to upgrade weapon, but then upgrades aren't on weapon, even though it says equipped; and going back to the main menu to double-check that it was equipped forced me to listen to the mission intro all over again. How about this for stupidity from the developers, for targeting when throwing a rock, grenade, etc. they use the color white as the target radius and aim point and several missions are in snow. so you can't see where you're throwing it. How stupid is that why not make it a bright yellow or orange? I guess this will finally teach me a lesson about pre-ordering a game. Need to let it be out for several weeks and read the reviews.

"Though this game will be available on XBOX Gamepass, I wanted to own the physical copy as I do nearly all my titles as a collector. This game visually is stunning. Its very intense and is not for children. Its about a Viking warrior dealing with her loved ones passing. The combat is not as frequent as I expected. Which isnt a bad thing. Its atory based driven. There are however plenty of puzzles. I for one didnt have the patience so I YouTube most of them. The game is a satisfying action adventure. If you like puzzles its definitely for you.

"I dont know why people keep bashing this game , it plays just like COD 4 . the weapons are WW2 weapons but what did you expect with a WW2 game. there are plenty of weapons to choose from you just have to unlock them making it that more challenging. some people say that you start out with junk weapons but that is definately not true and you unlock the MP40 after being promoted after the first few promotions which is one of the best weapons , the next to unlock is the type 100 which is another fast shooting great weapon. people are also grumbling about the tanks because they say they are nearly indestructible which is of course not true. All you have to do is shoot it twice with a rocket launcher amd then a grenade and it is destroyed. this is true 99% of the time. I mean what did you expect ,it is a tank and its not supposed to be killed with a few shots from your gun or a grenade or two , it doesnt happen in real life why should it happen in the game. people also gripe about some of the boards being to dark and bad graphics. look all you have to do is go into the options in the game and go to brightness and turn it up all the way and it will be plenty bright enough ( I guarantee the people that say it is to dark never tried this). and talking about the graphics , the graphics on the game are great people that dont like the game are just trying to find more reasons to bash the game. the artillary strikes you get after 5 streight kills is just awsome much beltter than the air strikes on COD 4 , they are just devastating to an enemy if plced right. all you have to do is wait for one of your teamates to get a recon plane so you can see where the enemy is and then pumel them with your artillary strikes. after 7 streight kills you get to call the dogs to action and this is another great additive . call your dogs and follow them and they will lead you and your teamates to the enemy plus giving you extra kills like the helecopter on COD4. people also say the dogs are nearly indestructibe and this is also not true , you can either shoot them or if you don't want to give your position away kill them with your knife, its that simple , but learn to time your knife attack right or they will kill you , but it only takes a few times to get the hang of it. the boards are also just awsome, they are alot bigger than COD4 giving you more places to hide and move around in stealth to find the enemy. also in march treyarch the creator of the game is coming out with new map packs to download so you will have more boards to play on. ( I CAN'T HARDLY WAIT !!!!!!!!!!! ) . all I can say is that this is a great game and one that I can't wait to get home to play after I get home from work. I will not bash COD 4 because I own this one also and have enjoyed this game for many hours and still play it with my friends, we tend to alternate between the two but COD5 is my favorite. so if you buy this game and I think you should dont give up on it after the first few minutes because the more you play the better it gets , and believe me it is great. for the people that keep posting negative junk they either are not any good at the game or dont have the patience to unlock the better weapons on the game and think it should be handed to them like on COD4 . so dont listen to the negative junk and try it yourself buy it or rent it it doesnt matter you wont be disappointed. what I have just said in this review is based mostly on the online multiplayer part of this game but dont get me wrong the campaign is also one of the best.",5,2,0,709,2770,30,890,26,11,72.96,9.86,6.09,12.6
"A good sequel for COD and first shooter fans. World at War mimics the rewards and rank-up benefits methodology of COD4. The one down note, Activision contracted Treyarch instead of the more highly skilled Infinity Ward to produce this game, and as a result some detail and authenticity suffers. Regardless of which side you fight on, the uniforms all look like wrinkly green G.I. Joe. Contrasting with the brilliant authenticity of Infinity Ward's CODs 2 and 4 this is quite a disappointment. When you're playing the only way to tell friend from foe is the name tag popping up above the character, green letters for friend, red letters for foe. Sometimes this doesn't appear in time to make a crucial decision. Contrasting the uniforms Russian v. German or Japanese v. American would be a great improvement for this game and bring it up closer on par with CODs 2 and 4.",4,2,0,156,698,19,229,12,7,69.45,6.8,8.23,10.07
"Look, for everyone bagging on the game before it's even come out, get a grip. Have you ever played any of the old school CoD games? Call of Duty 1 and it's expansion pack United Offensive laid the groundwork for what a CoD game should be. UO had vehicles, huge maps, and new weapons. Between UO and CoD2, UO had the better game engine as far as physics and hit detection. CoD2 was a good game, but it got rid of two things UO had gotten right: sprint and vehicles. CoD3 was alright, it was poorly implemented. CoD4 is probably the best game in the series to date. Best campaign I've played, most diverse multiplayer I've played. CoD5 is just going back to the roots of Call of Duty. How can you complain about being able to n00b it up with a flamethrower, or vehicle camp/spam like none other? It adds a new, challenging dimension to the game and I honestly can't believe why people are knocking on it. Since it's using the CoD4 engine, it's basically a full conversion mod for Modern Warfare. It also covers a theater of WWII CoD hasn't touched yet. Bottom line: New perks + new weapons + 4 player co-op + new gameplay + new storyline + vehicles + game engine that's seen successful action = Game of the year shoo-in and NO reason to be complaining about it.",5,3,1,240,978,23,330,15,6,74.27,6.88,6.31,10.23

"COD:Waw is the better pick of the two. People that say COD:4 is better are probably sniping someone right now because they are scared of a little action. I'll admit that the spawning system in Waw is flawed and a sometimes you are spawn killed. DRINK WATER! The only reason that is happening is because someone on the opposing team is pressing the action and kicking your teams butt! It is good to make some friends that regularly play this game and that you can rely on to have your back. That way you are never playing with a bunch of nublets and 10 year olds that are more worried about sniping and shooting nub tubes. You have to learn what perks and weapons work best with what maps. That is why the prestige system is so much better. The more classes you can create, the more options you have to switch to mid-match. But if you are playing by yourself, they have mercenary match options where there are no parties allowed. COD:Waw keeps the pace going in each match. Rewards for kills are also alot better in this game becasue there are few places you can hide from a pack of dogs. Nub snipers never win in this game, if you're team has more than 1 or 2 snipers, get out of there because you are about to get beat!",5,1,0,237,966,6,304,14,7,81.14,6.15,6.42,7.78

You will put days and days worth of hours on your system with this game because of its replay value. I play probably close to 2 hours every night sometimes more. The campaign on the game is also excellent and as good as any other game I have played through. The only bad which really isn't so negative is the weapons. They are spot on for the timeline but I enjoy the weapons on call of duty modern warfare more. Anyway, this game is a must have if you haven't already picked up a copy and xbox 360 is definitely the system to play it on.",5,1,0,134,529,8,181,7,7,73.13,7.81,5.87,10.05

Multiplayer is basically garbage....weapons/perks are WAYYYY too cheap....I swear the levels were made for players who have to play cheaply! in other words before you buy it, ask a friend to borrow it first, i still think CoD4 is better.",4,1,0,97,398,7,131,9,4,81.64,4.55,5.58,7.2
"Reader should know that I have played a very limited amount of COD 4, and have never played a WW II game. Up until now, my favorite shooting game is Gears 2. Having said that, I was very pleasantly surprised by WAW. The graphics was amazing, the campaign really puts you in the middle of the action, you will feel like you are fighting more for yourself and your country. The AI are not as sharp as the ones in COD 4, but hey, that means more kills for me. One upside it has from COD 4 is that you can play co-op in the campaign (up to 4 players), that will definitely come in handy for the veteran level. However the weapon choice isn't as fancy as its predecessor, basically there is a rifle (one bullet at a time), a machine gun (multiple bullets with one click), and flamethrower. Perhaps there will be more selections later on in the game. I haven't explored the online play too much, so I cannot really give an opinion on it. This game probably isn't worth $60, if you have that much to spend, I'll recommend Gears 2, but when you can buy it for $35, it's definitely a good deal! I would recommend this to anyone, and hope you can get it before the end of this week for the deep discount.",5,1,0,236,923,21,316,11,8,71.78,8.58,5.82,12.14
"The multiplayer of this game is pretty cool, but if you've played COD4, you'll want to go back. The two worst things about this game by far are your AI teammates and the enemy grenade spam. I'm not kidding about either of these; it is the most annoying thing in any video game. The teammates are COMPLETELY useless. Okay, they do occasionally take out a guy, but I've had COUNTLESS times where I run up, then get shot by an enemy next to me or behind me; BUT the worst thing is that my teammate is standing RIGHT NEXT to the enemy, and doesn't do anything. Grenade spams in this game are like no other. You are prone (or crouched, doesn't matter) behind a box or trench, then one by one (or three by three,) grenades start POURING on top of you. If you're playing on veteran, you get shot if you try to run away; so you just start tappin' the right bumper as fast as you can, hoping to get every grenade out of your face. The enemies really don't care about your teammates (neither should you) and start chucking the grenades RIGHT at you (right is capitalized because they hit your face, then bounce to the ground because the enemies have such good arms) I decided to say i would reccomend this because, it still has good gameplay during multiplayer, but, i would reccomend it to them in the future, because this game is NOT worth $60. You don't feel immersed in the game; You feel like you're playing a video game (funny). If you want to hear about some bad stuff in multiplayer, there's a few topics. One of the good things is that they've fixed the spawning problems (MOST of the time) where you spawn next to an enemy a lot. But, i played an entire round with only two kills, because I couldn't find anybody. That's just boring, spending a whole round LOOKING for enemies, and not killing enemies. One of the worst aspects of CODWAW is the (multiplayer) tanks! they're so annoying! the bazooka is useless (it might be better if using the extra explosion damage perk, i dunno), because it takes about FIVE bazookas to kill one tank. Seriously. and you only spawn with two. So, in short, it might be a good game for christmas, but maybe next christmas when the price goes down. And you may think, 'how could the mess up COD that bad? it cant be THAT bad.' But it is that bad. If you don't have COD4, get it before you get this. You'll be happy you did.",3,1,0,458,1821,37,603,25,7,76.86,7.09,5.96,10.56
"This games only good thing is STory mode. THe online play is not realistic as soon as you spawn you get killed which is bad spawn placement. The Perk system is still active in this game, They need to get rid of the Perk system and this game would be much better but the run-in part of the game would be there. Too me this game and COD4 both present a Military based Halo game where u run in and shoot it up. Games are getting away from tactics and going more towards run and gunners. If you are a fan of the Story and like this kind of gameplay with a perk system to cheapen the experience and dying every 4 seconds then buy it. But if you like tactics and want to play realistic shooters go to Rainbow six:Vegas 1 until another Rainbow Six title comes out.",3,2,1,151,599,6,196,7,9,75.13,8.14,6.15,10.22
"It has a very fun, and difficult campaign, with good graphics. Its online fixed a lot of things, a few of them are: now its 'Juggernaut' is not as stupid. Instead of helicopters they have dogs that you can easily kill. Also, now when you get ripped off a kill, it doesn't just give you 2 points, now it gives you hoever many points you deserve from weakening the person The only thing I don't like about the Online Play is the little bombs that replaced the claymores. Unless you have the enemy explosive seeing perk on, you can rarely see them. So, overall it is a great game, and I give it a 9.4 out of 10",5,1,0,121,470,9,161,7,6,76.72,6.85,5.33,9.89

That's so dumb, that means, this game will just be all camping, and whoever see's the other person first gets the kill. This means its a no-skill game, and not worth paying for. I don't know how many people play with their volume up on their tv, obviously most, but your not going to want to with this game. Every few seconds their will be screeching and VERY ANNOYING mortars. You can also expect to get spawn-killed, over and over and over, another thing they didn't correct when I am sure its possible to correct, if only they would spawn you in a safe area. Another thing that's stupid about it is, theirs no more helicopter when you get 5 kills in a row, instead, you just gain the ability to release dogs, that more then half the time don't even attack anyone, they run in circles and glitch to walls. The makers of this game really embarrassed themselves with this one, don't know why people are rating it good, maybe they haven't played the beta yet.

"This game was very disappointing to me. I got the game the very first day it came out because it had so much hype. The game was amazing at first but a couple hours of playing it got me disappointed. The bad things about the game are the maps. All the maps are huge and have no detail at all. On cod4 the maps were small and able to go to places without taking a breath. Also i surprised the game went back to WW2. I mean the maps are so bad and thats the main reason it was a failure. Also the guns are terrible and sniping was awful. If you thought this game was gonna be even half as good as COD4 then you thought wrong. So if you want a good buy then stay with HALO 3 because a lot of people have that. Also COD4 is a waste now because no one gets on it no more.

COD 4 was great a year ago, but it's a year later now and with COD World at War staying with last year's technology and going with OLDER WW2 weapons, it's just not as exciting as other current shooters. It only took me 8 hours to make it through the campaign and it was a grind because it has scripted A.I. spawning in the same places doing the same thing. FarCry 2 has UNSCRIPTED A.I. which means you never know what they are going to do, for example one time I snuck up on a enemy going to the bathroom in the woods and knifed him in the back. With FarCry 2's map editor giving you unlimited maps to play on, an 80 HOUR CAMPAIGN WITH UNSCRIPTED A.I. and the best graphics on any console, I just can't recommend spending money on COD World at War when there are much better games on the market.",2,0,3,199,764,11,262,11,6,77.09,7,5.14,9.45

They used many of the great things from modern warfare, such as weapon customization and prestige modes, but still failed to reach the same height. The online system was simply not very enjoyable. Guns lack the power to give you any satisfaction while you firing them as well as having almost no recoil. This results in a very unbalanced weapons system. Spawning was focused more on team spawns rather than safe spawns, I cannot count the times I spawned and died by crossfire. Overall, treyarch did not deliver as infinity ward did. The only aspect of the game that kept me going in the campaign was the prospect of Zombies which delivered and was ten times more fun than the campaign itself and most of the online play combined. All in all, If you are looking for a good online first person shooter buy CoD Modern Warfare or Halo3 rather than this game.",2,0,1,171,759,11,243,9,9,67.33,8.59,8.74,10.17

Game play flowed ok online it was frustrating when someone would run by me i would shoot them point blank range but they would kill me, on the kill cam my bullets would fly to the left and right of the person.......very frustrating. Worst of all for the different game modes you don't level up different for each category, i leveled up to 40 and tried to play some different categories like lone wolves and capture the flag i had to play with people my level even though i hadnt played that.

"To me, this is one of the most exciting franchises to hit the Xbox 360 console. Call of Duty 2 was where it all started for me. I remember that was before I even had an Xbox and i was stuck playing on the computer. I didn't know what to expect when I began playing but I was hooked almost instantly by it's action and heart pounding intensity. The reason I'm refering to Call of Duty 2 is because this new Call of Duty: World at War will take place in World War II. I've read alot of complaints about that fact, but I cannot be more excited. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was in my opinion the best Call of Duty title to date, and the game engine used in that will be the same engine you see in Call of Duty: World at War. I've seen gameplay on this new thrilling title, and for the first time in any Call of Duty game there will be weapons in which you will never get bored with. Take for instance, the flamethrower! Yes, I said it, a flamethrower will be present in this amazing title. I watched a gameplay vid on this flamethrower, and I was impressed. This guy, torches a field and burns up a tree while soliders run around on fire dying, screaming, it's complete brilliance. The AI looks so intelligent it's disgusting. I couldn't take it all in immediately. They move like you and I. They hide, they ambush, they flank. I'm sure if you watch the gameplay videos you will be more impressed than my short and unsatasfying review. Please, I urge you to get this game. If you are going to spend $350,00 on a console, you might as well get the best it has to offer. Read my review on Fallout 3 as well.

It is an open-world space saga that features modular toy technology that let the players assemble and customize real-world physical starships, link the starships to their game controller, and launch into an epic adventure across the Atlas star system. The game has awesome graphics and many things to do with the game. With the real life pieces (weapons kit, pilot kit, space ship, etc) its fun to create your dream ship. If your kids have a Nintendo Switch, it has an exclusive feature.

Mix and match weapons, pilots, and starships and watch the seamless transition happen in-game.

"First of all, this game is a love letter to Shenmue fans that have been waiting for almost two decades, however those people have already purchased the game so my quick review wont be focused on them. I know this game has gotten interest from people that may not have played or known about this series until recently. I strongly advise those people to play Shenmue I & II first before jumping into this game, that collection is available on PS4, Xbox and PC for a very affordable price, also included in Xbox Game Pass. Shenmue is a game thats fairly hard to describe how unique and groundbreaking it was unless you were there to experience it back twenty years ago, when the gaming industry was smaller and still growing into the giant it is today. Just play those and experience it for yourself. Shenmue is one of my favorite games because of how charming and immersive the world is, however I understand completely if some people dont like this type of game. However, if you enjoy those first two games (which is great!), then I would suggest playing Shenmue III.",4,2,0,190,856,20,279,8,12,58.5,11,9.44,13.71
"Here are the pros and cons that I felt after played it for over 20 hours: Pros: 1. The game gives the player(especially the series fan) a genuine Shenmue experience. 2. The world the game created is is full of details. If you are a patient player which accept a leisure style of playing, you might encounter many surprises during the exploration of the world. If you are an old gamer from the 1990s, you might even find yourself addicted to some of the mini-games in the world..... 3. Shenmue 3 is also a journey of improving one's body and soul, recommended for those players that are interested in KongFu or Asian culture. Cons: 1. The graphics of the game feels like in PS3 standard, which might prevent some players of the new console generation to pick it up. 2. The story of Shenmue 3 doesn't progress much. Since Suzuki has mentioned before that the Shenmue story has 11 chapters, I guess it would take at least two more games to finish the story while Suzuki is already 61..... To sum up, as a player, one definitely have the right to criticize Shenmue 3's outdated graphics and lack of some modern open-world game features(like in Assassin Creed, GTA V, etc), but do remember that this is NOT a AAA game and the funding for Shenmue 3 is limited. So here I rated the game from a kickstarter game perspective, and I think in this perspective, Shenmue 3 does live up to the expectations of most of the series fans by providing a genuine Shenmue experience. PS: Suppose one is asked to rate the three games which come out recently: Death Stranding(abbreviated as 'DS'), Pokemon Sword and Shield(as 'PokeSS) and Shenmue 3(as 'Sh3'). A hard core gamer might rate them as follows: DS: 9/10, PokeSS: 7/10, Sh3: 8/10. A serious game media might rate them as follows: DS: 6/10, PokeSS: 4/10, Sh3: 5/10. A 'generous' game media might rate them as follows: DS: 9/10, PokeSS: 10/10, Sh3: 9/10. I believe for a normal person or game media, the rating standard for games should be consistent. Guess how IGN's ratings for the three games are? It turns out to be as follows: DS: 6.8/10 PokeSS: 9.3/10 Sh3: 5.9/10 It's so inconsistent and almost felt like it was rated by a lunatic to me. How shameful!",5,2,0,420,1690,38,584,26,6,72.8,7.12,6.03,10.08

"I have been waiting for this sequel since 2002 when I first beat Shenmue II on the original Xbox. It is everything I wanted and then some. Thank you to everyone involved and on to #SaveShenmueIV!

"I'm a long time Shenmue fan. When the kickstarter was announced a while back it was one of the best moments in gaming for me. But those the game live up to all that hype? It's a yes and no kind of thing here. Long time shenmue fans will love this game because the core feel and atmosphere is there. But the story in this one leaves a lot to be desired. Feels like we get only a small bit of the story and they could have fleshed it out more. All in all, it's a decent game, doesn't outdo the previous games for me but I still very much enjoyed everything this game had to offer.",5,1,0,121,448,5,147,8,4,88.7,4.64,4.01,7.7
"This game is trash, its all built around nostalgia with hopes of blinding your realistic expectations of what a modern game in 2019 should be. It plays like and looks like Shenmue 2 on the PS4, there are mobile games that look way better than this and probably didn't cost close to how much kickstarter funds this raised. I'm honestly questioning how all that funding was spent developing this. You would think being the third installment of a franchise and the amount of time in between there would be significant improvements, nope, its like they had this game made already 18 years ago, put a $5 suit on it and sent it out the door to prom. The voice acting is horrid, and if your argument is that's how the originals are, or that's how Shenmue games are suppose to be, you should really raise your expectations. I consider God of War to be a masterpiece and one of the best games I've ever played, and when it was $60 it was worth every penny of that price tag. Shenmue 3, isn't worth more than $9,99 in the bargain bin.",1,3,2,197,808,18,261,7,12,66.19,11.02,7.27,14.91

"I've been a huge fan of borderlands since the first game and I have to say that borderlands 3 did not live up to the hype. There is entirely too much language in this game. Way more than borderlands 2. I'm only on level 19 and I've noticed way more language and sexual innuendos. I also don't like the emphasis of space in the game. This is what most people did not like about borderlands the pre sequel. The graphics honestly are nothing to write home about. They look very cartoonish. I prefer the borderlands 2 graphics. Couch co-op is a pain to play because the quest only shows up on the player 1 screen and not on player 2 screen.

"It's alright. It's fun. It's fine. What more do you want from me? A f#%*ing neck rub? If you're just wondering if it's worth getting; it is. If you want to know why it's good as well as Dark Souls in general, then read on. I like difficult games. I was able to finish Ninja Gaiden II for the Xbox 360 on Mentor difficulty. One of my best achievements. If you call achievements sitting on your butt playing video games instead of going out and curing cancer. Or something. Ninja Gaiden II is hard but more for the cheap tactics the enemies do to you, the player. I had avoided Dark Souls because I didn't want another time sink of games considered hard for the wrong reasons like Ninja Gaiden II. A year ago I popped in Bloodborne which I got from Christmas of 2015 (It's from the same developers do it's literally the games as Dark Souls). And I liked it. Soon I got the other Dark Souls games. This was the last on my list. Now to go to my point: IT'S NOT AS HARD AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS! These games still are tough as nails. They'll pile drive you into the ground time after time because you can keep coming back. But in reality, persistence is the key here. NOT SKILL. This game is more fair in its deaths than Ninja Gaiden II without a doubt. People on the internet say it's always fair... BULLSH*T! A fair game doesn't require you to use cheap tactics to win. Which you WILL have to do at one point or another. 'What do you know? You're just one player! Git gud! lol' If that's what you're thinking, why are you reading Best Buy reviews? Second, if you're saying this you probably already own this or watch other people play it. And third: I consider myself an expert on the subject of cheap game design. Ninja Gaiden II: -Unblockable explosive shuriken that stuns you when you're hit and the only way to not get badly hurt is to abuse invincibility frames -Enemies at the top of a tall ladder that can knock you back and kill you instantly -enemies that attack you when you're climbing across a rope with no way to attack or dodge -bosses with high damage outputs and fast wind-ups for strong attacks along with attacks that can easily break guards and have attack range further than you can dodge Dark Souls and Bloodborne -Game is not meant to take on multiple opponents at once because you get blindsided by an enemy you couldn't know was there. You have to usually get one's attention and repeat the process -boss attacks that one-shot you and require you to die over and over to understand their move set. -Nonlinear nature of the games can sometimes bring you to enemies that wipe the floor with you without possibly knowing prior -attacks that have further reach than you can dodge Both have many other instances of cheapness. Regardless, Dark Souls is a fun game series and worth your time. You will die a lot. Dying is the only way you can get some achievements/trophies! Perservere.

"I'm someone who was never interested in demon souls/ dark souls games after trying them as they were a bit too slow and clunky for me. I decided to try bloodborne which I thought was a masterpiece because it was unique, fluid and always left me wanted to play more. I decided to try dark souls 3 and it isn't a bad game to me but it just doesn't have the same appeal as bloodborne. Dark souls 3 was beautiful but doesn't have the atmosphere and interesting lore that bloodborne has and the gameplay mechanics isn't as good. Also, not to mention that the first 5 or so bosses I fought were extremely easy compared to bloodborne. I also thought the gun parrying and transforming weapons was amazing and the change that bloodborne brought to souls series inspired dark souls to change the flow of ds3. To me going from bloodborne to ds3 is like going from a 5 star hotel to a 3 star hotel. A 3 star hotel isn't bad but with a choice, i'd rather stick with the 5",3,1,2,189,759,18,255,8,10,68.71,9.54,6.56,13.26

"This is my second souls game after Bloodborne and I'm slightly underwhelmed. The camera angles seem to be even worse, if that's possible and the frame rate is awful in certain areas. There is input lag when rolling and you can die due to these issues when a fat enemy pins you into a corner and the camera goes bonkers. Target lock on is more trouble than it's worth. Weapons of the same type will generally have the same moveset as each other. Katanas are boring to use. Greatswords are too slow and cumbersome. Straight swords are the most effective but also boring. Sorcery is too weak. Pyromancy has a lot of useless and similar spells but is probably more viable than sorcery. The story is confusing and makes no sense. The combat in general is nowhere near Dragon's Dogma level. This would probably be a good game to co-op, and unless you like PVP or self-torture you would find more frustration than satisfaction when gaming alone.",3,2,4,173,751,23,256,13,6,68.14,7.06,7.5,10.64

I would like to think I'm an expert gamer 'BO3' but this game made me feel like i had never played before. Took me forever to get passed the first boss and by that time i finally did.. i was over it. allllll dodging.. I would give this game a 1 star in my personal opinion.

So basically the maps dont need to be large and there is no story its just a RPG locked on Extreme difficulty. It takes so long to progress you forget the story line and mechanics are a joke. The only defense that works is the roll away and that dos not even work I got 3 hours in this piece of garbage and I am only pass the first mission. I will never buy another Souls Game I will stick to Skyrim and other franchises where the developers understand there are people like me that work all day, come home and just want to relax play a good game with a story that dos not raze my blood pressure to the point this game does.

The ol' Batman trope of dying the hero or living long enough to become the villain has been done, again and again... It seems more and more like Blizzard doesn't care what their players think, as long as they continue to make money. Unfortunately they seem to be applying free-to-play elements to a game that is not only buy-to-play, but also has a subscription fee. I understand wanting to extend content so your players need more in-game time to finish things, but Blizzard likes to double dip. So I'm gonna go ahead and not recommend this one - yet. I think it's going to take several more months for them to bake out enough changes to make the community happy. Maybe then it'll deserve a look.

This remastered version that was base on the PS2 as well as it did get a Nintendo DS release, for a rating that is E10+ this game should not be for younger viewers, and should be more for adults as a M Ratting.

"ith most of the Mario titles in the past decade, I've always been disappointed to smash my way through them in under a week without having faced any real difficulty at any point in the game. Mario 3D Land turns this on its head at the last minute. Upon defeating Bowser at the end of your standard round of 8 worlds, the game unlocks a new character and a new set of 8 more worlds that are all exceptionally challenging. The second set of worlds gets *NINTENDO HARD* at some points, and even the most experienced player will find themselves burning through dozens of lives on the same stage. The main difference is that there's no real punishment for failure because extra lives are near-unlimited and ridiculously easy to come by. Despite that, at the end of the day the sudden uptick in difficulty is just one of the many ways that Mario 3D Land honors and makes references to its roots. It borrows powerups, stages, tropes, enemies, and music from all throughout the series and ultimately makes this into one that was meant to appeal to the most longtime of fans.",5,1,0,195,855,18,284,7,14,55.35,12.46,8.92,14.84

I've also had small (non-game breaking) bugs while playing: Visiting Sims get locked into playing Chess and wont leave, pressing X sometimes don't bring up the action menu and I'm still not sure if my hired gardener is still hired after I turn off the game. Besides those little annoyances, the game is even more intricate than previous Sims games. There's so much to do, many more aspirations and life goals, playing different instruments, careers branch off into 2/3 paths that lead to different end jobs. Once you spend some time familiarizing yourself with the controls, the game goes much more smoothly.",4,1,0,151,635,12,202,6,11,68.12,10.01,7.75,13.25

There are some minor issues: The game does stall a little but when I switch form live mode to build mode.

"I will definitely try to keep this basic and spoiler free! I have played the original Catherine on PS3 back in 2011 and absolutely LOVED it! Had no idea what I was getting myself into, but never would've thought 'a love horror story and puzzle game' hybrid would make for hours of fun! I'm just over halfway through my Full Body run and I can say: - Replayability should be decent as there are two ways to 'play' the puzzles: Remix and Classic. It basically just changes the shapes of the blocks you pull (reminds me of Tetris pieces) but it did make things a tad more tricky - It's been so long since I've played through this that I can't easily point out the 'change and additions' they made to the story (with the exception of adding Rin, obviously) - The graphics are about what you would've expected on the PS3 version - I did notice several cut scenes that I didn't at all remember from before - The puzzle sequences are solid, smooth, and challenging as ever - Can't remember if there was a online multiplayer mode on PS3 or not, but there is now - They added a bunch of endings to this version as well - I'm just as hooked as I was 8 years ago playing this! I will definitely be going through once choosing all the 'douchy' answers and again being the 'nice guy' lol The worst part of the game is having to talk to all the sheep in between puzzle 'stages' - however, I'm only doing it on my first play-through to see if anything changed, and also I believe there was a trophy for doing so. I'm not sure - I don't look up any trophies on a first run lol First timers should love this game - especially puzzle connoisseurs - and veterans should welcome the changes and addition. My favorite part is the Persona 5 soundtracks that show up in the jukebox at the bar!! If you don't like puzzle games, I think there is an option to either skip the puzzles all together or an 'easy' mode to blow through them and focus on the story. Don't hold me to that though! :)",5,6,3,377,1524,28,514,11,15,56.7,13.86,7.11,16.68
"Catherine is a game I meant to play when it was on the PS3, but this remake is outstanding. It's the story of Vincent and his relationship with a woman named Katherine, his longtime girlfriend, and Catherine, a woman he's cheating on her with. It's sexy, but it's really a mature story about a guy trying to decide on what's important to him. One half of the gameplay consists of you sitting in the Stray Sheep Bar talking with friends, answering messages on your phone, and generally moving the story forward. The other half is Vincent's nightly nightmare climb up a wall. You can move the blocks around to create a path up the wall, and it's generally clever. The puzzles become more dangerous as you progress, and it's never boring. The presentation is amazing. Even though it's a remake, the visuals are great, but this game's art is packed with style in every frame. It's probably the best of the year in the way it combines the music, visuals, and voices. It's really that good. If you waited to play it, Catherine: Full Body is ready for you to lose yourself in it's colorful story and world.",5,2,0,211,862,23,307,12,7,65.9,8.44,6.54,11.39

I may or may not have purchased it on Steam as well, hard to say. I'm giving Capcom the benefit of the doubt that this version works and the games are at least as competent adventures as they were 10 years ago, in which case this game is definitely worth picking up for some solid weekend/after work stress outlet gaming. If you've never tried the series then this is obviously the best way to do so, but if like me you just keep buying this product without playing it then I think the writing is on the wall and maybe you can wait for the inevitable PS5 HD collection to drop instead?",4,0,3,145,570,8,188,6,10,72.62,9.13,6.09,11.87

For example, the objectively 'right' choices are either burning your supplies to keep the enemies from getting them and losing morale for people who are going to starve to death anyway or losing one of your few in-battle protagonists. Sometimes every single choice you are given ends EXACTLY the same way no matter what because your enemy is literally the devil and he's smarter than everyone. To top this off the game takes place in norse mythology so Raganatok is still in play albeit jormagundr can't eat the world really quick because the dredge are complete jerks and didn't tell him christmas was canceled.

However, it feels that developers spent more time on Mad Max, as Just Cause 3 felt a little underwhelming. For a perfect score on Just Cause 3 it would need much more time before release (being a Grand Theft Auto world and all); developers' needed more tweaking of specific things; such as expanding the gameplay/sea-life/ structures/AI/ and simple glitches patches before release!! Just Cause 3 is definitely not the game of the year, although at times, you release it really could have been; given more time and effort (but again, developers can only do as much as the budget they were given).

I also enjoyed the slight change to combat mechanics, which in other Lego games is simple and repetitive. The game's story follows the movie pretty closely, and clips from the movie are sprinkled in through the journey... although the voices (and some lines) felt like they'd been changed?

"It took me around 20 plus hour to beat the game so In terms of hour per dollar I guess its worth $60. However there are several issues with it that make me wish I waited for a sale. The issues I have with the game are with its combat, controls, enemies, open world, and main missions. The controls are not as responsive as I would like them to be which actually slows the combat and as for the combat it is too simple which makes it dull. There are only two types of enemies grunts and bosses, the boss fights being the only good part. However, due to the combat being dull the bosses are fought in the same way as the grunts which disappoints. Now we have the open wold well that sucks too, it is empty hardly any A.I. and the ones we do get lack variety which the grunt enemies also suffer from. Finally to the main missions, while I did like the story the way several missions were designed made the experience lackluster. There are several main missions that there sole purpose is to prolong the story, half of those 20 plus hours I mentioned I played are because of these time consuming missions. One mission literally asks you to do several side quest like missions in order to continue the story another has you defeat the same group of enemies 9 times. There are 2 mission that ask you to find something which becomes extremely time consuming because the area to search is almost the whole map, these two mission should have been side quests. Also there is no second gear mode and forth gear mode sucks I do more damage using red hawk instead. Okay now hopefully I convinced you to wait for a sell and not buy it for full price like I did. P.S. The score would be lower but I'm being generous because its One Piece(my #1 manga series).",3,0,1,333,1382,26,452,18,8,73.23,7.64,7,10.52

"First off, lets take a minute to observe that the Metro series has, and most likely always will be, a series thats success is built primarily on the cult following of players whove always had a deep love for whats being offered with the franchise. But thats not to say that each new entry hasnt attempted to do something special that opens the door for new players. Not the gimmicky sort of special, but the kind that has charm and care in the details during creation - especially concerning the players immersion. 4A is by and large a AA developer, some could even consider them somewhat of an independent studio when it comes to their working conditions and team size. While this aspect definitely shows through at times in all of the Metro games, the series also operates on par with, and sometimes better than, big budget blowouts. Exodus is absolutely no different. Just like Last Light did previously, Exodus takes what came before and tries to refine the fat down, while also building upon the strengths of the series. And just like all other entries in the Metro series, Exodus releases to mixed reviews, and a somewhat bitter reception from all to the bugs that are all too familiar to a Metro release. For those new to the series: Metro is a narrative driven survival FPS, with an emphasis on SURVIVAL. While not Resident Evil, Dead Space, or The Last of us - Metro does embody elements from these sort of titles. But also brings to mind titles like Singularity, Fallout, and most importantly S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - post-apocalyptic, (mostly) stealth-driven shooters that are hellbent on immersing the player in the atmospheric wasteland, then challenging them to survive the world and its deadly inhabitants. Metro leans more towards the horror outings with its creature designs and dreadful tones. Previous Metro titles focused more on linear and claustrophobic levels, whereas Exodus allows the player to exit the confines of the Metro underground and explore semi-open world wastelands, each broken up by the four seasons, as well offering completely different environments. This isnt to say the linear and claustrophobic environments arent still preserved. In fact, Exodus does a good job funneling its levels down into some intense areas that operate just like previous titles. The open environments still leave the player open for encounters out in the wild, these tend to feel a little less intense, and sometimes frustrating depending on the enemy behaviors. Human enemies can be rather dumb. And the creatures tend to be viscous and overbearing. Though these issues arent all encompassing of the game, nor do they really break immersion. Gunplay has never been priority in Metro, as opposed to the overall feel of the experience, but they do their job in feeling pretty good to shoot. Especially some of the more creative weapon build outs. Those who have played Metro Redux know the gunplay can feel comfortable and good, though that wasnt always the case - and the same goes again with Exodus. The guns feel good and do their job, but the perfection of the aim falls apart at distances, and sometimes when playing stealthy. Some frustrations came from the lack of pulling off a headshot, even though you had the enemy lined up perfectly. This is an area Id personally like to see patched up, and soon, as the guns are great and would be even better with precision. Players looking for action, twitch type gunplay will find themselves disappointed with Metro, as the series is focused on more concentrated and paced out scenarios - survival scenarios. This by and large plays into movement too. Metro is not creamy or crunchy, but more janky, like...Fallout, though with a better emphasis on gun control and button mapping. Speaking of movement, the character is definitely more of a tank - despite the sound design saying different - thus even running will make you feel like gravity is hugging you in its entirety. This is to translate the reality of the character to the player, and it definitely works. Right up until you take your feet off the trail and into the sticks - this is when movement gets a little sticky and the character hangs up on literally everything. Again, I get the immersion factor here, but in this case its absolutely breaking the immersion - a mechanic that shouldve been streamlined for the sake of optimization. Among all of Metros immersion mechanics, this is really the only one I felt could go far away and never come back. The rest I found to be alright, and far from the complaints of other reviewers. Many of which seem to come from lack of holding the players hand - something that opposing reviewers have knocked the game for. But by and large, most complaints that I see against the game are features overlooked by the player. As mentioned, Metro is a game that likes immersion, therefore HUD elements are greatly reduced to be non-existent, and instead incorporated onto the character - much like Dead Space. Most of these features are put on the wrist of the character in the form of watches/bands. Most importantly is the compass, which will always point you towards your waypoint. This is not given immediately, but instead a little later on after the tutorial period. Right from the start you will have a radiation gauge on your wrist, so you can monitor areas where a gas mask is needed. The map seems to be a tricky thing for some players, but fear not THERE IS A MAP, and the map does tell you what your main mission is if you flip it over. Main objectives are marked with a big X on the map, while side missions will show up as smaller (!) marks on the map - the player is absolutely free to approach what they want, however they desire - with only 1 or 2 being a little confusing at first. Side Missions will provide you with game-changing gear in some circumstances, so theyre worth doing, not to mention theyre nothing exhausting. Crafting is another fantastic addition that can be easily overlooked by both old and new players. Your backpack and crafting tables should be taken advantage of, especially if youre a player thats finding themself short of supplies or bullets. You can craft everything needed at these 2 places - the backpack is great for building a lot of survival supplies on the fly: health, air filters, ball bearing ammo, arrows, and other similar items to keep you going. And the tables will permit the player to get into deeper customizations and crafting. But most importantly is guns. You can pick up and put down any gun you comes across, as well as dissemble them for parts and ammo. Players can carry 2 guns and 1 specialty gun (I.E. Air Pressure gun or Crossbow) and all guns can be altered with parts found, or just to your hearts content, straight out of the backpack. Overall, theres a lot of greatness to be experienced in Metro Exodus, especially if youre a fan of the series. A vast beautiful, and atmospheric game full of tense moments, as well as adventurous moments into the wild open environments to find crafting items and lore. The gameplay is great blend of survival and gunplay. It offers a stylistic blend of horror and post-apocalyptic sci-fi to immerse players in the story of Artyom and his family of merry misfits that have just emerged from the underground. Though its not to say the game comes without some shortcomings upon release. Hiccups and bugs are definitely present, though I personally havent experienced anything game breaking in my playthroughs...yet. Load times are a little too long, though as some have said - its mainly when booting the game up into the first gameplay of the day, or if you reset the game. The load times are a little shorter between deaths, though Ive had a few bouts of waiting that were near 2 minutes, and thats a little ridiculous in-between deaths. My biggest gripes are toward the lack of precision in gunplay/shooting, and getting hung up on the environment when exploring off the path. Those 2 really broke immersion for me and became frustrating at times - looking at you sticky environment. The gunplay issue can be compensated for once the player learns the guns, but its still something thatd really help if it were fixed. But knowing 4A Games is basically a AA developer with the skeleton framing of an independent studio, theyve really done a fantastic job building a AAA experience, and hopefully with a little time well see these minor issues with Exodus get tightened up properly for players in the fence waiting.",4,3,0,1468,6819,186,2240,75,11,57.88,10.05,10,12.9

"First off the game itself isn't that bad, up to personal preference though definitely not as good as the first two metro games, especially last light. Anyway the reason it is terrible and nearly unplayable is the bugs. There are so many bugs it should have been called Metro the Try Not to Die For No Reason Simulator. My first playthrough managed to finish the game despite several bugs that were very annoying but not gamebreaking (ie, enemies can see knocked out enemies in dark rooms through walls and floors, bullets and throwing knives will randomly go through enemies with no effect other than alerting them to your pressence, when driving if I pulled up the map the camera would change so i couldn't see where I was going until i got out of the van and back in again literally half the time, etc, etc, etc.. Now the nearly unplayable comes in for my second and third attempted playthroughs to get the bad ending and finish on ranger hardcore and iron mode. On ranger hardcore I had several of the same issues I had on my first playthrough, which were very detrimental considering there are no auto saves and you are at the mercy of the games horrible auto save feature which somehow made me lose half of my inventory on one and considering you must spend time scavenging for supplies without any autosave, at least in my experience, until you made it to your objective or a question mark on the map usually meant 20 or so minutes of scavenging wasted each time I died. Combine that with the fact that a 3 foot drop will kill you and running or walking, yes walking, will somehow launch you forward off of the stairs to the ground below and possibly your death. After about 4 hours of that I decided to wait on ranger hardcore and try out iron mode, which only has saves at the start of each mission, on a lower difficulty to get another playthrough under my belt and further familiarize myself with the game. I made it to the volga and got out of the church, got attacked by the catfish, got to the shore, started talking to duke and suffocated in fresh air, with my fully intact gas mask on and over 14 minutes worth of filters. I tried to change filters and nothing happened, I took off my mask and put it back on and tried to change filters again but I just died. I tried again, having to start at the beginning of the level, and was in the process of clearing out the church when I walked into one of the closed rooms where someone was behind a desk with a little candle on it and to save ammo I hit them with a melee attack and was burst into flames as I was instakilled by a little candle. I have no problem or issue with difficult games but if developers are going to put them in their games, well, the games need to work. This is a game that has been out for over a year. I have version 1.07 so it has had 7 patches. The developers released 2 dlcs and patched in a new difficulty without fixing the issues that make the high difficulties nearly impossible. The game never should have been released in its current state now let alone over a year ago in as hard as it is to believe a worse state than it is now. I was looking forward to this game but I think I may be done with metro an 4A and I really cannot understand the praise that I see for this game everywhere so I wanted to pass along my experience to try to save others the extreme disappointment that is this game. In closing I would like to expand on my answer to the question would I recommend this to a friend? No, I wouldn't recommend this game to my biggest enemy.",1,2,0,677,2822,58,942,20,16,54.76,14.03,7.84,16.97

"I really wanted to love this game. i've played both Metro titles on PS4 and thoroughly enjoyed both. Exodus looked terrific based on trailers and previews, and in a lot of aspects it is terrific. It looks absolutely incredible, so if you just want a game for some eye candy, you can't go wrong here. It's among the best looking games I've every played on console. However, there are some huge negatives here. And the big one for me is the framerate. I've played a lot of games at 30 FPS as a console gamer, and I don't despise it. I prefer 60 obviously, but I can live with 30. However Exodus struggles to stay at a consistent 30, and the gameplay/gunplay just feels awful. I'm not sure if that's a result of the framerate or what, but any type of movement is a total slog. It's a pain just to turn in this game. Aiming and shooting guns is comical. The best way for me to describe it is like they took a walking simulator (think about something with really slow awful movement like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or something) and gave you a gun. The environments are gorgeous, but the way you interact with them is brutal. Let's not even get started on the voice acting, AI or character animations. All of which feel decidedly last gen. Which is all the more striking considering how next gen the game *looks*. So yeah, a game I wanted to love, but it just would not let me. Maybe it's better on the PC. I've heard as much. But as a PS4 game (i played on a Pro btw) there's just no way I can recommend it in its current state.

"'Resident Evil with samurais' was probably the most common description for the Onimusha series. Like its sister series, Onimusha featured bygone gaming designs like fixed-camera angles, pre-rendered backgrounds, and tank controls. Capcom married these three elements into many of their games, creating fantastic and epic titles that still hold up today. While newer gamers may take some time getting used to these design choices, veteran players will feel very familiar with the setup and find their groove as they hack and slash the demonic hordes in this feudal era-inspired action-horror. Everything has been given a nice HD touch, though this does reveal some glaring graphical limitations, but the aim is to present the game in a perfected format rather than achieving the fidelity of modern-day titles. The biggest change however comes in the music, which has been remade from the ground up due to events concerning the original chief musician for the game. However, the new soundtrack remains largely faithful to the feel of the original, and the original sound effects are still present and accounted for. The Trophy/Honors the game now boast will surely challenge old and new players to put their skills to the test. Here's hoping Capcom brings the series back to life with a new installment.",4,1,0,218,1064,30,346,9,14,47.98,12.59,11.68,15.19

From cleaned up visuals to tighter controls (the old RE tank controls are gone.) this game is just as great now as when it first came out. Everything from soul collecting to power up your weapons to puzzles to boss fights are as fun as ever. And at the $19,99 price point this is a must buy. Hopefully it sells well so Capcom decides to make a new game in the series. And who knows maybe we'll see Dino Crisis get a remaster soon as well...",5,1,0,103,408,7,137,7,5,79.37,5.84,5.48,8.6

"If you're a fan of the first 3 Resident Evil games you'll feel right at home with Onimusha. The game uses the same fixed camera angles, map layout and puzzles.

"I am an old-school RPG gamer and purchased Prey recently after needing a break from replaying Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Assassin's Creed Odyssey for the umpteenth time. After reviewing some of the gaming websites feedback, I thought I'd risk the $15 on checking this out. I was not disappointed. It is almost like playing a new version of System Shock mixed in with some more horror-ish themes. It is not overly gory so just horror-ish with the types of enemies and some that utilize the element of surprise...I'm looking at you Mimics. I'm probably only halfway through the game but am thoroughly enjoying it. This is not a shootem-up killer game. Ammo is relatively precious but can be made once you figure out how to recycle just about anything thanks to the recycler charge. I do like that there are many ways to navigate obstacles. It's mostly a slow, methodical exploration game but there are some enemies that make you run as fast as you can to change locations if you can't fight. Highly recommended game for a very small investment if this is your style game.",5,4,0,198,850,27,292,12,8,65.32,8.25,7.65,12.05

"If you're like me, and you've been waiting for word of Half 2 Chapter 3 (or Half Life 3, or really Half Life ANYTHING), you've probably given up hope. While we may never see another installment in the series from Valve, Bethesda has done the next best thing by delivering Prey. That is not to say that this is a clone of Half Life - far from. But it delivers much the same atmosphere, and admittedly a similar premise. Something goes wrong during a scientific experiment, and all heck (really Best Buy, I have to say 'heck'?) breaks loose. The game-play can, at times, be nerve wracking (in a good way) much like Half Life could be. DO NOT try to treat this like a COD-style shooter - you will die. A lot.

"I love scrounging for good cheap games. @ eight bucks I thought Prey was worth the risk after reading a couple of reviews. Ive already gotten my moneys worth. This is a first person shooter /survival game. It reminds me of Half-Life, a really good game that is probably older than many of you out there. Prey is a science fiction game with a pretty good story involving dangerous aliens, family betrayal, and time manipulation. It is a slower paced game with many clues and keys to track down in order to unravel the mystery of what happened to your characters memory and figure out why almost everyone on the Talos 1 space station is dead. It seems like a long game, as Ive played over 20 hours and I dont feel like I am even close to the end. The graphics & sound are well done.

I can unleash my inner dark side by unleashing stealth attacks upon unsuspecting foes... and feel great about it. At times the XBox controls (left analog) are a little finicky, hence a 4/5 instead of a full 5. Very worthwhile and if you are a LoTR fan, you will enjoy some of the historical back story.",4,1,0,84,368,11,124,6,7,67.74,7.29,7.85,10.84
"Maybe I should have done more research before purchasing this game. Shadow of Mordor is the reason I bought an Xbox One. However, I was disappointed to discover it follows the Arkham Asylum-esque battle systems we see so much anymore. That may make me biased in my review since i absolutely hate that system as it's always so slow and clunky but I failed to get very far into the game because of it. For fans of the fighting mechanics of the Batman games I would definitely recommend this. Anyone else I would say to give it a pass.",2,1,0,101,425,11,147,6,7,66.62,8.15,7.18,11.09
"The DLC campaigns that are now on the disc for this edition and add very interesting twists to the gameplay of Shadow of Mordor. Frankly, it would have been nice to have some of these elements in the main campaign, but this would have changed the game significantly, so its understandable that the developers didn't do this. The stories in these campaigns aren't deep, so lore fans may be disappointed. In addition there are challenging 'Test of' modes that make you complete certain tasks within a time limit. I found these tests very compelling despite how long they took and how difficult they could be. I enjoyed mastering the techniques needed to do well. Others might find it frustrating. All together, I'm glad I picked up this version of Mordor with all the additional content, especially at the great price I got it from Best Buy.",5,1,0,149,675,18,218,8,10,64.15,8.94,9.25,12.28
"Shadow of Mordor follows Talion as he seeks revenge on those who killed his family. The gameplay is a mix between the recent Batman series (free flow combat) and Assassin's Creed. The game does a great job of immersing you into the world of LOTR, and does a great job of telling a solid story. You won't quite find the combat up to Batman standards, but it is a lot of fun. The open world experience is really where the action stands out. There's plenty of quests to enjoy and with the game of the year edition, there's probably 40+ hours of content if you want to experience everything.",5,1,0,113,463,10,160,6,8,67.93,8.46,6.72,11.07

"As stated above this will be a review of the contents of the box only NOT the game as I have not had enough time playing it to provide a fair and well informed Software review. The Rune Factory Archival edition, in addition to the game includes a music CD, artbook, and DLC voucher. i would also like to add that the included 41 page instruction booklet is a pleasant bonus for anybody not purchasing the game digitally. The Musical CD although not the full 94 track OST (track number estimated from the original game release) does offer a fairly generous 36 track music selection. For those unaware these type of collections usually only include 3-10 track musical demos on CD More extensive musical selections are usually reserved for for download only if offered at all. In addition the majority of the tracks included have been a joy to listen to. Next we have the artbook. This, I believe, is where this collection gets its name from. The book contains art, design, and notes(in english) spanning the entire rune factory series up to this point. At approximately 160 pages this book is the size and volume of a novella and is packed full of beaut drawings on good quality (to my inexperienced eyes) pages. Last we have the DLC which I have yet to experience due to my limited time with the game. However, my understanding is that this content is almost exclusively a series of short visual novel experiences revolving around each of the romance-able NPC characters. If so its value will likely depend on your enjoyment from that type of game. I find myself enjoying finding out more about a series that up until now I had barely any interest. The artbook and the fun Ive had so far with the game has piqued my interest. My only nitpick is in the content of the CD. I think it might have been more fitting for the selection to, like the artbook, feature music from all previous games in the series. I enjoy what was provided in quality, variety, and quantity but I cannot help but feel this was a missed opportunity to transform this package into an indispensable look back at the history of the series for fans both new and old. In conclusion I have enjoyed the extra content beyond the $20 higher price tag from the standard and digital edition of the game. Ultimately though I believe those who will value these extras the most will be existing fans, but that doesnt mean potential new fans wont be able to find enjoyment from them. I know I did.",4,4,0,445,1969,61,679,21,11,56.24,10.68,8.82,13.96

"As a fan of the Yakuza series I was a little hesitant to give this one a try but after spending almost 30 hours Im glad I did. This game does a great job making you feel like a detective that skirts the boundaries of the law to get necessary information. The story is pretty good and for the most part the game looks and runs good too. Im playing on a Pro and while the frame rate does drop at times its not enough to take away from the experience. Another minor issue I have is the game is not Pro enhanced at all meaning you will see jaggies everywhere if you are playing on a 4K tv. The English voice acting is not good despite the voice actors best efforts. Its hard to listen to Yakuza bosses speak with a western cowboy twang and where there should be inflections in the dialogue at times its nowhere to be found. It all feels off. Id recommend playing with the Japanese voices and your native language subtitles. The fighting mechanics feel a little bland but otherwise provide suitable entertainment. It never gets old smashing enemies faces in with bikes, road cones or flashing signs. If you are a newcomer to the series then this is a wonderful entry to the game style Yakuza is well known for. You dont have to play any of the Yakuza games to understand whats going on and for the fans then youll be pleased to know the city of Kamurocho is alive and thriving. The dramatic story is full of twists and surprises. The graphics are amazing and youll often forget youre playing a game during cut scenes. If you own a PS4 and have a remote interest in these types of games then youll have a good time with Judgment.",5,2,0,307,1300,31,429,16,9,69.14,8.38,7.56,11.71

The original Japanese voice tracks are still available for fans of that more authentic vibe too. Loads of content. Great action. Definite must-play.",5,1,0,84,367,12,122,6,7,69.75,7.01,7.78,11.31

"Judgment is technically not a sequel to anything, but it's basically a Yakuza game (and even takes place in Kamurocho like those games do). That said, you don't have to have any previous knowledge in order to enjoy this game. You play as a lawyer-gone-detective and are tasked with solving cases that the plot puts before you. In doing so, you may find yourself getting involved in fisticuffs with random gang members. The combat is great and makes interesting use of the environment (such as using the swing set at a playground to kick a dude in the face). The investigation portion of it doesn't add much to the experience, but it's a nice change of pace from the usual Yakuza antics. If you get bored of the main plot, there are plenty of side activities (though sadly karaoke isn't one of them). Highly recommended!",5,0,1,152,649,17,224,8,9,62.88,9.21,7.75,12.07
"I love how they are combining Detective Conan & Phoenix Wright into one game! The main character is pretty awesome the whole story is amazing and the side missions never bore I can't stop talking about how good this game is!!! I usually don't like a lot of fighting in single player games because of the way they fight *as in the controls suck for fighting or fighting just isn't that good* Batman Arkham games & Marvels Spiderman along with God of War has had the best fighting for me currently! But Judgement is up there too now no powers so he's like Batman a bit for me which is why I love it even more! All the other characters in the story are pretty amazing the girl that works in that law place reminds me of Hibiki *Anime* *Movie* worth watching! The whole story feels real with the characters real reactions like they are surprised when they should be at death and not giving a lame reaction to it. I love how you can fly drones around too and take pictures in the game lol along with the chasing down and tailing people as well the boss fights are fun too!!! LOVE when a game like this has good boss fights not everyone does them correctly or make them fun enough and challenging. Lastly, I recommend this game to anyone who wants Law, Detective Work, & Fighting involved in all one game SEGA really hit it out of the park with this Main story, side missions, characters. So freaking good!! I am in Chapter 2 now of the game so fun I don't want it to end trust me you won't regret buying this if you are looking for Detective & Fighting related stuff the Law involved was just a bonus and makes it even better!",5,0,1,309,1278,23,418,11,13,63.88,11.33,7.47,14.21

"It doesn't have robust or branching skill tree of fighting like Yakuza 0 or the food exp system like the Kiwami. The art style is definitely lighter in tone but the game world and locations are noticeably shallower in both depth and detail. The voice acting, that is the english dub, is fine when it pops up. The problem is that only does 25% of the time. Outside of Main Story cutscenes, there is no dub or it is found piecemeal and jarred between different lines of opposite characters. There is literally a scene where you solve a case for TWINS SITTING NEXT TO EACHOTHER and one of them speaks perfect english and the speaks completely in japanese in front of the player character who also speaking english. There is another scene where there is a Musician who greets her audience IN ENGLISH and then proceeds to sing entirely in the japanese dub, returning to english after. There are too many examples of this. SEGA wants people to believe they didn't cheap out on the dub by hiring union va's but the reality is that they cut corners literally EVERYWHERE ELSE. To add, I'm talking about both branches of SEGA who worked in tandem to decide these choices especially seeing that they chose in the past to digitally edit out several of their 3D models to erase the likeness of an individual associated with criminal activity, in a game series about YAKUZA and DETECTIVES. That takes more time and money out of their profits after the fact than finishing the dub properly. They were even deceptive enough to toss a survey in the direction of all current owners of the game asking if the dub was passable in a thinly veiled series of questions to excuse not paying for a dub in the future most likely.",4,0,2,310,1375,40,467,12,13,53.17,12.26,9.13,15.49

"Doom was one of the best games released in 2016. Now it is available for the Nintendo Switch, and the experience is just as good as it was on other consoles last year. The Switch port has graphical compromises as it is essentially a tablet, but once you start slaying demons on the go you'll quickly realize that they are well worth it. Doom is worth being played on any console, but only on Switch will you be able to play it portably. Overall this is a fantastic port and while playing it on my Switch I couldn't help but keep looking at the system itself and wondering how it could play this game. Definitely recommend as it is a fantastic game, and also a showpiece for what the diminutive Switch is capable of.",5,7,2,136,570,18,193,6,10,63.77,10,7.54,14.36

I owned the Xbox version of this, and yes, the graphics aren't as good on the switch, yes it runs at 30fps vs 60 (although I honestly don't notice the difference too much to be honest), but it still runs great! You'd be a fool to expect the exact same performance as ps4/xbox. Definite must buy for switch owners, especially if you never owned last year's version.",5,2,0,96,369,6,122,5,7,79.83,6.89,5.26,10.18
"I have only played Doom in handheld mode, so I have yet to see how it runs on a TV. I am beyond impressed with how it runs on handheld mode. It is evident many compromises have been made to accommodate such a taxing game on what is essentially an NVIDIA Shield tablet, but the experience is excellent. Motion blur is utilized to smooth out any choppy frame drops that occur from time to time. I have played about five hours in the campaign on a fully charged Switch, and after two the battery was at 55%, so if you take this on the go, have a back up battery or your charger handy. The controls are smooth but it takes a minute to get used to pressing down on the right stick for action. Overall, I strongly recommend this game to any Switch owner that has any desire to see more FPS and third-party titles on the system. It's not every day you see a fully-realized triple A game on Nintendo hardware. I will update this review once I dock the system and play it on my TV.",5,3,1,192,765,13,262,9,9,69.74,8.83,6.24,11.24

The game looks and plays just like the Doom we all know and love. Sure it's only 720p in handheld mode and only runs at 60 fps but who cares...why? Because I'm holding portable DOOM in my hands and can play DOOM anywhere I want. Not only is the campaign good but the Switch version also includes Arcade Mode and Online Multiplayer. Is it worth full price for a game that's been out for over a year on other systems? Well, that's the nice thing about being a Gamers Reward member. I got $10,00 back for reserving Mario Odessey and used it towards Doom along with my 20% discount. Not bad.

"With the latest update Bethesda forces you to download an 8 gig update to play the single player campaign. The update includes the multiplayer. it took me roughly 2 hours before I could play the game, that is unacceptable. During the marketing of the game Bethesda said the single player would be on the cartridge and the multiplayer was an optional download. Apparently that is not the case, Bethesda is forcing you to download the multiplayer to play the single player.

"It's cool to see a great, AAA, 3rd Party FPS get a portable version on Switch; but this port feels rushed, and suffers from some annoying bugs. I suppose my first complaint is subjective, as it has to do with graphic fidelity, but here it goes.. there is a fine line to walk when trading off graphics/frame-rate for portability, in my opinion, they failed here.... the reality is, Doom is a fast paced shooter, even in single player campaign, and while the 30 fps cap (and quite a few dips below) doesn't ruin the game on it's own, the reduced/scaling field of view, apparent motion blur (turning this off in settings doesn't seem to help) combined with the dark/low-lit nature of the game, makes it difficult to enjoy. My second complaint is more objective, with no room for argument... there are MAJOR audio glitches in this port. I've experienced frequent, random LOUD buzzing sounds throughout the few hours I've played; and at about a 3rd through the level 'Argent Energy Tower' had the audio completely go out. I hope that they can at least fix these audio problems with a patch soon; and perhaps I will update my review at that time, but as of writing this, this port is not worth the buy... especially since better versions exist on other platforms, often on sale for a 3rd of the price or less (INB4 'but it's portable!' - yes, and so are many AAA games of the past on iOS/android, but I can't be bothered with most of those either because the overall/consistent experience isn't there).",1,9,9,281,1163,24,388,10,13,61.5,11.66,7.48,14.66

The opening animation was really well done(In both sound, energy and looks). The game itself looks bright, colorful, weird and most of all charming. The games controls are excellent. The gameplay was quite solid too. If you couldn't already tell, I really, really like this game!

The drawback to this game for me (not to most others, I'm sure) is that all of the other game modes are competitive, and my wife will never be as good as I am at them so they are just sort of wasted (the way I'm playing this game).

I love the cooperation aspect of the game where we all have to work together and its not a problem if someone makes a mistake and trims too much off the other person. All that person does is hold a button to reset their character and then get clipped again. Im looking forward to playing again with my kids tonight! No guns, no killing but if you need a little more action and want to run around the screen chasing each other and snipping your teammates to shreds, go for it! They respawn and the chase it on again!

Each round typically takes just a few minutes, so it's easy to play when you have a few minutes spare.

"Snipperclips is exactly the kind of game you want to own for your Switch. It's perfect in shorter play sessions for on the go or simply at home with friends/family on the couch. It's primarily a puzzle game where you control a character in the form of a piece of paper and 'snip' or cut out pieces of yourself or your partner to create various shapes that will help you solve puzzles of different types. They do a good job mixing up the different ways you'll need to use the mechanic to solve these bite sized puzzles and it never felt boring or overdone. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, but also offers plenty of levels to make your way through. I completed it entirely with a friend and we really enjoyed the game; it left us wanting more too! There are some other mini-game type modes included which offer up some more competitive fun if you're interested in that.

How you solve the puzzle is up to you which is the fun. There is also some fun mini games like basketball, and a versus mode where you try to cut the other player until they don't have enough paper left to survive.

"I actually like this game a lot so far. I have played a few quests and have ventured into the new main game territory. I will probably update this later if I have any different opinion but wanted to get this out to offset the 1 star review so far. I can say the start is a slow burn but I think the main story and side quests are actually very well thought out and can conclude in a number of ways which I like. There is also loot, character customization, and 'Fashion Souls' if you like that kinda thing. The clothing and jewelry you wear can provide benefits to your character which is good. Unfortunately, it does lose 1 star for a few reasons. The game does not have a jump action which I think is a bad choice for an open world game in 2019. Vertical navigation is usually done by falling or moving up stairs or ramps (usually rock debris in a ramp form) but geez Louise jumping would be nice. Furthermore and like the other reviewer here, the combat controls are wonky and a little hard to get used to. At this time in video game evolution, if you are not incorporating Souls-like button mapping with your similar Souls-like combat design, you are stuck in the PS2 era. To add insult to injury, you cannot customize the controls on the PS4 either. Blurgh! Anyway, it's Eurojanky but I do think the graphics are very good, quests are good, loot is good, but controls could be better. Spiders-You Did Good!",4,3,0,267,1115,26,379,15,8,68.68,8.1,7.09,11.02

"At time of review, I am about 30 hours into the game. Graphics: Pros: Some of the areas are really pretty looking and comparable to a AAA game. Cons: On the PS4 it does not look great 50% of the time. Lots of pop ins and texture rendering. Facial animations and cutscenes are sometimes painfully bad(think Mass Effect Andromeda). Story: Pros: Pretty interesting premise. Not similar to another storyline I can recall ever playing before in an RPG. Lots of the side mission story's play into the main mission story. Several ways to approach missions. Dialogue will change depending on who you bring in your party and can effect your relationship status with party members. Cons: The poor graphics unfortunately sometimes affect my enjoyment of the story. The camera is super janky when in dialogue scenes(going through people, odd angle on characters faces, no mouth movement, etc). Also, super repetitive dialogue (the natives repeat the same lines over and over at each tribe you visit, and so does your character). There are some fetch quests before you get info out of people-typical RPG stuff. Gameplay/Combat: Pros: Several ways to approach missions and how you approach will sometimes be dependent on what skills you are building your character with. Warrior, mage, and a mix of gunslinger/rogue/scientist?, are the general classes, but they all really bleed into one another, and can mix it up. I enjoy the so called boss battles. That is when combat feels the best. Lots of armor and weapons to choose from. Can customize them to an extent. Cons: Combat is not that fun to me and got old quick, even with the multiple traps, bombs, swords, magic, etc that can be used. Not a variety of enemies; has more to do with armor rating that enemy type. It just does not feel right when connecting with an enemy and sometimes delays. Sneaking around is not enjoyable. Companion AI is not good, and they will die quick. World/Exploration: The map and how you explore between areas is similar to Dragon Age: Origins-which may be a pro or con for some people. Pros: I like that you can move pretty quickly through an area by running-vs. in Dragon Age: Inquistion where it felt like you got nowhere fast. A couple of the cities do look nice(from a distance). Interesting set up that where you can go is dependent upon what attributes you have, but this also falls into a con... Cons: The exploration is not interesting enough for me to want to go back to areas I was previously unable to due to my attributes (nor do I remember where). Exploring the world can be frustrating; running into invisible walls, not being able to make short hops off areas, but instead having follow the path, then randomly being able hop off another area that is higher up. The only pay off for exploring is finding shrines with a skill point or a random chest (that you may not be able to get into). Most places you find you will probably end up at in another mission, so not a lot of incentive to explore. Minor side missions to find camps and notes on beasts does not feel worth it. The cities are copy and paste, then slap a new skin on it. How you traverse the city changes, but once you step inside a building they are duplicates with new skins from one to next. Things to Note-Bugs Aplenty: Serious frame drops during gameplay on occasion and sometimes dialogue scenes freeze. Lots of graphic issues-seriously. I have not had hard crashes or data erased though. I would recommend as long as you understand this is a AA game and comes with all the issues you could expect from one, and is not going to have the polish. It feels a bit like a PS3 game.",3,1,0,659,2874,79,976,43,7,65.98,7.86,7.91,10.93
"I followed the reviews on this game and it looked good so I decided to give it a try. I played it to the end it was a fun game for me. A little different style of play but a welcome difference.

"Greedfall is the story of a French-looking colonial kingdom in search for a cure to a plague currently ransacking its populace. In this game you will play as a character who is in search of any answers for this sickness, leading your original created character to a new continent never before seen by colonial eyes, hoping beyond hope for help. If you've played Dragon Age, Mass Effect, or any other old BioWare role playing game, you've essentially played Greedfall before then. All the old beats are there, with such fun as character romancing, class choosing, story and world building with deep, rich writing, it's all there. Battle system is a little linear but still a lot of fun, with a fast-paced action tilt reminiscent of PS2 era RPGs, like Star Ocean or the Tales Of games. You and your two partners will be slicing, exploding, and bashing your way all through a beautiful island countryside. The story is a little predictable, but it's still full and rich, a decided contrast to most RPGs nowadays that just throw you into the action without giving you any reason to fight to in the first place. Writing will never be an issue with Greedfall, always throwing some delightfully devilish story detail your way. Plot driven and full of action, Greedfall might not be the biggest game you'll play, but for a double-A caliber title in 2019 it sure doesn't disappoint. Worth a purchase!",4,1,0,249,1114,27,368,10,13,56.53,11.56,9.32,14.3

"This is spiders latest title. You may know some of their other games like Technomancer. Greedfall harkens back to a time of rpgs like the first dragon age or mass effect. There is a minor amount of bugs to the game but they're overshadowed by the deep character customization that actually has an effect on the paths you can take. Talking your way out of a situation is just as effective as drawing a sword and allows you to take on quests in different ways instead of just go to x and kill y. Builds have complete freedom where you could make a warrior, thief, and mage if you wanted to go the vanilla choices or you could dabble into a little of every tree to make a hybrid that's able to tackle the toughest challenges in a unique way. Overall I suggest this to anyone that was a fan of rpgs that put more of a focus on quests being about a freedom of choice instead of being railroaded into one option.",4,1,0,175,723,14,248,7,11,61.57,10.88,7.31,13.2

"I've been following the developer Spiders for years. From Mars War Logs to The Technomancer. With the exception of Bound By Flame each game has been a solid step forward. Greedfall is by far their largest and most ambitious title. Combat will take a little getting used to for some, but for me it wasn't difficult as it is quite similar to The Technomancer. It's certainly not a AAA title, but it is a very well done game. Spiders is a small studio and doesn't have the benefit of blockbuster budgets. Hopefully this title will finally get them some recognition.",4,1,0,104,449,15,153,8,6,69.18,6.84,7.31,10.97
"The game takes a while to play through which is really its only strong point. It simply does not do anything that well however. There are several spots that could have used more polish. From the graphics which are good but nothing along the lines of a game by Ubisoft or other large studios to the problems with some quests. At one point I had to go back and get a regular healing potion for a quest because it would not allow me to use a greater healing potion to heal the individual. These types of little issues really added up and made the game seem unfinished. It also did not really feel like a roleplaying game to me.",1,1,1,119,499,11,163,7,7,73.7,7.2,7.12,10.5

"Now, I understand why many stores don't have this in stock. This is simply awful, in everything. The graphics are average when you compare it to everything else on the market, so if you were at least trying to see something pretty, that's not it. The controls are probably some of the worst controls I've seen in recent games. Go back 10 years in the past, controls and camera work were better. Gameplay is atrocious, combined with the awful controls and you get some of the lamest combat sequence ever. If you played Assassin Creed 1, 10 years ago, they had better combat. I feel like I just thrown $40 down the trash. Don't be like me, spend your $40 on better games, almost everything else is better than this.",1,2,26,134,559,10,181,9,6,77.45,6.16,6.74,8.94

Not everyone will enjoy its puzzle, tower building, missions. The story is great though, I love the different choices that were offered and that they mattered to the story. Make the wrong ones and our 'hero' Vincent will not be getting the ''happy ever after ending.'' If you want a thinking game however, with a different story than your typical one in video games that is mixed with a little horror and romance then this game will be for you. I personally give it 5 out of 5!",5,1,0,117,489,12,168,8,6,70.51,7.06,6.75,9.95

I am not sure if there are more levels because it's been a while since I played the original, but I'd have to assume there are.",5,1,0,95,353,4,118,6,4,85.68,5.24,4.18,8.02
"The game is just as good as the original release. The packaging however, is not up to snuff for a premium collectors edition. This version of the game includes a steelbook, however the games title is not printed on the spine of the steelbook, and there is no slipcover that goes over it to resolve this issue. Every other version of the game did include the slipcover for the steelbook, and it was even included in other region's version of this product.

"The concept for this game is great, but even months after release, this title is still filled with bugs. I've encountered more game breaking bugs in this game than in any other title I can think of in recent memory. Buy on sale only, dont pay $60. Combat is also...okay. There's really not much impact or weight behind attacks. Everything feels pretty weak and slow so far (I'm about 10-15 hours in). There's also really unrealistic damage to further break the immersion. In one instance, I shot someone with two arrows, one in the chest, one in the arm, but they still were coming after me like nothing happened (with the arrows sticking out of them). I don't know if that was another bug, or if enemies simply don't react much to limb damage. Overall, it's just an average game. Good idea with a really flawed implementation. So. Many.

"The graphics for this game are beautiful especially the environment. The combat needs some getting use to and can be very wonky at times. I've heard that the game is very difficult at the beginning and very easy late game. At the moment I'm about 70% through the game and things are still pretty difficult unless you just point blank shoot someone with a bow and arrow. The lock picking and pick pocketing is horrendously hard but they seem to have a patch in the works for it so we will see. The story is very good and the voices for the characters are good as well. The game seems to push you into doing the main quest right away due to time limits at certain points so you'll probably just want to focus on the main quest line at first. If you like rpgs its definitely worth a play but until they fix some bugs and some other stuff I'd wait for a sale maybe when its like $40-$45.",4,4,0,175,698,11,228,8,9,74.41,8.31,6.3,11.26
"This game is like if you modded Skyrim with a hardcore mode, only without the fantasy stuff like dragons. You have to manage your hunger, sleep, and dress in dark colors to help sneak better at night. People will even comment on the cleanliness of your clothing (or lack of). Some quests are extremely in depth and have hidden options that you can discover. But because it's so focused on realism there are moments where the game can be a bit dull. You only ever fight other humans and the world has a lot of empty space, as it did in the 1400s. You have to really know what you're getting into with this game to know if you'll like it or not.",4,3,0,126,505,8,167,7,7,76.44,7.07,6.12,9.74

I can't even imagine the original state of the game then, because the bugs that are in it now are pretty terrible. You can certainly still play it, and I've not encountered a game breaking bug yet, but it does really break immersion. NPCs act odd, textures fail to load and pop in is ridiculous. The story is fine, and I like the characters, but it's hard to recommend this game. It's my first regretted purchase of the year.

"PROS: Great Simulator, great graphics and lighting, can sink HOURS into this game without a thought, RPG at its finest CONS: Steep learning curve, takes a lot of practice to do anything well in this game (kind of like real life), not great voice acting, and an antiquated save system Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a great game that takes a lot of effort to get the most out of it. Most of the game centers on training, as you came up a Blacksmith's son you have no real skills to speak of and are laughably bad at nearly everything. As you play, you end up increasing the skills you use the most to create a somewhat unique character to you. Do you stab everything that moves? You will have a high Strength, Agility, and Sword skills. Do you knock out you opponents while they have their back turned and then pilfer all of their hard earned goods? Have fun with that really high stealth skill. In KCD everything matters and makes an impression. Your charisma goes up and down based on how expensive your clothing is or how dirty it is. Your actions will increase or decrease your standing with everyone from the citizenry to the guards to the different millers to make them love or hate you. With low standing you will even be stopped randomly by guards purely because they know your reputation as a thief. A few things to look out for that take a star away from this game include a very antiquated save system. While I understand the save system (it is designed to make fast travel dangerous and make you think about your actions) I still don't LIKE it. Also the lockpicking starts out being nearly impossible, but after lots of practice I can crack Very Hard locks in mere seconds.",4,1,0,309,1342,27,422,14,11,68.89,9.13,8.4,12.32

Game is for just 1 local player at a time. Online playing is for 2+ players. Image resolution (gameplay and theatrical) is very good and the sound is very good as well (and if you have a home theater sound system, the best). I really recommend you use a good headset with this game if you want to hear every tiny sound on the game. MY KIDS LOVE IT!!!!! Customer service: Very good customer service. I was greeted by an employee as soon as I walked through the door.

Do you like nostalgic call-backs in the form of music, sound effects and characters? If you said Yes to any of these, you'll love this game! Dragon Quest Builders 2 is the sequel to the beloved Dragon Quest Builders game. It improves on the original in almost every way. Much like Minecraft, you are thrown into a world that can be build and destroyed. Enemies abound as you search for valuable resources needed to build bigger and better things. What makes this game stand above Minecraft is the plot. You have to complete tasks in order to advance in the game, and learn more crafting recipes to overcome the challenges the game throws at you. There is a multiplayer part to the game that allows you to build with a friend online, if they also own the game. Your multiplayer level is a sandbox world that has no bearing on the main game story or plot line, so it is neither cooperative or competitive in the main game.",5,1,0,196,835,20,274,15,6,75.3,6,6.98,9.31

"I'll start by saying I bought this game on sale for $20, not $60. It's definitely worth it at $20, but probably not at $60. The games are all fun and don't have any game breaking flaws, and I enjoy playing them. They are each available individually from the eshop as well, so if you're only interested in one there's no need to get the full bundle. Since this game truly is three games (including 3 different games on the switch home menu) I'll review each individually. Risk: Overall fun, but a bit slow moving at times. I wish you could skip through the AI's move entirely, since I've been playing long enough I can look at the board after someone moves and instantly tell what happened. Currently, the best you can do is set the AI speed to fast and hit 'a' whenever they attack a territory to skip the dice rolls. On that note, it would be able to skip the dice rolls when it's my turn as well. I don't need a roll-by-roll play through of the battle; I would be more than happy to click attack and have the game spit out who won and how many armies were lost. The only other thing I wished the game had was an option to return to the classic game board and game pieces, but that is a very minor gripe. All that being said, the game is very fun, the controls are intuitive, and the AI is hard enough to present a bit of a challenge. The game also has an autosave feature which is really nice; if you decide you want to play a different game and finish the current risk game later you can pop this game card back in later and pick up right where you left off. 3/5 Monopoly: This is probably the best executed of the three games on this card, in my opinion. One of two gripes I have is with the 3D fields; the view is so zoomed in I sometimes had trouble visualizing where I, an opponent, or a property is on the board, but as I play more I think I could get used to it, and the game does have the option to play on the standard board, which is better in my experience. I also found the manage properties and trade screen a little awkward to navigate, but with so many small properties Ubisoft did about as well as could be expected with the switch controllers. The only thing that might help it out is if the cursor moved a little faster. There is a lot to love about this version of monopoly, however. One of my personal favorite features is the option to play to different goals, which each have realistic time estimates. No one I know would play monopoly with me before this since it took so long, but I think I might have a chance of convincing them now. The different game modes vary from 'first to own a hotel' to 'first to have $2000' or 'first to have a certain number of properties/sets.' The time estimates vary from 25 min to 55 min, and I found them to be fairly accurate playing against an AI. Some of these game modes do a good job mixing up strategy and the play of the game as well; for instance 'first to own a hotel' makes cheap sets much more valuable than expensive ones. I would highly recommend this game. 5/5 Trivial Pursuit Live: I've played this game the least, so I don't have as much to say about it. I've never been a massive trivia pursuit fan, and this one has several mini-game type trivia games that seem a little unnecessary to me. The game is solid, however: the trivia is current, not crazy difficult, and the game does a good job of feeling rewarding even if you're not doing well. 4/5",4,4,0,679,2665,55,909,28,10,68.96,9.66,6.06,12.94

"This game is beautiful and the story is outstanding. But this is a new form of cash grab. The game is a sort of RPG and Ubisoft sells you armors and weapons at various levels. The pre order armors and what not are worthless after minutes into the game. Youll find stronger and better armor in the game within minutes. The boosters are $15 together and $20 separate for both. The game is designed to tempt you reallllllly bad into buying them. They intentionally make it hard to level up after a while and youre stuck grinding to even have a chance against AI who is stronger than you. Micro Transactions in this game is bringing it down. Its basically what happened to destiny 2. It was so difficult to defeat certain enemies that it was no fun. Dont get me wrong, you can level up decently enough, but it will require a large amount of grind where the game becomes a chore rather than fun.

"This game is a blast for kids & the family in General!! Lots of fast paced Sonic fun!!",5,4,0,17,64,2,22,2,1,88.73,3,2.85,8.11
"Sonic Forces is just average from what I played. It's a step down compared to Sonic Generations. There's no drifts, no customizations for boosts & other skills (if you ever played Generations). For Modern Sonic, even when you boost, it doesn't feel quite as fast as he did in Generations & about half the time, the game goes auto-pilot on certain curves & turns slightly for you, even when you hold the boost button, which kinda annoyed me because it feels like they don't think you'll be able to beat the stages on your own. Classic Sonic has some of the worst physics & momentum when you play as him although his stages aren't bad. You just have to get used to landing platforms on his weird air momentum. That's pretty much it. As for the Avatar... I thought it was gonna be the worst part of the game only to end up being my favorite (which isn't saying much). The Avatar char. has a weapon called Wispon which lets you use different types of Wisps: Burst is a flamethrower, Lightning is an electric whip kinda weapon, just to give an example. Getting a Wisp item of your choice will grant you a Super, depending on which Wisp you choose, such as the Burst gives you an exploding jump to get to higher platforms & lightning gives you a ring/enemy dash. From a person who likes Modern Sonic stages in Sonic Generations, my favorite out of the three is the Avatar stages with Modern Sonic being my least favorite because of certain parts of each stages where Sonic goes auto-pilot & he has a few QTEs for some reason. The bosses weren't all that great either. Boost, homing attack 3 times, rinse & repeat for most of them. I'd give it a 6/10. It's not a bad Sonic game but it's not a great Sonic game.

"I am a huge fan of Sonic from the Sega Genesis era even up to the ps3 and 360 Sonic Unleashed days. First of all this game is not like Sonic Mania the masterpiece released two months before it. With this said Sonic Forces should not be discounted. I like the avatar and all the cosmetic, gear and weapon options which I unlocked all in the daily missions. Additionally, the price of the game is about right being around $30 or less. If you like 3D Sonic games this game is very playable. Just don't go in thinking it is as deep as Sonic Unleashed, Generations or Colors. Visually the characters and levels look nice and some of the music was done well to the level of say Sonic Colors or Unleashed which in my opinion have some of the best modern Sonic music. The many in-game unlockables really works well for the game. Sonic Forces creatively uses daily and weekly challenges related to wearing and using certain gear, which brought a lot of variety as well. Additionally there are challenges for completing stages within a certain time. However, I do feel the levels are short and you can blast through them and just mash 'X' most of the time. Finally, this game seemed a bit like Sonic Heroes, Colors and Unleashed combined with your avatar able to use a variety of weapons as well as run, which in my opinion is very interesting. The Shadow the Hedgehog DLC was a nice bonus as well.",4,1,0,257,1107,30,382,14,9,62.45,9.11,7.92,12.01

"These are among my favorite games of all time, in fact Shenme II is number one on my list. I've played both games so much that I broke three Dreamcast GD-ROM drives. Needless to say, I am overjoyed that they received a re-release on modern console and PC systems. The design and aesthetics hold up well, even nearly 20 years after their initial releases. Anyone who has not played this franchise should know going in that the pacing is very slow. This is intentional. Yu Suzuki, the creator, wants the player to get immersed in the world, and few games have pulled this off so well. You truly feel like you are exploring real-life locations in the time period in which these games take place. This said, I have to be somewhat critical of this re-master. Despite a day-one patch, there are still many significant bugs. I've experienced glitched cutscenes where you cannot see the characters interacting. One of the QTE (quick time event) mini-games you can play refuses to register up on the directional pad, screwing me out of getting high scores. There is noticeable input lag when navigating some of the in-game menus. Some in-game sounds flat out refuse to play. I have my fingers crossed the developers will address these issues. One thing that cannot be fixed, however, is the quality of the audio. It sounds as low fidelity as it did on the Dreamcast. Unfortunately, the tracks could not be remastered without re-recording everything, so it's understandable. Just be prepared when you go in. Overall, the mere existence of this collection is a very positive thing. I just wish it had a little more 'time in the oven' so players would have a more polished experience.",4,5,0,302,1332,39,442,21,7,68.42,7.29,8.08,10.92
"Shenmue and Shenmue II are two of the greatest games of all time. Playing through the Shenmue series was and still is an absolutely incredible experience. Almost 20 years later, there is still nothing else quite like it. Therefore, it truly pains me to have to give this collection anything less than five stars. Unfortunately, this collection contains extremely shoddy and subpar ports of these two seminal classics. They are riddled with bugs and have extremely poor audio playback, with inconsistent volume levels, speech samples that are even lower quality than they were on the Dreamcast, randomly missing sound effects, and inaccurate music. The fantastic music in the Shenmue series is an integral part of the experience and it is a crime that Sega managed to mess it up so badly in this HD collection. Ultimately, I would still recommend this if it is your only way to play these games. However, I would highly advise playing the original Dreamcast/Xbox versions if at all possible. While Sega is actively patching this game, there is so much wrong with it that I doubt it will ever be on par with the original games that it is attempting to recreate. After waiting so many years for these two masterpieces to be released on modern platforms, it is a true shame that Sega was unwilling to give them the care that they deserve and do proper justice to Yu Suzuki's original work.",3,4,0,241,1123,32,369,11,12,55.06,11.02,10.25,14.07
"Shenmue is easily my favorite game of all time. I never grew up in the time when this game first came out in America in 2000 but first played it as a 15 year old back in 2009. Even at that young age emmeresed with games that are technically better looking, this old game on a system I never grew up with gripped me like no game has ever had and still never had to this day. Both of these games have stood the test of time with their deep level of immersion that I have not even felt with any game and with the care and craft that went into making the envoironments you explore. Shenmue 1 is easliy my favorite game of all time and 2 would easliy be in my top 10 and am definetly looking forward to 3 on August 27th 2019. Highly recommended if your tired of the same generic Sandbox games or Fortnight/PUBG clones that are the popular games out today.",5,3,0,168,676,12,225,6,12,65.11,11.13,6.8,14.06
"I always herd this game was one of the greatest games on the Dreamcast and you just HAD to play it. So when they announced 1 and 2 would be coming to the PS4 I decided to give it a spin. What can I say about Shenmue it's a story of a boy who witnesses his father getting killed and tries to go about getting his revenge. It starts off well enough but is quickly halted by cheesy voice acting wonky camera a few glitches that were not in the Dreamcast version. I have only played the first game so far. But I can tell you if you are a gamer who started playing games in the last few generations and are used to the modern conenicens of video games like a mini map or a way point telling you where to go or being able to skip cutscenes then you may be put off by this. But if you are a Yakuza fan and want to see how that series got started then I'd recommend you play this as Shenmue is the father to the Yakuza series. This game was a technical marvel at the time it achieved many things that games were not doing back then. Like day and night cycles weather effect fully voice acted story intelligent AI that went about there day being able to go in almost every building and interacting with items. Mini games inside a video game. If you want to experience a piece of gaming culture give this a go but if you are impatient easily frustrated by not knowing what to do or where to go if you are used to having your hand held then this is not for you.",4,3,1,292,1148,20,394,11,11,65.74,10.68,6.2,13.36
"It's great revisiting the Shenmue franchise. I would argue that it was well ahead of it's time and still arguably one of the best RPG/Fighter games of all time. The graphics have been cleaned up since the games original launch though not much needed to be done whereas Shenmue was a very beautiful game compared to other games that launched in it's day. I am disappointed though many details that made the game a great time waster was removed or made linear where it was previously non-linear. Checking dressers, cabinets, collecting cassettes, learning and the practice needed to master moves, and other elements. This takes from some of the replayability of the game and much of what made Shenmue so revolutionary. Considering the space available in the Blu-ray format and the technology available now, I can not understand why the game was scaled down. If you want to sell it as multiple disks to release it in its full glory, please do that. I enjoy the game despite the noticable differences from the original.",3,1,0,180,821,23,273,9,11,58.23,10.11,9.54,13.11
"First, I am a Dreamcast and Shenmue fan. I still own the originals of both. Here's the good and bad of the this updated compilation: THE GOOD: Classic tale of revenge. Wastes no time getting you roped into the story. The characters and environments are memorable. The story is engaging and it's easy to get sucked in for hours. The pacing is slow, but I find it as a comforting zen-like experience. I love that I can remote play on my Vita and enjoy it handheld throughout the house. The games don't seem to take too much HD space on my PS4 either, which is nice. THE BAD: In regards to the core game itself, the game and flow feels dated. Especially if you grew up on anything newer than PS2 era systems. These are basically just ports of a game engine that was released almost 20 years ago. Keep that in mind when it comes to graphics and textures. The controls pre-date the dual analog stick standard. So expect tank controls with minimal right analog support. The audio samples of the voice overs are not very good and you'll definitely notice it when you first play. The combat is based on old Virtua Fighter mechanics which are not great, but it gets the job done. There's not much combat anyway. In regards to the re-release efforts, I hit multiple cutscene glitches. During realtime cutscenes, the camera would change to some random static shot while the music and voiceovers play. Sometimes it's a static shot of a lamp or a static shot inches from a blank wall. I hit these bugs in less than an hour of play. I really hope they patch this soon. The main draw of the game is its ability to pull you in. But these cutscene glitches are immersion breaking. It's unfortunate because the original releases felt so polished. I think there's audio problems when running through the streets that was not present in the original. The sound of the foot steps randomly cuts out. I'm surprised they couldn't improve the NPC pop up. The popup may be worse than the original.",3,1,0,370,1562,37,526,30,5,74.05,6,6.62,8.93

"When this title was initially released on the Dreamcast I thought it was the greatest game of all time. Playing through it now I see how far games have come since then. It is a very slow day. In between tasks you frequently need to waste time wandering around, playing arcade games, drinking a soda, listen to the same few people say the same few things, etc. The combat is terrible! As are the controls. I barely remember not having 2 joysticks to use. The 3 stars comes from the nostalgia and terrible voice acting known from Japanese titles at this time. If you never played this you will hate it. If you played it before and remember it, you will likely enjoy some reminiscing.",3,1,0,125,542,10,172,10,6,77.74,5.52,7.33,8.2

Physical copy, so I could sell it back the following day. Cons: Could not use the pro controller. Can't go anywhere on the lake. Just the same location where you can move a little bit one way or another. Controls - Like above...not good, but not bad Some small fish seemed to fight harder than large ones. Graphics are okay at best Environment is very static Weak presentation. Game just seems thrown together. I took this game back a day or two later, and took my losses trading it in.

I've progressed to about Level 32 and I just began the majin buu series of the storyline ... it can be very hard to progress. I've gotten stomped by characters that I really didn't think would be such a headache to defeat...like the ginyu force series shouldn't have been as touch as it was ...

"I bought this because I had the strange urge to relive my Budokai for PS2 days. The combat is SWEET. You create your own Z fighter from all different races you'll recognize. The introduction is RIDICULOUS, as some of the first things you do to learn the controls is go Toe-to-toe as a new super saiyan Goku on Namek delivering a good spanking to Frieza. The game was developed to be... like an MMO of some sort I think? I don't know, I don't do anything with other players-- never see any anyways. This is a non-cannon excuse to make your own Z character, 'apprentice' under a famous character, learn all their moves, and legitimately play out your childhood fantasies of ascending through your race's power levels to save the galaxy. Only bad thing is the weird 'menu'/'lobby' between fights... you walk around in a non-combat, mmo-like 'town' with vendors and stuff. Just ends up being a little inconvenient in the end.",5,1,0,172,719,18,246,11,7,69.97,7.38,6.89,10.44

"This game is seriously addictive. The leveling system and reward systems are solid and fun to play around with. The storyline takes what I love about DBZ and gives it a whole new perspective. If I had one negative thing to say about it, it would have to be that they should have made the game more open in terms of free roaming. It would be nice to be able to explore the world a bit more and find new tasks outside of the small map they give you to roam around in. Otherwise an excellent game.",5,1,0,97,391,8,130,6,6,77.04,6.53,6.07,9.77
"Pros: Really entertaining to play with friends Went over the majority of the Sagas Multiple Races Multiple Skills Good amount of characters Cons: I didn't like that the transformation and charge up ability had to take up a skill slot, I feel as if it should of been a passive ability. I also feel you should of been able to cycle or choose any of the Saiyan levels, not just one while in combat. I also feel that you should of been able to use a fusion ability, and become like vegito without having to choose the vegito character to play as.",4,1,0,103,432,13,152,3,16,47.14,15.21,8,18.78

"it is a really good game best dragon ball game in a while but they are lacking characters for some reason it is ok to have 15 versions of Goku but no cell first or second form and I hate having to walk around the entire map it gets really annoying and also the drop rates for moves are ridiculous you can sit there and play the mission 25 times and still not get the move you are looking for. Also you can play as the main villain you have to buy the dlc and the third villain is not playable. maybe for the next dragon ball game they can leave the last gen consoles behind so we can use the full power of the Xbox One, PS4 and Pc. Hopefully with the next Dragon ball game they can add ALL of the characters and not a lot of versions of just some and make ALL of the villains playable without buying the dlc. What I like about the game is what they did with the story and parallel quest along with the character customization.",4,1,0,185,736,11,241,5,16,59.07,14.21,6.79,17.18
"As a DBZ fan I knew this title was a must have, I was not disappointed. Though there are some questionable design choices, then Hub world feels like a throwback to Phantasy Star Online, the actual gameplay is quite fun. Where this game really shines is the use of your custom created character, you participate in all of the biggest battles of the DBZ timeline. The story really integrates your character, its more than just retreading the same battles as you know them. Aside from the main story there are 60 or so side battles that can be played solo or online coop. On thing of note, I highly recommend you be a fan, if not I cannot imagine you will fully appreciate the game!",5,1,0,125,542,17,185,6,10,60.48,10,8.27,13.77

"Dragonball Xenoverse is pretty good, if you're a fan. The game takes cues from the previous Dragon Ball games and amps up the action, allowing for 3 vs 3 fights in full 3-Dimentional space. You're tasked with creating a new character at the start of the game, and you can choose between Saiyan, Earthling, Namekian, Buu's, and Frieza's race. The story is done cleverly enough by introducing two new characters who change pivotal moments in time throughout the Dragonball Z series. It's your job to stop these two and fix the timeline. Unfortunately for the game, much of the online features depend on the servers, which are down quite often. But, when things are going well, the main hub where quests and battle options are found, are packed with up to 200 players, making it feel reminiscent of an MMO. Overall, the grindy leveling system and server quality limit this game from being great.

"If you are a long time fan of Dragon Ball Z, this game is for you. If not, you might have a little trouble pushing through and finishing the game. It's a fantastic, visually stunning game, with a lot of bonus content besides the main story line to keep you busy. The achievements are average difficulty, noting too hard or weird to unlock. The game is great but could be better. The camera during some battles can be shaky and some of the villains are tough, but if you are a fan of DBZ, it won't matter as much since this is probably the best console game attached to the Dragon Ball franchise.",4,1,0,115,468,9,155,6,8,73.35,7.79,6.58,10.8

However this is more of an RPG fighter than Battle of Z's jump right in and play style. This game has some cool aspects to it like reliving some great DBZ moments, however the grinding and training aspects of the game are tedious and do not make for much fun. I think this game is for the most hardcore of DBZ fan because of all the grinding you must do to progress.",3,1,2,102,382,6,129,4,9,73.96,9.28,5.06,12.55

That's not to say that there aren't other DBZ games better than it, since that's not true. DBZ Budokai 3 and the Raging Blast games are certainly better. The gameplay takes a lot getting used to in this game, and there is a bit of grinding involved but once you do good it's a decently fun game.

"Rally car driving and physics are fantastic using a good force feedback wheel. I did have to change the wheel settings to correct the very loose steering the game had by default but once I got that dialed in I was good to go. Can't speak for using a controller but I've heard that works okay as well. Career modes are okay and more real world tracks would have been nice but the core driving experience is what makes this game great. Racing is very challenging even on the default medium difficulty setting but if you have the patience to learn every corner and nuance of a track, get your car setup right, adjust your driving to suit what type of car you are in (FWD/RWD/4WD), you will start leading the pack. Head-to-head 6 car racing in the officially licensed FIA World Rallycross Championship series is also great fun.",5,1,0,155,658,9,211,6,12,65.45,10.55,8.02,12.66

Onto Gears 5...this game is awesome. I'd say I'm about halfway through at this point. Graphics, sound (new home theater *drool*), and the Jack commands are great and add another layer to combat.

"I've followed Gears of War since the beginning. The story line is what hooked me in but the multi-player games keep me playing. The story line continues to amaze. I'm not a very good at PVP but I still love trying the different PVP games. Horde is where I excel as I'm a team oriented player. Horde concept in Gears 5 is basically the same as Gears 2,3,4 but adds character special skills and makes players themselves collect power, which used to be mainly the job of the scout. If you're into the Gears of War franchise, this is another great pick-up and if you haven't you're missing out.",5,1,0,119,463,7,157,7,6,77.96,6.61,5.34,9.15
"I enjoyed playing the Gears of War franchise since its start on the Xbox 360. However, like many franchises, the gameplay became repetitive and the story, especially in Gears of War: Judgment, lacked heart and emotion. Upon hearing about Gears 5, I grew curious about returning to play in this franchises once more. Spoiler-free, the story is amazing and hints a continuation. In short, it is a roller coaster of heart and emotion that I have grown to expect from the Gears franchise. Multiplayer returns, and it is a fun time to play. It is very forgiving to new players of the franchise and old veterans alike. There is a perk system in place that rewards players to access different type of weapons for the specific class of character you are playing as in multiplayer, which is great. Progression is documented through a leveling up system. There is no season pass this year, and The Coalition, game publisher, promises to add different types of levels, modes, especial events, and characters that can be earned through playing the game. There are micro transactions hidden in Gears 5 and are used to buy basic skins for weapons and characters that can be earned by playing the game. Overall, I am very content with my purchase of Gears 5 and feel that it is a must for any fan of the franchise and Xbox owner.",5,1,0,233,1053,31,346,12,10,61.5,9.51,9.25,13.09

"The game is a bit clunky but at its price drops under 30 bucks its worth picking up. This is basically an action stealth game set in the FRONT MISSIONS universe. Most of the previous games have been Mech Sci fi based RPG or strategy games. Or mech action games. This one tries something very different. If your a fan of the front mission setting. Pick this up.

I definitely recommend you Google for cheat codes. I found a lot of weapons and cheats which I will use to make the game easier and more fun. I found GTA for the PS2 much easier to use.

The real reason the game was delayed had NOTHING to do with development, both versions were completed almost a year ago, the delay was with how to fit it on the hd-dvd's limited space.

"I like most gamers fell into the hype for GTA4. I was pump when I first inserted the game in which was fun for the first few missions, but then became very repetitive.

While the missions have to deal with the same things as the previous games, they are much better because of the variety and especially the wonderful graphics. I also think that the addition of online play caught the attention of many people when it was announced and it certainly didn't disappoint! Even though the producers added the online feature they certainly didn't forget about adding to the storyline because it was better than ever! Check out this game the next time you go shopping.

Pros 1.Awasome story lines 2.Kill whoever you want...just dont get caught 3.Well worth the money for the game...will keep you playing well after you've completed the game. Cons 1. Not suitable for kids under 12-13 because of excessive violance, Prostitution, Drugs/Alchol referances. Not really something you want a growing child to be around. 2.Has alot of cussing and racial referances. Also not something you want a growing child to go to school and repeat words. hope this is helpfull...",5,4,1,133,547,13,184,15,3,80.79,4.19,5.04,7.46

This game has so many issues including the lack of customization, even with the brightness game option turned all the way up I still can't read the display on the in-game cell phone unless I turn my tv brightness up as well, lack of vehicles (the series has been going for some time now so you would think the vehicles would be spectacular although the helicopter is a nice addition) and perhaps my biggest issue with this abomination is that the game isn't formatted to fit all screens and doesn't have a display option to change it. Overall I would still recommend it to a friend becuase a lot of people love this series but I would likely advise them to hold off for Saints Row 2.",2,2,1,176,711,13,236,3,27,33.85,23.11,7.45,26.42
"From GTA3 this has certainly improved in every single aspect of the game. Once you start you cant stop, you will really enjoy the missions and story since the main character has a more interesting story in this chapter of GTA4. The game also allows you to be more involved in your social life to make it more real and at the same time this also will help you achieve more in your adventure since you might meet some well conected people along the way. All this and I haven't even played the multiplayer. This game has previously had a decent replay value just for running around the city creating chaos but now you also have the social life, kind of like the Sims, as well as different types of multiplayer games. It has a value of more than $60 if you compare what you usually get for $60 with other games. if you are already thinking about it, just go and get it, trust me you will love the game and continue to enjoy it for a long time.

And to top it off you can't play online! Whenever you try it says you can't find the server. Lame, very lame. I've had no problems with the 360 version getting online.

"While It is true that the Xbox 360 version does have Downloadable Content on the way next year the game itself is what you need to grab no matter what system. The pros of the 360 version is the downloadable content but thats about it depending on your taste. The Playstation 3 version has softer colors making it seem more realistic while the 360 version has brighter colors making it seem a little like previous GTA's with the comic book look. in addition the Playstations version of Liberty City where the game is set is more alive than the 360's it has more people, cars and more lifelike reflections than it's 360's counter part. This comes from the Playstation 3's outstanding core processor being able to do all these things at the same time without slowing how the game looks.

I'm sure they were going for the 'realistic effect' saying things in the board meeting room like ' its should be more on the natural plan of sight like real driving. Hey genius developers (IT'S A GAME, NOT REAL LIFE). Games are meant for having fun and making you feel like you just can't wait to get back on the game when you are away. Let me tell ya.

It has many graphical glitches and framerate issues that are nonexistant in the 360 version, which is already complete. It has been stated in previews that the 360 version has more vibrant graphics and better lighting, while the PS3 version looks bland and washed out. Also, the 360 version will be getting an exclusive expansion pack that will add 20 hours of new gameplay. The PS3 version will not be getting this.

Most of you that are reading this have a PS3 and can play PS2 games, so why dont you just get Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for PS2 (It is going to be the same!). The only difference from the PS2 versions are GRAPHICS. So go ahead and pay $60 for graphics money wasters. If you have a PS2, buy that version. If you disagree with me, fine.

"Overall I think GTA4 is mostly a good game the only reason I give it a 5 star rating is for the story mode. Other than that the graphics are a 'been there done that' kinda feel to them. They don't really ever push the PS3 to it's limits like COD4 or GT5 prologue does. The dualshock 3 makes this game that much more interesting. DS3 adds something missing from most games depth and a sense of being there. I love the minimal load screens (you can goto any building thats interactive and just walk into or out of it) The mission load screens are unadvoidable. Just a little side note: this game takes a HUGE chunk of HDD space (5 gigs) so have little to nothing on the HDD before installing gta4. The helicopter flying leaves something to be desired such as a joystick accessory for the ps3 (you know just like a pc one) It is really hard to fly one of those things. The sixaxis controls are goofy and might as well be turned off. I was mostly let down with the graphics more than anything.",5,0,1,191,780,12,255,10,8,74.5,7.61,6.66,10.15

"The one flaw that ruins this game is that if you die, you have to start the entire game all over again (Much like Rogue Stormers). I am not sure why developers think it is fun playing the same level over and over, but if I don't feel like I am making progress in a game, I am not having fun. As far as the character movements and combat. Everything is fluid and responsive. It has the retro feel of the old castlevania games. The graphics, unfortunately, aren't great but for this type of game they are passable. I believe there is around 12 levels of this game. And if you die on say level 10, you have to start again at level 1. You are allowed to keep some things like gold, but who cares. You just lost all your progress by dying. And yes, I know some players love a challenge. Well, have different difficulty levels then. The hardcore gamers can brag when they beat the game on a higher difficulty, but why punish the casual gamer that just wants to have some fun exploring these levels and fighting things? And this is coming from someone that has finished all the Dark Souls games. At least in those games, when you died, you didn't lose progress on every area you explored or things you unlocked. Either way, if you think you will like replaying the same levels over and over again, then enjoy! For me, I rather be having a root canal.",1,1,8,257,1053,15,346,17,6,77.59,6.19,6.33,8.38
"This game is full of glitches. I cant believe this made it past quality control at Ubisoft, because this is completely unacceptable for a $40 game. Music and sounds are missing, the rules of the game dont function correctlyits a total mess. Here's a list of all of the issues: Missing sounds: Bankrupt whistle when you land on Bankrupt 1/2 Car Horn when you land on 1/2 Car Tag Solved puzzle music cue The iconic 'ding' when letters light up blue on the puzzle board The speed-up music during round 4 The bell sound that should be heard when the final spin graphic is being displayed Bugs: The game breaks randomly and the million dollar wedge, prize wedges, 1/2 car tags, and gift tags just stop coming off the wheel after a round or 2--including during the final spin where ALL extras on the wheel should be removed The wild card and gift tags will re-generate on the wheel not just visually; they can be claimed again and again. This is NOT how the game is played--once these are off the wheel, they are off for the entire rest of that game, with the exception of the 1/2 car tags which should replenish. Update 1.0.1 that was released, BROKE the flippers. Depending on where the wheel lands, the flipper will register the adjacent wedge, that WAS NOT LANDED ON. The background lights that flash when you solve a puzzle, at some point just get stuck flashing, even when normal play resumes the next round (it happens in the bonus round as well) The debounce when hitting buttons is poor or non-existent. There have been many times when you push a button to solve the puzzle, it shows you the screen to start inputting text, but then immediately jumps to the next player to spin, as if you forfeit your solve. After playing a round, if you want to go into the options to change the prize wedge or the gift tags, the wheel doesn't spin to the correct places, so you cannot see the changes you are making. The game has been out for weeks with these reported bugs and not a peep or update from Ubisoft.",1,12,0,380,1582,22,494,13,13,67.19,11.15,7.67,14.01

While going from Dishonored 1 and 2 can be a bit jarring and disorienting (different mechanics, abilities, scenery, and graphics), going from 2 to Death of the Outsider is super easy. Death of the Outsider is set in Karnaca, and so far I've visited at least 2 places that are familiar to me from Dishonored 2. Billie has different abilities from Emily (or Corvo, or even Daud for that matter), but that doesn't make this game any less enjoyable. If anything it makes it more interesting as a lot of Billie's abilities are unlike that which we've seen before. For example, Billie's Foresight is completely different from Dark Vision, in the aspect that she astral projects while time is frozen, giving you a chance to look over your surroundings. Even when being attacked by guards. There's been a couple of times where I've thought 'Man, if I had any of the other's powers, this would be a breeze' and I think that's why Billie's abilities are so different.

It's not at all serious, it has the right amount of competitiveness, and it's just an overall enjoyable and addicting game.

"I love and enjoy the Plants vs. Zombies franchise. Yeah, PvZ2 is not the greatest sequel you could ask for, but Garden Warfare is a hilarious take on modern first and third person shooters. The game is just great overall fun. Playing as the Plants or Zombies provides hours of entertainment and lots of unlockables. Yes, this a multiplayer only game, but I feel it is better for that and maybe that was the point? Multiplayer is great, community is great and everyone just has a good time. Not a lot of skill is required to play the game, but if you are able to master one of the classes, you can dominate a match. Another great feature is splitscreen co-op. My wife and I use this all the time and have a great time together playing. She loves Plants vs Zombies, but does not play shooters at all. She was able to pick this game up right away.

"This edition comes in a Sega Genesis style clamshell. The dimensions are the same as the original clamshell cases, although maybe a little thinner of a spine, and the quaility seems pretty close as well. Instead of a Sega game cartridge, however, there is a foam insert with the Switch cartridge nested inside. It also comes with a fold out poster and one full color manual containing Aladdin in one half - and if you flip the manual 180 degrees and flip it over - you have the Lion King Manual. The manual is of similar paper quality as a Genesis game manual. The case even comes with the hanger on the top. This does NOT come with a Nintendo Switch case inside, so it will not match the rest of your Switch collection - if that is of concern to you. There is also a Super Nintendo variation of this retro edition, in which the cart comes in a recessed cardboard inlay much like the original SNES carts did - no Nintendo Switch case in that variation either. Both games are on one cart, and if you want a review of the actual game/port/emulation/etc; there are plenty of reviews on the listing for the standard version of this game. Overall, I recommend this edition to people who loved these games when they were kids (who played on Genesis), and to people who enjoy physical media and like getting manuals with their games. If you can, buy this in person as the clear plastic outer film that holds the cover sheet can become damaged fairly easily. If you want to see it unboxed, I have a video on YouTube - as may other people, and check it out that way.",5,2,0,288,1233,36,420,12,11,59.1,10.98,8.14,14.6

"I've tested this on both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. While it's not as impressive with the PS3 version, the game in general is an absolute blast. After quite a streak of unimpressive and repetitive story lines, Sonic Unleashed finally breaks away from tradition. New characters and a whole new circumstance with the same old die hard attitude make the game fast paced, full of action, and fun for people of all ages. The music, as usual, does not disappoint in the least. The only disappointment to the true fans of this game would be side characters are in short supply, and unlike usual, play a very minuscule role in the plot development and progress. With that in mind, the newly introduced character for this story fills that void quite well. There have been some complaints that this game is too easy and boring. Please realize that most of the people writing reviews like this give the game less than an hour to play, and as per usual, this game gives a tutorial for the first short bit on how to play like many others so that you can get used to the new controls. One stage in this game took me an hour and 10 minutes to complete racing through it and I still earned a C ranking. Anyone who had played fully through this game in comparison to the older Sonic games will be glad to tell you that by the end the difficulty has really stepped up a notch. I'd give this game 5 out of 5 stars. Sega finally took their time with development on a game, and this is a great end result to their work.",5,5,0,286,1197,30,390,13,10,69.14,9.08,7.46,13

It features 2 modes perfect and append. With append you are able to play the original game before starting a new game with all the AWESOME added content. With perfect mode you begin the game with the added content from the beginning. Anyone that has any interest in jrpg's needs this in their collection. If you're new to jrpg's I definitely recommend starting with this because your first experience with jrpg's should be memorable, beautiful, fun and authentic.",5,2,0,151,676,21,234,10,8,60.41,8.59,8.56,11.6
"Ive only played a few hours into the game but the fact that it deals with time travel and having the option to change it reminds me of Chrono Trigger. It puts me in a state of nastolgia. The voice acting is great and the pixel art is even better. The combat is turned based and allows you to perform combos for higher damage and xp. Did I mention this version came with an art book and stickers!",5,1,0,78,313,1,102,5,6,80.37,5.92,5.9,6.75
"As many already know, this is a remake of a DS game released about 7 years ago. For newcomers that love RPG games, I would totally recommend this new version over the original DS since it's improved in many ways (it has voice acting, more save slots, the graphics look better, and there's new content/sidequests/a new character). For those that already played the original, there's still fun to be had in this remake; mainly the extra content/sidequest/new character; and it's in my opinion, a good reason to revisit this game! I'm 10 hours into it and loving it (even more than the first time I played it). Also, I would like to note that the original localization effort done by Atlus when the DS game was released was great; but this time it was taken one step further with the voice acting; which is pretty good and compliments well the work done earlier. Additionally, keep in mind that the launch copies come with a nice cardboard box, an artbook, and decal artwork that includes the characters of the game. So I would recommend getting your copy while supplies last if you want to get those. If you haven't tried the game before and you're hesitant if this game will be your cup of tea, there's a free demo in the Nintendo eShop; and you can transfer your progress to the real game if you decide to buy it (which I did).",5,2,1,253,1044,25,357,8,14,55.36,13.39,7.53,16.6
"I just bought this game on 2/19/2018!! Will have to give kudos to Atlus for picking up this game and remaking it for the newer system. Game comes along with new additional contents, DLC, art and more! For those who are purchasing the limited 'launch' edition, an artbook and sticker sheet are included which are package inside the box. Friendly mode makes it easy for new players to enjoy game which helps focus more on the story vs normal and hard mode. For those who have played this game before, you're welcome to play the append mode which have additional stories or re-visit the original story line with updated graphics and voicing! Def. a must have JRPG game! Advice: if you're not sure if the game is right for you, you may dl the demo on the DS shop! The demo version allows you to save your progress onto your SD card which you may transfer /load the file onto the full version (when purchase) and OH! in demo they give some freebie in game healing items too.. so even if you plan on buying the full game, PLAY DEMO ANYWAY! :)))))",5,1,0,196,812,10,263,13,6,78.01,6.12,6.6,8.07

It was 3 am at this point so I decided to call it a night and download it in the morning. Well, 1230 rolled around and I still didn't get a code, had to call in and have them expedite it. Finally got the code about 10 minutes after the phone call, but even the woman on the phone said it takes up to 24hrs to get codes. I could have walked into a store, purchased the card from a gaming section and come back faster then waiting all this time. Just know that if you buy digital content from DotCom it will take extra time, if you are in a hurry to play, swing into a brick and mortar.",3,8,2,201,782,9,252,9,9,78.1,7.91,5.75,10.72
"While the RTS genre has largely been replaced in popularity by the MOBA genre, I'm glad to see Microsoft release this title against the dying popularity of its genre. The game is a solid RTS, though it lacks the trifecta (per se) of the StarCraft series, lending more to a focus on Leader Powers (powers you can use from your camera perspective that target anywhere you want that aren't tied to a unit's action) than playing to your 'race's' strengths. Since there are only two sides, and both share a large portion of their unit strategies with only a handful of real differentiation, large-scale (and ultimately longer match) battles get to be a bit on the boring side. This is remedied by several modes, opting for quick matches of sheer strategy and all-out chaos, but I do only recommend fans of the RTS genre to give this game a chance. If you're not into this sort of game, this one won't change your mind!",4,2,0,172,721,14,247,5,16,50.43,14.77,7.99,17.02
"I'd rate Halo Wars 2 as a buy after the first price drop. It's got a great mix of content for RTS veterans and RTS newcomers alike. Storywise, Halo Wars 2 seems a bit too brief of a campaign, but the missions are extremely varied in a way that rivals Starcraft, and the cutscenes are some best looking cutscenes I've ever seen in gaming. Multiplayerwise, Halo Wars 2 really shines as you have a great mix of Online Co-Op, verses, and Firefight modes, coupled with offline Skirmish modes against AI. Blitz is a fun game mode for quick games, but the pay to win microtransactions in that mode are going to really prevent a lot of people from playing on an even footing. (I'd stick to blitz firefight in that regard, as it cuts the pay to win element out entirely) If you love Halo and RTS, defintely buy it at launch. If you aren't quite sold, wait until you can get the ultimate edition at a better price. 343 has a good track record of post-launch support off of Halo 5, (Free maps, tendency to listen to the community for post-launch features and updates) and as good as this game is at the moment, it will be a great addition to your game collection in 6 months when the post-launch DLC campaign, maps, and leaders arrive.",4,2,0,236,961,24,332,8,13,57.88,12.52,7.14,15.87
"My very first RTS ( Real Time Strategy ) game was Halo Wars. I went into that game not knowing anything about it, and not even knowing if I would like it at all, but as it turns out I absolutely LOVED it. So Halo Wars 2 was a no brainer to me, it was a day one buy. If you know what an RTS is and have experience in this genre of games then you know what to expect here. Base building, troop development, land and air, vehicle & armor , weapon development etc etc etc............ then of course moving troops and etc from one place to the other to complete the objectives of the game . Sounds simple and boring? LOL, it is not, you will have multiple things happening at once, not all the time but it will happen, you may have troops engaging a target and more somewhere else engaging some enemy somewhere else and then your base comes under attack and you have to mange what is happening there as well.. Don't think this will be to much to handle for you, the game is set up in a way that you can quickly move from one engagement to the other very very quickly and seamlessly. Most RTS games will be found on PC, and few have been developed for Console, but the way the game has been tailored for controller control instead of mouse and keyboard it is absolutely outstanding. the controls are simple and easy to remember and understand, allowing quick response for what ever situation you find yourself in during the game. Story - The Game begins as the crew from The Spirit of Fire awaken from cryo sleep due to a distress signal from an instillation called the ARK. Upon deploying a Spartan team to the Ark to investigate the signal, the team encounters the Atriox, a Brute that has risen through the trials of war to become the most brutal and fierce leader of a rebel covenant faction. It is now up to you to stop this terrible threat and save the galaxy and the human race.. This game will also impact the Halo 6 story line, which is very interesting because the original Halo Wars had no impact at all on the games that came after it. I love this idea and upon playing the upcoming Halo 6 title I will remember and be able to reflect on what happened during Halo Wars 2, and why the things happening in Halo 6 are happening . Halo Wars was a game that was set in the Halo universe but had nothing to do with the main line Halo titles and the Master Chief, and that is not the case with this game and the upcoming Halo 6 main line installment.. What a great idea, I absolutely love it and absolutely cannot wait for the inevitable Halo 6 release in 2018. Graphics - Absolutely gorgeous, detail everywhere, you know you are playing a Halo game, there is no doubt. The cut scenes are absolutely AMAZING, and the original Halo Wars was no slouch in this department either, but DANG they are beautiful in this title, and just help immerse you into this game and the Halo universe. Voice Acting - The cast in this game are top notch as you would expect from a AAA game release. There are a few characters throughout the campaign that are better than others, but that is to be expected just like any other game or movie, but over all the voice acting is exceptional to further your game immersion. Sound - If you have played past main line Halo titles you will be right at home here, from the sounds of gunfire to the pop of plasma grenades, it's all here. The Scorpion tanks, Warthogs and all Covenant vehicles sound absolutely great and just like they should and are definitely what you remember. Also just like all Halo titles this entry has an excellent orchestral sound track that's just puts you into the Halo universe and keeps you there, simply amazing.. Conclusion - This is an AMAZING title for everyone not just the Halo fan base, there is just so much fun to be had here. In my opinion this game is well worth the purchase price, and I urge everyone to pick it up. Solid 5 out of 5",5,1,0,728,3070,75,1030,28,12,60.75,11.25,7.86,14.52

"Being a long time fan of BioWare's Dragon Age series, this game does not disappoint the roleplay gamer. There are a few bugs here and there, mostly in making sure you're not moving around too much when the game is trying to save as it runs the risk of crashing. But as far as game-play, story, character development, and overall badassery, this game is beyond perfect. The score is brilliantly produced to get the dragon-slaying blood pumping, the dialogue is full of wit and heart and information, and the combat techniques are incredibly easy to pick up on. Whether you're a master tactician or an in-the-moment fighter, Dragon Age: Inquisition is both challenging and rewarding. There are just enough moments of humor to ease the harder decisions. and plenty of hard choices to discover who among your allies is the most morally conscious. The world of Thedas is vast, truly encompassing the enormity of Origins and DA2 without losing the charm and appeal that we were first introduced in the predecessors. The companions are bright, eloquently designed, and regardless of their personal and moral standings, you can't help but love them regardless. I would definitely consider this to be one of the absolute best games of 2014, if not of the last ten years all together (but, perhaps, I am biased). 100/10, I definitely see this game becoming a major fan favorite, as well as having replay-value for years to come.",5,1,0,251,1136,36,382,11,12,54.92,11.27,9.52,14.86

"This game truly shows how far the Batman Arkham franchise has come. The visual effects of this game are stunning, it is set in Christmas in Gotham two years after Zero Year and the snow is a wonderful backdrop, the characters all have their breath visible, everything you would expect to see if you were watching an actual movie with real live actors. From the very first boss battle, I was hooked, it took me back to all the challenging boss battles I remember from the Nintendo/N64/Sony PS1 days where you cursed because it was actually a CHALLENGE to beat the boss. All the normal Arkham things are found here, Batarang, Detective Mode, Batwing, etc. Because it is set so early, Commissioner Gordon is Detective Gordon still (which I liked that little detail they stuck to, they could have screwed that one up). The cast of characters is phenomenal. So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Here is my opinion why it did not earn that last star from me. Roger Craig Smith voices Batman, and he just doesn't do it as well as Kevin Conroy has done Batman for so long. Mark Rolston as Deathstroke just doesn't pull it off, they should have recast Ron Perlman to reprise the role from The Flashpoint Paradox or Fred Tatasciore from Young Justice. I will say one casting that was well done, Nolan North as the Penguin was fantastic. The other reason I gave it 4 stars, they screwed up Copperhead and totally changed that character. This truly was a departure from DC cannon and it bothered me. Do not let those issues though dissuade you from buying what is possibly thus far the best game in the Batman Arkham franchise.",4,6,1,298,1299,29,420,14,10,66,9.34,8.44,12.41
"If you like the other two arkham titles you will like this one too. You cant tell they had a new game developer develop this one. You can hardly tell the difference of the new voice actors. Some of the boss fights are great and some are disappointing. There is more detective crime scene stuff which is good because Batman is suppose to be the 'worlds greatest detective.' This adds a new multiplayer game thats entertaining enough.",5,2,0,77,348,8,107,6,7,76.25,5.81,8.47,9.29
"Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are my top 2 favorite games... ever. City is my #1 and Asylum is #2. If you are new to these games, here is what you need to know... The Arkham series is the BEST superhero game series ever made to this day. These are openworld games and the main gameplay is divided into two categories. 1) brawling with groups of thugs and 2) predator challenges. The brawling is amazing... the combat system starts out very simple but as you progress through the game you learn new moves and you quickly discover that the combat system is very very deep and can be as complicated as you want it to be. The predator csequences are stealth based gameplay where you are confronted with between 5 and 10 armed thugs who roam about a large room who batman takes down one by one. Again, this system is very deep and there are countless ways to approach each situation. However... Arkham origins is the 3rd game in the series and this was made by a different video game developer than the first two games. Arkham Origins tries to improve on the first two games in several ways, some which work and some which dont. While I didnt find Arkham Origins as enjoyable as the first two games... I still did find it enjoyable. So in summary... if you have not played Asylum or City then go out and play those NOW. If you really enjoyed Asylum and City then go ahead and pick up Origins and Im sure you will be glad you did. But if you played Arkham cCity and did not like it too much then I'm sure that this title is not worth your time.",4,2,0,292,1208,33,409,20,6,73.52,6.63,6.5,10.36
"Similar game play to the first 2 games, which gives you a ton to do even after the main story mode ends. Several great references that fans of the comics and other Batman lore will enjoy. The multiplayer has been unsuccessful for me so far. I spent 20-30 minutes trying to get into a game without success and after getting into a few lobbies only to be kicked out, i gave up. Thanks to this and a few other extremely difficult trophies, I will not be attempting a platinum on this one.

"I haven't had as much time to play Origins as I did when I played the other two in the series, but when I do get to sit down to play it's nostalgic and refreshing. The game is full of action and the pacing seems to be solid throughout. Opportunities for exploration beyond the primary storyline are as abundant as they were in Arkham City (if not more so) and things work almost exactly like the other two, although the interface seems to be a bit less easy to get used to. I haven't finished the game yet, but I can already tell where things are headed just by the easter eggs--the creators of these games have really done a great job appealing to the hard core fans with those sorts of drops.

"I've been playing the Just Cause series since the first game was released. LOVED JC2, and enjoyed JC3, even though it had some issues. Just Cause 4 is a MESS. There is SO much wrong with this game, I wouldnt be able to get to it all here. (Google problems, and you'll find them). My biggest issues with this game arent visual, its the gameplay. JC2/3 worked because it was fun running around and blowing things up. JC4 isnt a whole lot of fun doing that. Its the most fun in the game, but its not as fun as 2/3. The world is large, and there is a LOT of land area. But that isnt necessarily a good thing. The world seems lifeless and dead. JC2/3 both had an 'alive' feeling, and beauty to the world(s), which JC4 just doesnt have. There are insane restrictions on ammunition, a weapon drop, drops with only 2 magazines. So youre constantly swapping out weapons from enemies or calling in nee drops. Gets old VERY fast. The 'busy work' they have you do in this game is boring, easy, and tedious. The developers took away liberating settlements!! That was the best part of JC2/3! Now there are settlements to blow stuff up in, but theydont count towards anything but Chaos points. You cant blow up bridges, or trains (easily). Enemy AI isnt the best, theyre quite stupid (flying/driving into random stuff duringnon-fighting times), but when you're fighting them, they are on their game, and there are TONS of them. It can make things quite difficult at first. But you learn to play in a style that works. If you must buy this game, wait until its $20 or under. And even then, i wouldnt say its worth it. Fins a used copy of JC2 or 3 and play those. JC2 is the best of the series, but JC3 was tons of fun for me to play, especially with the rocket boosted wingsuit (which JC4 also doesnt have). Save your money. PS - makes me sad to post such a poor review of a game I've been eagerly awaiting. :(",1,2,0,364,1458,22,472,31,4,85.22,4.29,5.23,7.11

"Rage 2 is bombastic fun with little considerstion for story, having any semblance of deep character relationships or a memorable open world. It's still serious fun until about 8 hours in, when the game make you grind tedious and repetitive side missions just to progress the main story. Up until that point though, the combat feels like if Doom (2016) was a cover shooter, and that was amazing to play and learn how to combo actions and skills together for massive carnage. Rage 2 is a good pickup when on sale or if you really have $60 to burn and no other games under consideration.",3,3,0,106,468,12,158,4,13,53.84,12.33,9.04,15.13
"My review is based on about 4-5 hours of play and from what I've seen so far the game is better than I expected. It's a little slow at first but gets better as you acquire more powerful weapons, abilities and powers. It does require a bit of searching to find all the good stuff but is worth it making the game more enjoyable. The graphics and sound are excellent but the characters look a little cartoony when seen up-close. The weapons are varied and have a nice feel while the driving is more than adequate for it's intended purpose. All in all, a good shooter to hold me over until Doom Eternal arrives.",4,2,0,119,481,11,162,6,8,71.53,8.21,6.47,11.63
"The shooting in Rage 2 is like a slightly wacky version of any one of the more recent Id Software titles, so it's exceptional. The driving is a bit slow, but also feels fun throughout the game. Graphically, the game is impressive on an Xbox One X, but only runs at 30fps on the S or original (as opposed to 60fps/1080p on the X). Its gameplay loop is most like a Far Cry, but I'm not sure the structure is as polishedbut who cares? The shooting is what you're here for, and I'd compare it to Doom or Wolfenstein II in terms of overall quality and fun factor.",4,2,0,113,433,9,152,5,8,70.1,9.1,5.42,12.23
"Rage 2 has really impressed me. I've heard mixed things about but overall I've heard it's a lot of fun. I totally agree after spending some time with it.

"Art direction they chose for the environment is great, the wide variety of colors from the swamps to rain forest like and desert areas looks great. This game is very light on story, so if you're looking for a story driven shooter, you'll probably be disappointed.

"One big problem I have is that the marketing makes the game out to be a wild and wacky spaz fest of nonstop gunplay and explosions. So far it feels more like a snooze fest much of the time. You drive around in barren wasteland to get to the next area where anything is happening. The game is also full of glitches. It isnt a good time to have NPC audio cut out and then be prompted to answer a question that was never asked. Maybe that kind of thing could be patched out at least. Now the controls: I played and played with the aim sensitivity and couldnt find anything that felt good.

Lots of treasure to find and crazies to kill. The menus are clunky until you get it all figured out. Ranger powers are cool. A niche game if ever I played one. If you like this game, I highly reccomend you play Mad Max on either PS4, XB1 or PC. Awesome game!",4,1,0,107,425,6,142,10,3,83.7,4.24,4.79,6.52

This game is a lot of fun. The graphics are great, they really capture the big fight atmosphere. The roster is enormous - you can pick pretty much any fighter that's fought in UFC and isn't under contract to another company (no Brock Lesnar then, unfortunately). It's a pretty easy game to pick up and play - the striking is a ton of fun, and I enjoy the animations for big hits and takedowns. My two complaints: -For a MMA game, tapping out someone is almost impossible. Submissions are six-step process that can be pretty easily blocked at multiple points. This really needs to be simplified for future games because it breaks immersion (so many submissions happen in a flash). -I know EA Sports for 'realism,' but future games should allow openweight fights. I would have loved for my heavyweight created fighter to be able to go against Conor McGregor, for example.",4,1,0,193,845,21,279,10,9,64.95,9,8.41,12.07

"I've been a fan of the Dead or Alive series since the Dreamcast version of DOA2 in 2000. Since then, I have seen the series have its ups and downs. I was a little hesitant when DOA6 was revealed because I wasn't a fan of part 5 in the series. I am happy to say that DOA6 is a return to the foundations that made this fighting series great, to begin with! As expected, the visuals are simply stunning for a DOA game. What I appreciate is that they added visual damage to the characters. The damage doesn't have any effect on the gameplay, it's just a nice touch. The mechanics of this fighter are tight and are welcoming to newcomers while veterans will feel right at home with the quick reflex blocking and throwing counters. I could write an entire chapter on the interworkings of the fighting mechanics but it's fun for the player to discover this for themselves. Learning to master these characters is streamlined in the training features. Don't understand how to perform a move? Simply have the game give you a tutorial, learn it and then easily return to where you left off in the previous mode. If I had any complaints, it would be with the stage designs. While some are gorgeous and are multitiered, there are others that fall flat. DOA2 and DOA4 had some of the best stage interactions in my opinion. But this complaint isn't a deal breaker by any means. The online component is good and so far, I haven't encountered lag or disadvantages. But for me, DOA6 is a couch fighter that I play with friends and guests that come over. There's a lot of excitement when played this way. At the end of the day, I think you will enjoy DOA6 for a long time to come. With a slew of fighter games being released, I think you will enjoy having this in your collection.",4,1,0,335,1395,27,455,21,7,75.74,6.66,6.83,9.6

"Hey Everyone, I wanted to finish the game before giving a review so now that I have finished it, here goes: The game is a lot of fun for the powers and combat. I like how the game gives you choices throughout the storyline. The missions are interesting at some points but I started to feel like all the battles were just fillers. I went the evil path and it was VERY easy to defeat all the bosses with the powers I leveled up. Some people online have said it is harder for the final boss if you are majorly leveled up but I found that wasnt the case. I found it was relatively easy and never even used the health/stamina/blood syringes that you can create for a boost. I was really surprised. Maybe it will be harder for a good play through? Anyways, the critics are correct that there are glitches at some points during the game and the loading screens can be ridiculous in length and bountiful. Other than that, it wasnt bad. I dont have an internet connection so I didnt download the updates/patches so my game probably was one of the few lucky vanilla versions to escape the bad glitches of freezing frames and game crashes. The conversations can get a little bit tedious as you are playing but it was interesting to hear about the characters stories. Maybe wait a little bit to buy until they fix all of the glitches the game has. Unless you get lucky like me, install the game and play offline the whole time making sure you dont connect your console to the internet until you are done playing the game.",4,2,0,284,1206,24,401,14,9,66.79,8.98,7.71,11.49
"This game was created from the same developers who worked on Life is Strange. Its a cool game that lasted about 25-30 hours for me which included completing about 60% of the sidequests. The story is interesting but the gameplay can be tough especially if you try not to kill any of the important NPCs. The fighting system is a bit clunky but doable. It was definitely fun to juggle as to who to kill or leave as is to complete their sidequests fully.",4,2,0,85,360,11,123,5,8,67.16,8.12,7.36,11.98

"I am enjoying progressing the story to see what unfolds in Dr. Reid's unlife. The game is a combination of dialogue driven interactions, finding collectables, and basic combat. You can opt out of some or skip to rush through most if you'd prefer. There are ways to make the game easier or harder by feeding or not, waiting longer to level up, and upgrading powers and weapons. There is one (autosave) game per playthrough, but dying means regeneration to try again (but at cost of supplies). Ultimately this seems to be a game of reasonable length that I will be playing again to try for different outcomes. I read online about 15 hour storyline but 20-30 to really explore; with replay value I think it's worth the cost.",5,2,0,132,572,17,200,8,8,61.91,8.72,7.89,11.75

The story and the characters are both well executed and unique the only flaws I see with the game are; combat is a little simplified for a game of this play-style and you are unable to fast-travel across the relatively large map. All in all good game, and anyone looking for a more story driven game where your choices carry weight and stay with you throughout the game I recommend trying this game out.",4,1,0,140,583,12,193,4,16,54.68,14.33,7.84,17.43
"Vampyr is a tremendous achievement considering the budget developers, DONTNOD Entertainment, had to work with. The graphics I would say are a solid 7.5 with faces being more around 8.5/9. It's London and the environment portrayed in Vampyr that makes the game shine visually. The story is engaging and forces the player to make meaningful decisions that hold consequences. The dialogue with citizens within the game can begin to be too much at times, but the information and knowledge gained on them is interesting and intriguing enough that I went through full interactions with them to get the most information I could.

"FULL REVIEW: linklink calls Vampyr a AA production. While true that the game has rough spots, its overall polish is greater than several AAA titles seen this year. I expect nothing less than stellar of Dontnod when it comes to writing. They have a knack for creating an entire world for their games worthy of the silver screen. Vampyr mixes real world history with traditional vampire lore and creates something fresh. Even issues of race are touched upon. I was really happy to see things like that were not shied away from. London's mysteries wait to be unraveled and you will enjoy the experience. Gameplay While doing nothing new, Vampyr employs a gameplay design befitting the action RPG genre. You cannot run into combat Rambo-style and expect to survive. strategizing before and during combat will yield the best results. I would have like a bit more stealth as you are a creature of the shadows. The gameplay does employ a fair amount of talking; do not mistake this as a pure action title. The talking goes a long way for player immersion as you will truly feel the lives you may be taking. Graphics & Sound The graphics are one of the few cavities in the teeth of Vampyr. Fight animation is smooth, level and character design are great, but some areas just look dated. The in-game visuals also do not live up to those of cutscenes, giving a very PS3/360 feel. PC will obviously look better, but you will still be able to see flaws like wobbly characters during conversation. The music and voice acting are both top notch, but loading can interfere with music. There is also the sticking point that NPCs may repeat dialogue and make no sense. For example, Nurse Crane repeats the same dialogue outside your office as when she first welcomes you to Pembroke. Thankfully, that is about as much as I can report in terms of bugs or glitches. Bottom Line: If you game on PC, PS4 or Xbox One, Vampyr should be in your collection.",4,5,5,346,1548,32,505,23,8,68.09,7.5,8.54,9.72
"Things I like: The combat is fun, and special powers were impressive. Enemy variety is kinda standard, but has enough variety to not be completely boring. The whole investigation side of things where you figure out stuff about people and the city is a neat idea, and pretty well implemented. Characters are very well developed, and generally interesting to get to know. Taken all together, the game play is good and the setting feels alive. The idea of wanting to save everyone, but needing to kill people in order to be strong enough to save them in the first place, is well implemented. Things I don't like: Animations during conversations are stiff, and all the dialogue and voice acting feels like it's pulled straight out of a soap opera. It's... not great. It's especially jarring when conversations are such a major part of the game, and you have to suffer through them because everything around them is honestly really cool. Oh, and the romance arc feels force and rushed, but that's par for the course when it comes to video games anyways. This game satisfied my RPG fix til Dragon Quest XI came out. If they had more time to develop the graphics or more of a budget, DONTNOD would've rivaled or topped the later entries of the Castlevania PS3 series in my opinion. The story and setting was certainly on point.",3,0,1,238,1053,34,358,14,8,62.32,8.79,8.47,12.51
"The closest we'll get to a Vampire the Masquerade in this day and age. It's a an action RPG with an intricate dialogue system and a city health system tied down to the health of its citizens. You can only kill characters by having a higher LV, hypnotizing them and sucking their blood. The more info you know about each citizen the more XP you are rewarded if you kill them. On the other hand you can fight and do quest and get XP that way. This is an excelent example of a AA game that is only held back by some weirs choices. Like the fact that you character can't jump or traverse the xity through the rooftops, instead you have to press a button and the right time on the right spot in order to jump up a balcony or any other platform. All in all the game is great and should be supported. They tried something new and succeeded for the most part. Get it. Cheers.",4,0,1,172,683,15,228,11,6,78.82,6.15,5.66,9.74
"I had such high hopes for this game because there hasn't been a good fantasy/non shooter game out for PS4 since Witcher 3, and I was so let down by Vampyr.

"Starlink is a pretty decent late entry in the 'toys to life' video game genre, because 1) the toys are actually really cool, 2) there isn't an overwhelming number of them to collect, and 3) you actually have the choice to collect all of the ships, weapons, and pilots digitally, if toys aren't your thing. The game itself feels a bit tedious and grindy at first, since you spend a lot of time repeating similar missions and tasks on every planet you visit. But as you begin to reap the rewards of completing these quests and maximizing your alliances, things start to get more satisfying. Difficult battles become easier and your ships, weapons, and pilots become more powerful. I completed the game in about 50 hours and ended up really enjoying it, even if the characters aren't very well developed, the story feels kind of rushed, and there's still a fair amount of world-building to be done. The Nintendo Switch version is probably the definitive one to get because of its pretty excellent Star Fox content, but I also bought the Xbox version while it was on sale because I really wanted the physical Zenith ship and Shredder weapon to round out my toy collection. For the achievements, I suspect this is a game I won't mind replaying!",4,1,0,224,989,29,336,7,16,47.46,14.59,9.24,17.98
"Starlink: Battle for Atlas is a fun, family game for tweens, teens, and adults. Flying your ship through space and battling aliens is always a fun adventure. The Starter Pack has everything you need to have fun. Using the enclosed controller mount, the ship mounts to your Xbox One controller and you are off on your adventure. The pilot, ships, weapons, and the ship's wings can be switched out with additional items available for purchase. The physical product is fun for kids to watch their ship fly and the engine even lights up too. It is easy to see why my boys love this game.",5,1,0,106,463,9,147,7,7,74.14,6.68,7.93,9.45
"We are loving Starlink: Battle for Atlas on our XBox One. It's a great sci-fi space battle action adventure game is an open-world space saga thatfeatures modular toy technology, allowing the user to customize different real-world physical starships spaceships, pilots, weapons, wings to theirgame controller. We initially played building outposts, destroyed extractors, destroyed primes, destruction was our game. It was fun, but we learned not as fun as when you play as the game is intended. What I mean is when the three dreadnoughts appear in space, the fun begins. We played until we could leave each of the planets overrun with the Legion. We encountered more enemies, mastered some weapons, ships, and pilots and learned how the combos work. Plus, fighting the Infernal Primes is an epic battle of fun. We also learned about cloning and fusing mods, leading us to have all Legendary mods. It has been a lesson in playing through, paying attention and enjoying the storyline. This game is fun and unique. It offers several difficulty choices so whether you're a new gamer or seasoned gamer, it offers something for everyone. My son seems to love scanning new lifeforms and taking down the enemy and their bases. The entire game takes place completely from the ship you choose. My son does say that it's a pain to use the digital weapons because to do so you have to move the joycons from the toy ship's cradle. So you either play all digital or all toys. He'd like the game to integrate to be able to mix and match between the two. There are some surprises, like the back of the Arwing ship lights up while the game is running. It makes for a great addition to the game. It's a huge world in the game, so there is plenty to explore and do. Overall, we are enjoying this game and find the universe to have plenty to explore, with epic battles and great details that make this game an ongoing adventure.",4,1,0,344,1522,41,503,21,8,66.51,8.05,8.41,11.32
"This is a truly unique gaming experience and unlike anything Ive ever played before. You start by picking an actual toy ship, a pilot, and weapon combo. You then place this attachment onto your video game controller and watch your creation come to life. The ship is very light and does not interfere with actual game play. The video game itself is really fun to play and has a huge expanded universe so theres a lot to explore and discover. During battle, the game will actually recommend which weapons (kinetic, fire, or ice-based) to use against certain enemies and you can just pull one weapon from the wing of the ship and replace it with another. As you do this the game automatically pauses and takes you to a home screen where you can see your customization come to life. The starter pack comes with one ship, one pilot, and three weapons (cannons that attach to end of the ships wings). I would definitely recommend this game to anyone over the age of 10. The graphics are incredible, the game play is really smooth, the story line is entertaining, and this new concept of connecting an actual toy ship to the controller just blew me away. But aside from a unique new concept, this is one of my favorite video games I played this year.",5,1,0,226,992,33,339,11,10,59.08,10.12,8.57,14.06

"Wreckfest is the spiritual successor to the original Flatout games created by Bugbear (Flatout 1, Flatout 2, Flatout: Ultimate Carnage). Flatout 3, not created by Bugbear, was panned across the board since it was a bad game. Flatout 4 while not created by Bugbear, is still a pretty good game, and a big step up from Flatout 3. That said, it still wasn't close to the original Flatout games created by Bugbear. Enter Wreckfest, the true sequel to Bugbear's classic Flatout games in everything but name. If you enjoy destruction, top notch physics, and just an overall enjoyable arcade racing game, look no further than Wreckfest. It's not perfect & has a few issues such as the A.I. sometimes being cheap & the loading times being long, however they did recently release a patch to improve both.

"So I've had Wreckfest purchased on Steam for years now, but haven't been able to upgrade my PC enough to play it, so I bought it again on console and am having a blast. There's no mod support yet, but hopefully console will get it. There's a couple dozen cars as of right now, plus like 6 or so silly cars, damage models are pretty realistic with the minor bangs and crashes, but once you start slamming the cars for awhile, they turned into foil balls basically. AI are pretty aggressive, which makes it fun, and challenging at the same time. What little I've played online seems to be good as well, everyone I was with had a max of 80 ping and nothing really lagged or ruined the experience for everyone else. It's not as silly or crazy as Flatout, but it's made by the same guys and published by THQNordic, so... Praise both of those companies. If you like racing and being a little aggressive/beating doors in, this is the game for you.",5,1,0,183,735,11,250,8,9,68.04,9.45,6.52,11.55

"This game is little different from the others that preceeded it. Adequate graphics, sometimes annoying controls, limited gameplay, just sub-par in every respect when reviewed as a $59 game. Fortunately I am a game club member, so got a good chunk of the price taken off, and used reward zone points to lessen the cost even more. If my son wasn't such a huge Pixar Cars fan, I never would spend this much money for such a mediocre kids game. This game may earn 4 stars had it cost $25 or under, but not at sixty bucks. Graphics are alright but hardly worth bragging about, but it seems that the controls are even worse than they were in the first Cars game. The races have a little variety, and the free play area is a nice change of pace. I do miss the challenge of finding all the postcards and such from the first game though, things you could do as a single player in more of a campaign mode style setting. There are no such things here other than tricks, which is where it really just loses the replay value.

"Big step up from last years game. Single player is great. Nice to have every car at your disposable from the beginning you just have to find them. Police chases put you in that speed feeling that the last few games got away from. The crashes become somewhat like they tried to copy burnout but they still fit. If your a fan of any of the older nfs games this definitely is a step back to its roots. For people that want to review by just saying bad but have no substance then compare it to old games ignore.

This is a arcade racer with 90% of its cars available from the start as long as you find them. The others are 'Most Wanted ' cars you unlock by beating them. The other challenges in the game are more for people who just like to mess around & have fun, or people that like to complete 100% of a game.

If it weren't for this disappointing 'feature', the review would be perfect as this game is potentially the result of combing the best of Need For Speed combined with the best of Burnout. Beautiful graphics, wonderful car control and sense of speed. It just feels incomplete when I'm being enticed to buy something while playing the game. But who knows?

"Yeah I used Burnout twice. It's good and bad at the same time. Taking out the competition is fun and getting their boost is cool. However crashing into a non-movable trashcan not fun. The original Most Wanted was a more pleasant experience. The speed and intensity wasn't always there but I liked that. It gave you a chance to go back and relax or build up your cash reserve. This game stressed too much Burnout style racing, minimalistic cops (a regular mainstay in Need for speed) and lack of story. Sorry the last Most Wanted and Undercover had decent (not great) storylines. Is it a good racer-yes. Good buy for 20-30- yes. Good time filler yes. But I hope the next Need for Speed goes back to the roots of the game. I've been playing since the first Hot Pursuit on the playstation. Those are the racing games I enjoy.

"This is by far the worst Need for Speed game produced to date. The past few NFS games have been met with mixed reviews but I still found them to be enjoyable. This one on the other hand is just dreadful. There is no storyline, which I admit isn't a huge deal to most racing games but NFS usually has some interesting story. The control of the cars is very difficult to learn...half the time it seems like it wants to be a racing sim, the other half it think its an arcade game. The streering is bad, the braking is bad. And if you just tap another vehicle or wall you crash and your race gets interupted by this annoying 'crash' sequence. if you want a fun arcade NFS racing game this holiday season go pick up the original Most Wanted game that was released when Xbox 360 was first released. Even though it's many years old, it's way better than this game. The makers of Need for Speed should be ashamed of putting their name on this. An even better suggestion would be to go buy Forza Horizon. It's a lot more fun and enjoyable arcade racer.",1,15,27,204,820,14,269,13,6,79.35,6.09,5.95,9.02

I begged her to just look online at either Target or Kmart to see that it was indeed the limited edition version. I told her that if she would not even look at this I would be forced to send the Best Buy copy back... she replied ok... go ahead. I jumped in my car after hanging up the phone and drove to Target and PURCHASED the Need for Speed 'Most Wanted' Limited edition for 39.99 plus tax.

I put a good 10hrs into the game (Just playing it solo) That way i can actually take my time and take everything in and explore the landscape Story: Is pure love letter to Grindhouse Films/Lucio Fulci (It feels like you are thrown into Fulci's Zombie aka Zombie Flesh Eaters (1979) While the entire Zombie subgenre in pop cultured has decayed and become a parody of itself (Don't avoid this because of the oversaturation of all things zombie) Achievements are Quotes from various 70's & 80's Horrors films, massive Easter eggs throughout the landscape It would be awesome if Rebellion could acquirer the rights to Fulci's Zombie and make some type of tie-in adaption to Zombie Controls: are solid (If you are new to Rebellion Studios) It may take a good 20min to get used to but, once you do everything will become second nature I honestly feel the controls to ZA4 is close to perfect Audio: Best if you can take advantage of the DTS 5.1 option (The score is flawless it sounds like a homage to everything Italian Horror/Goblin There's also a sample used That i could bank is from The Warriors (I would love to get a Original Soundtrack for this game) It adds a lot to the game all the sound effects, weapons, splatter sounds, V/O actors are super high quality Graphics: Are really good Rebellion Studios is a legit HQ Studio (They really get overlooked as a Studio) that puts out Triple A content Fun factor: Super fun and enjoyable (There is grinding but, it's actually fair and adds a lot of layers to the overall enjoyment Once you rank up past 10 it opens up the new adds-on elemets to change things up Best way to Rank-up play through the Horde mode for at least 90min. then move on to the Story Campaign",5,1,0,359,1518,36,517,4,44,-6.09,36.41,8.73,39.91
"BEFORE YOU BUY, it's worth noting that the information on this page at the time of this review is incorrect: This is a port of the game Deemo, not Deemo: Last Recital. The former is the original version of the game while the latter is a significantly remastered version that adds additional play modes, extends the story, and adds a new after-story. A port of the original has been available for digital purchase on the Switch since 2017, while Last Recital is apparently still exclusive to the PS Vita. This is just a physical release of the Switch port of the original game. I was pretty disappointed when I booted this up only to find myself face to face with the same game I had already purchased digitally over a year ago, when I was expecting the remastered version. All this aside though, the original Deemo is still great with a surprisingly good story for a rhythm game, and fun gameplay that's easy to pick up on even for non-gamers. If you know how a piano works, you'll be able to figure this out pretty easily (although that doesn't necessarily mean the songs themselves will be a walk in the park). The Switch port comes with all the extra DLC songs that were offered in the original mobile version of the game built-in for free, and there are a ton of them. This is definitely not a game you'll be able to complete in just a few sittings if you're planning to play through everything. Overall this game is definitely worth its price even if you're not used to the rhythm genre. Just make sure you know that you're buying a port of the original version and not Last Recital.",4,4,0,301,1263,33,439,11,13,55.67,12.29,7.79,15.33

"Evolution is a must have game for those who do and even those who do not typically gravitate towards park builder games. The overall appeal (graphically) for evolution is astonishing, especially if you have a solid 4k TV and are playing on the One X (I have a Pro as well so I am sure for PlayStation only users the game would be almost equally as good). The details from top to bottom in this game have far exceeded my expectations, and with only about 6 hours into the game there is so much more to explore with only about 7 of the 40 something dinosaurs unlocked and a slew of buildings to still discover, along with the other islands. Gameplay wise the interface, controls, camera, and building components are easily accessible making the functionality for a sim building game in my opinion moderately easy. With a couple hours of getting use to everything any individual 10 + years of age could find great fun and success with this game. Some users have reported problems (bugs/glitches) with this game and I so far have only ran into one instance where the game kicked me out and restarted. However, after almost every action completed, the game will autosave so when this occurred I did not lose any progress. Frontier seems to be very driven in continuously updating and patching this game, as well as working with the community to ensure that a solid gaming experience for years to come can and will be achieved. Before going I do not want to mislead anyone with my rating and just say that althoguh I gave Evolution five stars, my true score for this game is 4.6/5 making it a game well worth exploring.",5,9,5,292,1295,39,449,10,15,47.11,13.94,9.26,17.02
"This game is akin to a roller coaster 'tycoon' or Sim City, but with dinosaurs and your own dinosaur research facility. I purchased the game for my 11 year old daughter, who loves dinosaurs and everything Jurassic Park/World. The game proved to be a little too sophisticated for her. If you like 'tycoon'-like games and dinosaurs/Jurassic Park, then I suspect this game would be for you! If you are looking for something with a little more action, or more simplistic gameplay, this is probably not the best game for you.",4,2,0,93,414,12,135,5,9,65.15,8.79,8.78,12.6

There are 3 track you can focus on as you play. Choose scientist, business manager or grow the park through public relations and tourist growth. Regardless of which of the 3 youselect, you are still going to use the skills of the other 2 to grow your park. Yeah, its that sort of sandbox game like Sim City, where you balance factors and deal with disasters to expand your park. But tons of people like the Sim City sort of games.

Music is also wonderful and effectively recreates the Jurassic park atmosphere. Lots of things tinker with. Cons: Bad AI. People and dinos looks good at first, but dont stare too long.

"GBVS is a fun fighting game, but sadly it feels like a cashgrab behind the polish. Only 11 characters at launch is pretty disappointing, even moreso when they had two season passes planned before launch. The gameplay itself is good, but the value is honestly pretty bad unless you're a huge fan of Granblue or if you're a fiend and will play a ton of versus matches to get your money's worth.

There's a great cast of characters, lots of varied fighting styles, & a fantastic soundtrack. Highly recommended if you enjoy fighting games.

I remember fighting in the USA and throwing someone into the boxes.. What happened to that!! Also, there is no bonus round. What happened to smashing up the Mercedes Benz.. I loved That!!! I would only recommend this if you enjoy the classic game with out all the fun extras in a more colorful scene..",4,1,0,117,468,8,157,9,4,80.12,5.31,5.44,7.94
"Street Fighter has returned from the land of the dead and thank god, and if you don't believe in god then thank your savior, and if you don't have a savior... well thank capcom. For those who know Street Fighter is the best fighting game ever, and thankfully the fourth installment is no different. You can play as 20 some characters each with distinctly different styles of playing. The graphics in the game are top notch. Tthe painted art style really grasps you and pulls you into the action. The animation is smooth and running at a great 60 frames it is amazing. Every animation of every move is beautiful and graceful. The genre-defining 2-D gameplay returns brilliantly. The detail in each of the stages is great too, there is constantly something happening in the backround of the stage. The audio is typicall of most games at this point. It runs in Dolby Digital 5.1 and maybe DTS, I am not sure. The sound of flesh hitting flesh is very satisfying when pulling off an ultra combo against a tough foe. The Singleplayer is a solid experience. You fight round after round against characters selected at random. The final Boss, Seth, is a complete maniac with a cheap set of moves that you can counter after learning his timing. You will learn his timing though because the campign is so repetetive you will be able to blaze through Seth time after time. The campaign has several difficulties that you can set depending on whether you are a rookie or a seasoned veteran. The multiplayer mode is great, with both local and online multiplayer modes it will keep you coming back for more. Each of the characters have unique playing style with different combos. The unlockables will keep you playing the campaign to achieve them all. The game will keep you playing for roughly 100 hours before you get tired of it. I am going to tell you right now that it is most fun to play local multiplayer with family and friends. The game is easily worth 60 bucks. Out of 10 I would give Street Fighter IV an 8.9 out of 10. The game is amazing but not exceptionaly amazing. Please leave feedback. Thanks for reading, BEYOND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,1,0,384,1693,42,548,30,6,73.11,6.24,7.81,9.5

All you have to do is meet certain requirements like.. certain amount of perfects, some ultra finishes, etc, BUT ITS NOT HARD. Like i said SF does it again, this is what fighting games are all about. Ive been a SF fan since i was 6 and ive always loved it. This SF 4 is beautiful, the graphics are awesome, the controllers are perfect, the new characters are cool and the new specials are the bomb, theyre crazy!! If youre a SF fan, you wont have a problem learning the moves. The only thing i dont like about the game is when people keep using Ken all the time and all they do is corner others and do shoryukens like crazy, other than that this game is a must have for all the SF fans out there, this game was the only reason why i got a ps3.",5,1,0,172,675,7,224,9,7,77.26,7.23,5.73,9.27

They basically said, OK well have a diesel manikin guy with a circle on his stomach. lame! All his moves are cheesier than cheese. the insane Teleporting, the fact that he can keep grabbing you no matter what. using other peoples attacks. I despise Seth even his name is not exactly a bad guys name. They messed it up with this guy. However buy this game Is the best.

I love fighting games but this game is so much fun and I grew up playing every street fighter on all the systems that came out before the once we have now and when I saw this game on tv I checked it out bought it and you can't say anything about the graphics, if you have a cheap TV, you need an HD TV period. I have mine hooked up to my 40 inch and the graphics and sound are truly amazing and I love it there's not a bad thing about it and some people are just bad at video games period and say its hard. That's so not the case if your into good fighting games you will love the graphics truly the best fighting games and the Combos some are hard but if you practice you will be pretty darn good and if you don't practice of course your going to suck. By far one of the best games I have had and I have had it since it game out and I just can't believe the bad reviews about this amazing game! Dont buy this game if you have a cheap tv because you cant see the game how it was meant to be but if you have an 'HD TV' and its hooked up to the HDMI it will look truly amazing and the sound just every thing is crisp about it, don't hate on this game, it's one of the best.",5,0,1,265,943,7,312,6,18,62.4,15.53,4.45,18.72

"I am a long time Street Fighter fan and I had been waiting for this since Comic-Con 2008 Street Fighter panel. This game is well worth the wait! The graphics are amazing, both character and background with fluid animations and perfectly rendered character designs. While some games may try for a realistic look, SF IV retians the classic Street Fighter look and feel. The characters look and play like the fighters fans have known for years. The gameplay is fast and intense! There is no shortage of action in this game and the controls work great. I am using the Dualshock 3 controller and have found control to be flawless. The gameplay itself harkens back to SF II, but with some new twists to bring Street Fighter to the new generation. The combo system works intuitively and there are different types of moves to keep you playing for a long time to come. The gameplay is easy enough to pick-up for beginning gamers and has enough depth to interest more experienced gamers. The difficulty is adjustable from Easiest to Hardest, which is great for any level of gamer. I've unlocked most of the hidden characters, including Akuma, and have had no problems doing so. The anime scenes for each character are fun to watch, and makes me wish the people who created these scenes would make a Street Fighter IV anime. The Japanese voice track features some top ranked voice talent, so I recommend the Original Japanese dialogue over the English dub. Lots of action, great graphics and high replay value. Street Fighter IV rocks!",5,0,1,268,1231,32,394,17,9,66.46,7.91,9.33,11.08
"Overall I like this game. It's a solid SF game. The online battle is great and fun you can mix it up with people all over the world instead of having to wait for a friend to come over. The graphics are great, but the story lines are pretty stupid. I don't think they invested a great deal of time in the story line. My biggest complaint with this game is the last boss as most people have said. He is way to hard even on the very easy setting. It makes it difficult to unlock the hidden characters. You can spend an hour easily trying to beat him. I'm also not a fan of the controls for this game with the PS3 controller. The D-Pad is not in a great spot, it makes it kind of awkard and the analog stick doesn't provide enough friction to get the special moves right everytime.

"If you like exploration, don't mind the brutal souls nature of combat, this is the Jedi game you have been looking for. I've enjoyed the time I've spent, there is a lot more exploration then I expected and I'm having fun with it. The combat is more on the souls side, with a risk/reward save/death mechanic. Also this game does not hold your hand. There is no waypoint marker, and the HUD is limited. Though Respawn did a good job giving clues, like having the droid on your back turn red when you need to heal, so that is a nice change in pace, unlike a lot of newer games that will guide you from point A-B on the screen. Only design choice they made that might be immersion breaking is the fact you don't slice the Stromtroopers in half. I get they most likely wanted to keep the rating at T so they couldn't, but I can see how that could bother someone, so giving the warning here.

"Finally, a fun Star Wars adventure. It has the look and feel of the movies, and using the light saber just feels perfect. The story is entertaining, and if your PC has the horsepower to play it at epic, it looks incredible. Another nice aspect is the ability to select difficulty, because it can very hard on Jedi Master.

"This is my starting point in the call of duty series and it is an excellent one at that, I do plan on going back to play the predecesor call of duty 4 but for now let me talk Modern Warfare 2. This game has a stellar campaign with plenty of omg moments packed into the relatively short story missions clocking in around 6 or so hours and incredible visuals to compliment those moments. Theres also the inclusion of spec ops mode which are pretty much campaign missions without the story to accompany them, these can be done with a friend and will take some impressive players to unlock all the stars for the missions. The sound effects from bullets whizzing overhead to large explosions in the distance are all spot on and make the experience all that more enjoyable. The multiplayer is what wil keep me coming back to this game however as it has a vast amount of unlockable weapons, emblems, and prestiges. The ability to customize my player online to have either a sniper, smg, or assault rifle is an amazing feat ( if a little unbalanced) and keeps me playing deep into a saturday night to try and earn new attachments to my guns as well as new perks. although the experience can be frustrating at times depending on what type of people your playing with its really great at its good times. As a new player to this series Im enjoying every bit of it.",5,19,2,249,1088,27,363,8,15,51.91,13.75,8.94,16.79

"Modern warfare2 for xbox 360 is by far the best multiplayer game for xbox 360 the campaign is great spec-ops is fun the only down side about modernwarfare 2 is that it is easy for modders to get in and cheat but when u end up beating them that makes you feel even better also i believe this game is better then black ops because the guns are better and the graphics i dont like having to buy everything in black ops plus the weapons are insufficent they had some great ideas but when it comes to multiplayer in call of duty infinity ward knows how to make a good game the only good things about treyarch is there campaign and zombies which i like alot.",5,13,0,127,525,8,170,1,62,-35.31,49.74,8.27,53.32

"Let me say first have always had a love for FPS and this genre of game. This one blows them all out of the water. I've owned all of the Call of Duty games but never found myself still playing almost a year later. The only games that have kept my attention span this long were GRAW 1, GRAW 2, and Halo 3. Multiplayer modes that it. Graphics in this game are amazing. Environments are great, not standard textures such as with most Halo games. Campaign was fun and challenging at times. The reason to buy this game is for XBox Live Multiplayer. This is extremely addicting. You will find yourself on it for hours try to unlock the next weapon, attachment, callsign, emblem, or dominate your friends. Never has a multiplayer for console brought so many people together of all ages. The only downside to the online play is the Modders, Hackers, etc. All of these people are spineless losers who have no integrity. What is funny is that they're playing an Military games. One of the core values that was pushed on me during my service to the country was integrity.",5,13,2,195,840,18,275,16,5,75.16,5.8,7.1,8.57

"I've played every single Cod across every platform since the days of the 1st Cod on PC and Call of duty modern warfare 2 is as near to perfect as an Xbox game can get. The graphics in this game are stellar, the 1st modern warfare is the only other game for 360 that even comes anywhere near the graphic quality of this game which would only make sense because MW1 was made by the same company but modern warfare 2 received a bit of an updated look including a touch more color. The default control layout is the most functional set up i have ever utilized in any game. The story mode is of adequate length mission-wise and varies in time length depending on the difficulty settings and has a wonderfully baffling ending. The absolute most attractive feature of this game is by far the multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is the fastest, most intense multiplayer experience on Xbox live. Every portion of the multiplayer mode is customizable from weapons, to perks, to equipment and every combination there of. If you own a 360 you absolutely must get this game and if you don't have a 360, GO GET ONE!",5,10,2,204,888,22,298,8,12,57.37,11.59,8.63,14.51
"OK, OK, OK, everyone that came from under their rock early 2009 couldn't wait to get MW2, and instantly rushed to pick it up at their local Best Buy, go back under their rock, and play it. Yes, I get it. You were VERY excited, and wanted something that was more amazing than the prequel. But did you get that? Well......if ya ask me...NO, you didnt'!!!! 'ZOMG! He said it's a bad game! FLAME HIM!!' Yea, slow down for a bit. Use some intellect when you read this, k? Well......I'll be nice. The good thing about this game, minus the nice weapon sounds and the actually enjoyable SpecOps, is the 'OMG!!' moments in the campaign. MW had the sniper level, and walking around before dying thanks to a nuke going off. But what's in MW2? Well, how about a snowmobile level, ice climbing (don't look down), killing innocent Russian people in the THIRD LEVEL (yep...No Russian..YouTube it), sneaking around bases with surpressed weapons, and throwing a knife at the end of the game. Yes....OMG moments, and LOTS of them. What's the bad, though? Well....the campaign is short....VERY short.....UNBELIEVABLY short. Four hours??? ON NORMAL?!!!! WHAAAT?!!! MW1 took at least 8 on Normal! And the sequel is shorter?!!! Yea, no...not likin' that. Also, could they make it any harder to follow the story? Bouncing from Ramirez to Roach to Ramirez to MacTavish (yes, he's in the game).......I lost track of what was actually going on after 'No Russian'....third level...that's the last time I remember the story being clarified EVER in this game.....and with a four-hour campaign....should I be surprised? I also said the online wasn't so great.....well...if you played the game BEFORE the many, many patches, you already know why. Maybe it's because I REALLY liked MW1 due to it actually took SKILL to dominate in that game, but...wow...why, Infinity Ward? Why????? Why would you let people run around with a grenade launcher, Thumper (which launches explosive rounds....just like another weapon...hmmm), and Scavenger so I can keep picking up launcher rounds? This game wasn't meant for veteran players of MW1 like myself. It was meant for novice players to hop in and get easy kills without using much brain power. Also, some of the killstreaks are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered. Think about it......Chopper Gunner comes in....flies above you...you die. You spawn, you die again. Yea, let's change 'Hit X to respawn' to 'Hit X to die and get your butt spawn camped by a Chopper Gunner', which fires a flare before it can be shot down. So, if you're lucky enough to have a horrible gunner that just can't see you, or you have Cold-Blooded (prevents you from showing up as a red square), you can shoot two Stingers at it and take it down. Ehh......it can happen. But let's talk about that AC130. Get 11 kills in a row, and you get to call in this baby (if you pick it as a killstreak). So, what happens with this thing? Oh...nothing......except it rains (they won't let me type it) on Earth with explosive shells firing at you, and shooting four flares before FINALLY being shot down....unless you have a team that's willing to co-ordinate attacks (one person fires a Stinger, flare...another fires, AC130 can't shoot flares in time...BOOM!)....just run....and hide.....for a good minute. Don't even get me started on the glitchers before the patches. I played a few hours on Saturday.....nine games. Of those nine, half had people doing the care package glitch, and the rest were modded rooms where you basically run at twice the speed....yea, that's a fun way to play a game! Let's glitch and cheat like we're playing Halo 2 back in its prime days!! :D Good idea (.....insert explicit word here). Before that, it was rooms that had infinite ammo....yea, imagine an automatic grenade launcher...with infinite ammo...FOR EVERYONE.....fun? Yes. Annoying after a while? Yes. Yet ANOTHER problem with online....LAAAAAAAAG. No, it's not my connection. 6MB wouldn't lag so much. But I can't count how many times I fired four rounds into someone that tried to knife me, only having the last two register, letting that guy knife me. OR, shooting an automatic gun...one, two, three, four, five, six....guess which ones registered? Yep, four, five and six....the last rounds register....what happened to the first three?!! Don't you people know you can't destroy matter?!!! If you're like me, you'll get beyond annoyed with people running around stabbing you, or sniping you with a shotgun....actually, lemme talk about that as well. How far do you think you should be able to hit someone with a shotgun? Not that far, right? Don't you think that.....hmm, a few feet....is effective, but after that, it's not worth anything? Yea, tell that to the SPAS-12, or the Model 1887 before it got patched. I'm on the catwalk on Sub Base...that's two full levels up...I kill a guy in two shots that's below me.......yep...the range with shotties is unbelievable. And another pet-peeve. How is a .50cal sniper rifle going to actually HIT a guy, and he doesn't die?! Come on!!! It's a 50....50!!!!!! That's death waiting to happen! But chest? Walks. Neck? Ehh, if he's lucky, walks....but the Intervention, magically, they're not so lucky....uh-huh. Great job, guys. Maybe I'm being WAAAAY too picky, but coming from a game that actually was close to being a well-balanced game (MW1) to one that's completely broken (the FUBAR mistake they called MW2), it's obvious to see that MW2 was nothing but a cash cow, only to abuse the name instead of actually improving from MW1. It was made to be for those novice players/little kids that want the best early and go 'OMG! Grenade Launcher! And I can still have perks! Cool!' and go use that instead of learning how to aim a gun, fire rounds (assuming all of them register!), and getting a kill. *sigh*.....veterans......don't buy this game, 'less you're more patient than I am......and I'm not a patient person to begin with........ P.S. I re-read this five times to delete the profanity from the review....that's how frustrating this game is.....six, now.",3,9,1,1129,4497,68,1506,148,2,86.24,3.13,3.74,5.46
"Best game of the series. The campaign was great. Spec ops was a big +. Multiplayer was amazing, the maps were good and guns as well, more customization.

Killstereaks are basically a killing spree. So you if you got 3 kills in a row with out dying you get UAV... to spot enemies on your HUD. You can customize your killstreaks also. Now the campaign.. its fun, but it get boring at some times. But I don't really care about the campaign. Get it.. it has the best multiplayer ever.

"I would say the online experience is the best for this game, but if you are not hooked up to Xbox Live and still want a good game Call of Duty has it. Special Ops is never ending it seems and adds a lot of difficulty to the game. The campaign was fun and the different difficulties actually make it really hard. I would buy this game if you own a console.",5,6,1,72,279,7,97,4,6,74.59,7.33,5.34,11.09
"I was very excited about getting this game as I heard MW3 was practically a repeat of this game (however I may purchase MW3 in the near future). The gameplay is nearly flawless, you move smoothly, and it's a great overall experience when you're playing. My favorite part of the game is definetly the 'Special Ops' mode. If you can't afford Xbox Live for the online multiplayer #which is pefect, the way you level up, the killstreaks, the customs you can create is very innovative and very fun# then this mode is what you'll find mostly exciting. There are a variety of missions to play and each one is challenging and extremely fun to play. You can either go solo or play with a friend. I recommend a second player because by doing that, you'll get the most out of the 'Special Ops.' The biggest flaw of this game is the single player Campaign. First off, there is no co-op like in World at War, so you're stuck playing by yourself even if you want to play with a friend. The story however, is extremely confusing and hard to keep up with. It is almost as if it doesn't make sense. The layout of the storyline is very random and you shift from one person to another trying to figure out what relation the last mission has to the current one. It's very short compared to other Call of Duty games as I was able to tackle it in mere hours. The Campaign was obviously not the focus on this project. Overall it is a great game but the story needs big adjustments.",4,5,1,282,1145,25,394,15,8,69.55,8.23,6.5,11.07

"When i bought this game in November of 2009, I thought hey, Call of Duty, all right woohooo.. I purchased the game as soon as I could like any other anxious customer. As soon as I put the game in my Xbox, I fell addicted to it.. It was very fun... Until i prestiged.. Everything got boring... People were cheating.. The killsreaks were insanly overpowered.. You respawned in a location were the enemy is! Really 'Team Deathmatch' Is not team deathmatch, its run around the map shooting everyone else, by camping in buildings, setting up claymores, and so forth.. Now for a new game, that people haven't really thought of at all. That is Battlefield Bad Company 2... A game most people say, 'what is that??' Let me tell you this game, is 10 times more real, than MW2. This game requires straegy... You can't run out in the middle of a map, shooting a grenade launcher, and thinking you'll kill someone.. You can't snipe or camp in buildings.. For exmple.. You know how you can shoot a rocket launcher at a house in MW2 and nothing will happen to the building? Well in bad company, you can blow the **** out of walls, tell your buddies were the enemy is if you spot them, you can drive vehicles in Bad company.. (Tanks, ATV, humvees, choppers) You can heal your soldiers, no more getting shot and immediatly dying.. (MW2) And most of all it requires strategy.. You have to work together to win the game and get more points.. It is more fun overall, and i encourage everyone to get it, if you like MM2, but is sick of online play.. I thought the same thing.. 'I'm not bying because of a review'.. but trust me it is worth the money..",3,3,1,305,1234,27,409,27,4,81.92,4.64,5.37,8.06

"When I first started playing this game I had lots of fun but now with all the cheating and boosting going on it really makes no sense to even play anymore. People are constantly exploiting the game and Infinity ward is doing nothing to stop it. For example every other free for all match you will find someone boosting ' setting tactical insertion and killing each other over and over to gain killstreak rewards and eventually the nuke BOOM!! game over for everyone. Team death match is not really a team at all everyone is out for number one. This game has lost alot of it's original flare because of the cheating and lack of teamwork. Things that could make this game better is maybe a lobby for people who just want to cheat but I suppose they wouldn't find any fun in that. I know halo multiplayer trys to match people of the same skill but in MW2 you will be matched against someone who is either and absolute expert or someone who has never played a shooter game before,so maybe if they could match people according to their skill level. All in all this is a really fun game if you like just running and guning.Also parents beware!! you kids will be exposed to some very filthy language and sad to say it is mostly just little kids talking like this.

What annoys me about the game though is that sometimes when you shoot someone it doesnt react, so like I'd shoot someone and they wouldnt get hurt. Another thing is the boosters in the game, they got rid of Cage match because people were using that to boost so they are trying to get rid of it but lets face it, they won't ever be able to totally rid the game of cheaters and again lets face it.. everyones boosted at least once lol whether youre trying to get FMJ for your gun or trying to get Fall. Another annoying thing is when playing Hardcore.. youre not supposed to get hitmarkers but sometimes you will.

Graphics outstanding, action packed and gripping, and the diversity of different weapons was dizzying.

"I bought this game simply for the on-line play. It never gets dull! There's so many challenges to complete, guns to master, and then you have the Prestige modes. I play this game every day online. It's a lot of fun and the game play always changes as you play against different people. I bought the wireless headset for chatting, but I found I hardly use it as I'm tired of hearing 10 year old's cursing up a storm or people trash talking others. MUTE is a great feature! My only complaint about the online portion is the amount of points it takes to update your maps - but the updated maps are great. Learn your maps, and master your guns. The best gun to use is the AUG HBAR and the .50 Cal Sniper rifle. Anyway, master your guns, learn your maps and take out the 'campers'... oh, it's so much fun to ruin their killstreaks!",4,3,2,162,639,5,209,13,4,85.04,4.49,5.02,6.22
"Nice game overall but a little short in playing time in single player. I would recommend you resist getting the 'stimulus package' yet as there seem to be issues, as I found out to my cost by not reading the on line reviews before buying. The look and feel of the game is good and overall it's entertaining. The only drawback I have found so far is not with the game its self but with all the gutter mouth trash talk on multi-player. Sounds like it's full of 10 year olds who like to call everyone by the 'N' word. At least you can mute them. Do you know what is your 10 year old is doing on xbox live ? That aside, I would recommend the game.",4,1,0,130,499,7,165,8,5,82.96,5.72,4.95,8.65

"In CODMW 1 I was one of many people who played for hours with out getting tired. In this one... the story is different...

"If you're one of the few who still do not own this game I would strongly advise that you not buy this game. Unless, that is, you were not planning to play multiplayer. The campaign and spec ops are fun but only a limited amount. The multiplayer is terrible. The concept is great; however, the game becomes so inconsistent depending on the connection. If you get even slightly angry when playing any game you will find yourself very irrate amidst the glitch-plagued, cheat-filled multiplayer. The arrogant creators at infinity ward believed the game would be glitch-free, unable to be hacked. They made a terrible shortcut in the game design--lack of any administrative tools to counter glitching and cheating. Now the game has seen 4 fun-killing glitches and the latest has been abused for the past 3-4 weeks with no end in sight. Quiet simply the game is no longer any fun.",2,2,1,158,700,16,228,10,8,68.72,7.6,8.38,10.37
"I really, really wanted to love this game. I bought it, and played it for several hours. Mostly online. Its... old. I played so much COD when it first came out. I did the levels / achievements / the collectables / the guns / prestiege points / etc. Well if you haven't had enough of it... It's back. But to be honest, this really feels like a mulitplayer map upgrade for the old COD. It's not worth a full $60. Exactly the same old style of play, other than it takes less bullets now to kill someone in the game. Average life span in multiplayer is less than a few seconds. When you get your barings and run around a corner into gunfire, and then respawn, come back, get killed, respawn on a grenade, respawn... (yawn) It's boring, becuase it's been done to death. Nothing new here... Single player is very quick and easy, but it's level designs are nicely put together. No one talks over multiplayer unless it's vile cursing and racial epitets... (more yawn) I'll play Left 4 Dead 2 or Assassins Creed 2 thank you very much. Save your $$$ if you want plot and depth to your game. If YOU ABSOLUTELLY HAVE TO play a shooter game with no plot other than kill streaks and respawn timers, then have at it... this is one of the good ones for that... I just felt that I want more meat on my video game bone. This is a COD Fan boy's wet dream. For all others, avoid and go find something with a little more depth...",2,1,0,271,1065,19,355,25,3,85.01,4.1,4.58,7.14
"I have been off and on with this MW2 since its' release and I have to say that it is a very enjoyable game. The fact that I keep coming back to it speaks for itself enough considering how easily I tend to bore of a game. + First, I have to touch on what everyone is saying about the campaign. Personally I enjoyed it. The storyline was decent and most definitely an interesting concept. It wasn't the hardest campaign to finish, but it was fun none-the-less, I have a decent amount hours logged on the campaign itself. + The key highlight for me has been the multiplayer and xbox live play. I have spent a significant amount of time on live, as well as just doing some free-for-all matches with some friends of mine. I have found the weapon leveling system to be very fun! I like how you have to posses either a certain amount of skill or large amount of freetime to unlock upgrades for your weapons. I always hated the person who would run around with the best weapon and equipment on a game and obtain a decent score just because of their inventory. + Now, on the other hand, one bad thing about the live play and weapons... The akimbo shotguns... Just in case you are not familiar with this, it is a dual wielded shotgun that does very high damage and has a rediculous spread that will hit its target if you are even remotely close. It takes little to no skill with this weapon and every online game, there seems to be some no talent idiot running around blasting people with these. Last I checked, video games are quite a bit more fun when there is some sort of tactics or planning employed. + Overall, I have found this game to be great! Great graphics, awesome leveling system, fun campaign, and intense multiplayer action. I would recomment this game to any FPS lover.",5,1,0,331,1400,25,464,19,8,70.56,7.75,7.37,9.99

"Infinity Ward should not have included the scene that role plays a terrorist killing innocent civilians. It doesn't matter that there is an option to not play it. The fact that they would create a virtual reality for people to take on a role as a terrorist is immoral and shameful. Sell-outs: Obvious profiting off of shock factor with no care about the real world tragedies that could be caused by promoting such sick philosophies with virtual blood lust. In addition, playing the game is not as fun with friends because systems cannot be linked together with more than one player per system. So, the days of playing 2 teams of 4 on 4 on two TVs back to back are over.

Cod4 = pistol shot to bad guy, win game. W@W = exact same. MW2 = knife throw to bad guy, win game. Cant believe how lame they ended the last THREE games the same way. Slowmo kill saving your buddy and its over. Overall still fun. The multiplayer can burn. Its the worst of all 4 latest games following the CoD4 pattern. The killstreaks are sooo stupid. Player controlled missles that show where your at? Player controlled death ships that shot missles at displayed targets. You can get like 10-15 kills with these things!!!! On CoD4 and W@W you had 3 kill streaks and you might get a few kills for them but this game went waaaaaay over the top. They changed the perks too much. The pro perks were cool but the effects they gave were rediculous. They turned this CoD game into a Halo copy. Think about it for a second. ZERO fall damage with commando pro. Long distance lunge attacks with a knife? Unlimited sprinting ability?!?! I thought this was modern warfare? Not super human combat. The one thing that makes me sooo mad is the marathon/lightweight/commando tactical knife combo that most players use onilne. Makes it completely annoying to play getting knifed because the character runs sooo fast you cant shoot him in time before he turns to mist 20ft away and reappears with a knife inside of you. Stupid.

It seems IW intended to allow all of the bad and inexperienced players to do what they do best, annoy everybody else. Some killstreaks are ridiculous and make the other person invincible.

The game hasn't changed for oh what this will be the 6th installment and they still sell a ton of this game!!! No one will buy this game because they seek some new radical style of game play, they buy it because its COD just like all the other COD's out there and the game is amazing and why fix something that isnt broke!!! We want new we play left for dead! We want an amazing online FPS we play COD!",5,0,1,103,388,4,123,6,5,88.38,5.2,4.63,8.42

I had been hoping ever since COD4 came out that they would make a new MODERN WARFARE because COD4 jus lacked a lot of the new weapons that were being used when the game was made and COD4 didnt have all the thing and military devices that are offered in MODERN WARFARE 2.

"This is one of the most fun games to play. First of all, the campaign is pretty cool. There are great action parts and great cinematic cut scenes all tied together to continue the story from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The only bad thing is that it is a little short. Then special-ops co-op mode is pretty fun. It is basically doing a mission with a buddy. The great thing for both modes are the achievements; they make you want to do the hard levels. Then of course, there is the online multiplayer. This by far is the best part. There are so many guns and attachments to unlock. Also, the class perks makes online play much more fair and fun than CoD4. There are also many killstreak rewards to choose from: care packages to nukes!

Multiplayer is vastly improved from Modern Warfare and World at War. Few new features, load-outs are more customizable then before, more challenges, Killstreak reward system is FANTASTIC and they added new game modes.

"Being new to this game and the XBox 360, I was fairly unsure about what this game had to offer. But, now that I own it, I love it. My three favorite things about this game are as follows: online, online, and online. Of all the internet gaming i've done, this is by far my most enjoyable experience. As soon as you buy this game, please make sure you've got your XBox Gold Membership up and running, or else you'll miss out. As for the gameplay, its laid out perfectly and you have a ton of different weapons at your fingertips. The scenery is awesome, and it changes constantly. So, don't worry about getting bored. As I stated above, the campaign is kinda short, but thats a small price to pay for the entire package. As for controls, the controller set-up is pretty easy to figure out, and eventually will become instinctive for you. I own a Wii and was VERY used to the motion and point controller, but I still got used to the 360's controller set-up for this game pretty quick. So, seasoned 360 owners should have no issues. Some requirements that I recommend: XBox Gold, a good headset, and a wireless controller. Energy drinks are optional because you'll be playing into the wee early hours of the morning, lol. Other than that, don't sweat getting 'waxed' when you first start playing. There's a learning curve that everyone has to endure. **Note** Please do not buy this game for a kid. There's already enough kiddos who are online playing this that use profanity constantly. 15/16 year olds and above should play this game.",5,0,1,287,1198,28,401,19,6,73.3,6.79,6.78,9.94

"Best online play in a game, great progression for your character in online play. Single player is amazing, but quite short. It has the perfect level of difficulty. New weapons and attachments are amazing. Special Ops provides the co-op experience the last game didn't. It's great fun with a wide variety of mission types.

I'm not a video game player type unless is very user friendly like wii and such.

The graphics are really good. the online multiplayer doesnt live up to what i hoped, theres no real great maps all of them are just ok and a few bad ones the added features are nice with the perks and all the medals you can get.

"I've been playing Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for about a 1 year now. I still enjoy playing it and i think it is a great game. As what I've heard Modern Warfare 2 is supposed to be so good that it makes Modern Warfare look like a joke. So anyways, in my opinion the regular copy of the game is really what you should buy. I'm not saying that the hardened edition and prestige edition is stupid and not worth it. I just think that the regular edition is worth it because it is just the game. The hardened edition is worth it if you want that art book that tells you about the game and the code for cod 1. The prestige edition is worth it if you actually go outside and play games during the night, if you've been wanting night vision goggles for a long time or want an art book. However the copy of the game with the console is completely worth it if your willing to spend the money. it is worth it for many reasons such as: - 250 GB hard drive - if your xbox isnt in good shape - if you want cool looking console designed especially for the game -etc.",5,1,1,212,822,14,277,10,8,74.78,8.1,5.6,11.12

The campaign is half way decent with amazing graphics and some difficulty, though it is pretty easy all together and quick to beat ( 1 week if play regularly). The multiplayer is fun for the first couple of days of play time, but gets old fast and guns get dull quickly! If you want to get achievements easily this game is for you! You will get tired of it fast and it will become a dust collector on your shelf!

"Modern Warfare 2 is an excellent first person shooter. The controls are excellent and fluid. There are three components to the game. One is Special Ops, in which you alone or with a friend via Xbox Live or split-screen clear levels with different objectives. Warning: Veteran Difficulty is insane. The second component is the campaign mode. When compared to the first game, this game's campaign let me down. For one, there are times when it gets confusing. And secondly, you don't really get attached to the new characters that are introduced. The third component is multiplayer mode. This is the highlight of the game. There are 70 levels to level up, ten times if you choose to prestige. There are many challenges and weapon specific challenges that reward you with a title, which you can show off to your friends.",4,1,2,143,654,18,207,13,6,73.21,5.78,8.4,9.43

"Single player game is okay and the storyline is mediocre at best. I finished it in a day or so. It pretty much gets you ready for multiplayer, which is where I have most of my fun. Getting into a match is quick and easy. Wait times are around 1-2 minutes max. Maps are all laid out nicely. Buildings almost always have multiple entrances to keep you on your toes and have plenty of spots to snipe from. Plenty of weapons to choose from with the option to have 5 customizable gear setups. The gameplay is always fun and keeps me coming back for more. Cons: Could have a few more maps. (I'm sure there will be map packs soon) No option to select a map unless you host a private game. No organized system for guilds.",5,0,1,139,559,8,186,12,4,81.87,4.72,5.29,6.94

"I'm writing this review to give you the full Modern Warfare 2 experience.This game is absolutely amazing.5 years after Modern Warfare, Makarov the man loyal to Zakhaev the guy you shot down in COD 4 wants revenge on everybody.An entire nation is duped into military action,and America is invaded by a foreign power.The campaign hops back and forth between the US and overseas.The enemies in cover are well better hidden than in Modern Warfare.Your allies are ready and willing to move up,help check the corners and even prompt you to move forward.The visuals are simply amazing with every scene looking like a major blockbuster movie.Over the course of the story you will infiltrate arctic bases,race to safety on snowmobiles,sprint over slum rooftops in Rio,hold fast food restaurants against invading armies and liberate the White House from enemy hands.The level designs are fantastic from start to finish.Some people might get very offended,but their is a play through were You shoot innocent civilians in a crowded airport.You don't have to play this part of the game if you don't want to.Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer is better than ever before.The big edition is Spec Ops mode.It's a collection of 23 missions designed for two players to battle their way thru.It also shows events that happened elsewhere within the game,as well as in Call Of Duty 4.Competitive multiplayer is what you're familiar with with as in COD 4.Leveling,perks,kill streaks rewards it's all here,and It's been tweaked and rebalanced for a better experience.You're constantly unlocking rewards earning XP for just about everything you do.Completing challenges for new gun attachments,leveling up perks,even opening up custom titles to display along side your name and matches.Kill streaks are now awarded for new vehicles,auto turrets,care packages for random bonuses,even to rain AC-130 from above.For those that play badly you're still rewarded you get a bonus for snapping a scoreless streaks of death.3rd person mode not all that great,you might play it once or twice,but that's it.Modern Warfare 2 is sure to be a game of the year,and it's a first person shooter that every first person shooter junkie should own.Infinity Ward you done it again.",5,1,1,411,1819,49,619,25,8,62.73,8.59,8.42,11.34

The campaign is about 5 hours long on normal and 10 on Veteran but you will enjoy every Minute of it. There is also Special ops which is also great and gives you more game to play. You will be impressed with the online play with all the new maps. There are so many new weapons and theres even a perk that allows you to have 2 primary weapon attachments. Perks can be upgraded. You can now chose you kill streaks to fit the way you play the game and then there are death streaks opposite of kill streaks that will help you out if youre constantly getting killed.

"Most of the criticisms you may have heard about this game do indeed apply. It is simplistic, there is not a strategy element like in the main series games, and it is pretty repetitive. However, you do get to guide hang out with all of your favorite pikmin again (except I have yet to encounter the white ones), and if you play toward the goal of completing all goals for an area, then it can be quite fun and challenging. Most areas have at least two challenges that are optional and do not affect your ability to beat the game. The first challenge is to first discover all 20 pikmin and then to not let any of them die during the level. The second challenge is to discover the hidden artifacts in the levels and retrieve them. Attempting to complete these challenges has caused me to place most levels at least 2 times so far, some even more. Some levels also have secret exits which open an extra level for you. Gameplay is repetitive, but still fun. You tap where you want Olimar to throw the pikmin in a side scrolling universe, and you move Olimar with the circle pad to try to find the exit(s), all the while collecting a little sparklium to help your ship take off and go home. There are 9 sectors. I have not completed them all yet, but according to online guides, there are 5 levels and a boss battle in the first 8 sectors and one boss battle in the 9th. There is no strategy element to speak of in this gameplay, but there is a puzzle solving, and a new element introduced of Olimar having a jetpack. So at times he can jump and fly to place the pikmin cannot go and you must solve a puzzle without them or in a new way other than just throwing them. Amiibos are used in a fun way, but not in a very necessary way. If you have a bunch cluttering up your bathtub, then you can break them out for this. Each Sector has a couple of special one-screen puzzle levels that will unlock when an amiibo is scanned. The scanned amiibo (only Animal Crossing, Pikmin, Splatoon, and Mario Party ones are supported I believe) will appear in game as an artifact and you must figure out how to get the Pikmin or Olimar to collect it. If you do not have any amiibos, then the one made special for this game will act as a randomly chosen amiibo for you when it is scanned. I have not used this feature much, but it would seem all you really need is luck and the Pikmin amiibo for this game to unlock them all. As with all artifacts, there is a funny description unlocked when the amiibo is collected and catalogued. You could easily beat this game without the need for any amiibos, and the only thing you would miss are a couple of one-screen puzzles and a bunch of funny text which you could easily find and read on the internet. You can also use the special pikmin amiibo for this game to cheat in a level, by calling more pikmin to you once per level. So if you had 10 pikmin and accidentally killed 5 but you could not progress any further with only 5, then you could scan the amiibo and more would come to help (amount depends on the level of the amiibo), however, it is clear the game sees this as cheating, because it will not allow you to unlock the special challenge of rescuing all pikmin if you use the amiibo in a level. Lastly, there is a minigame that is not very game like, in which you send the pikmin you have lead to the exit of each level into a top down environment and you leave them to harvest fire, water, crystals, grass, etc in an area and unlock more sparklium for you. It is a very slight attempt at a management sim, but it does provide yet another reason to replay certain levels if you are stockpiling a particular type of pikmin for harvesting purposes. There is a demo for this, if you try it and you feel that you would want to repeat those actions over and over for roughly 40 levels, then this is definitely the game for you.",4,5,2,739,3045,72,1037,27,12,60.34,11.64,7.35,14.85

"Pikmin is my all-time favorite game; I've played it to death. It just has so much mysticism and wonder to it all, combined with stressful but rewarding gameplay that feels very unique compared to what's out there. Hey! Pikmin, on the other hand, feels very bland. It's just a semi-platformer puzzle solver that involves you tapping the screen a lot. There's little to no challenge from what I've played so far (I'm on World 3 now). A lot of the wonder from the original Pikmin series is gone; this feels very soulless.",2,2,1,100,405,7,138,7,5,75.59,6.27,5.94,8.51
"I've played through Pikmin 1, 2, and 3 and loved them all. When I heard that a side-scrolling-spin-off game was in the works I had mixed feelings. After playing the game for a while, I still have mixed feeling about it. Let's start with the good: Despite the low resolution of the 3ds, this game is beautiful - much like the previous titles. It is a joy to look around and see the world. The Pikmin are adorable. Nintendo is so good at making mute characters come to life. The descriptions of the things we use are entertaining. The puzzles are different from most games because it's about launching Pikmin everywhere instead of getting your actual character places. There is still a small amount of managing Pikmin. The game makes you want to explore every part of the levels. On to the bad (and keep in mind, this is in comparison to previous Pikmin games) The game isn't tough at all. You don't get to micro-manage the Pikmin to do different tasks. You don't get the joy of an RTS-like game. I liked being a Pikmin Overlord, sending pikmin all over the map to kill enemies, destroy walls, and haul loot. This just isn't in the game. The Pikmin park has a very small sense of this, but it is nothing in comparison to previous titles. This game is split into a lot of different level (ala mario bros.) which makes the world feel less natural and broken up. It kills the exploration vibe of the series. Thinking about it now, this game could have been made at least thrice as good if it was a metroidvania set-up where Olimar gathers lots of Pikmin from all over and backtrack to previous places to solve puzzles that required more Pikmin or certain types of Pikmin. Exploration would go up, micro-managing would be a thing again, and the world would feel more real. This all being said, this is a good game. It has enough enjoyment in it to warrant $32 (hooray Gamer's Club), but I'm a bit wary of $40 for it. It can be a good introduction to the characters of the series, but in no means is it the same as the others with regards to gameplay.",4,1,0,393,1601,32,537,25,6,75.28,6.66,6.27,9.54

"First off, this game's production value is through the roof. The 1930's art, animation and music style is so on point that it can be a bit eerie at times. It's reminiscent of old Steamboat Mickey, Betty Boop and Popeye cartoons of yore. It looks like you are watching an actual cartoon. However you should know that this is NOT an easy to play game at all. Perhaps one of the hardest games I've played in recent memory. You will probably die at least 10 times before you can clear just one level. My kids wanted to love this game so bad but it literally brought them to tears within the first 20 mins. They were begging for the pain to stop. Now when I mention the name Cuphead they give me a look of pure disgust. That being said, the game's not a lost cause. If you are persistent enough and research gameplay tips via google and youtube you just might be able to clear a level or two. I'd suggest changing your controller scheme if you find the controls funky. Polygon had a pretty good scheme they've shared in an article. My other suggestion is to use your in-game coins wisely. Purchase the 'gas bomb dash' move first, as it's integral to getting through this game. It will allow you to avoid damage as you dash past enemies. Then either get an extra HP or the 'Roundabout' weapon. It takes some getting used to but it's the largest projectile and has a boomerang effect that if held down as you play, will probably randomly save you from cheap kills as you run n' gun your way to the finish line. Last tip is the most important... PINK projectiles and enemies can be parried. In this game you NEED to Parry ALL the time in order to build up your power shots and even quickly revive a pal whos been 'ghosted'. My very last tip is to remember the enemy patterns as you go through levels. The bosses have patterns too but some are randomized. These are just a few minor tips, but honestly the only way to succeed in this game. So just understand this will NOT be an easy game. At all. But! If you give it some practice you will be able to stay long enough to enjoy it's charm. The developers actually hand drew everything and recorded actual live jazz bands to make this as authentic as possible to the 1930's cartoon style, and for that I give this game a fifth star. I love the idea and am planning to do my best at finishing it. But it'll take a lot of convincing to get my kids to even look at the game again.

Pillars of Eternity seems to TAKE an eternity to play. This is a game with no artistic direction, zero cinematography, a game with laughably bad graphics, a game with virtually zero visual pyrotechnics-- and yet I can handle all that. The story is pedestrian, slow, and requires you to read tiny, unfulfilling text at every corner, at least when the D-minus voice acting isn't piercing your brain. Yet I can handle all that, too. Where I draw the line is laboriously slow, unfulfilling, tedious combat which requires you to cycle through every one of your party members and all of their commands just to go ONE round of a battle. Multiply this by dozens for longer battles and, well, I was screaming into my controller by day two of this game. This is not a game made for consoles, and it shows glaringly and unflinchingly. Simply changing someone's armor is a rigamarole that puts several different windows in your face at once, occasionally blocking the armor itself.

"I ike these games a great deal. TBOGT is funner in my opinion, but you will enjoy them both. It is fun to see Niko's story connect with these, and see favorite characters return. Motorcycles mechanics have been improved for TLAD which eliminate the need to even want to drive a car. Some animations have been tweaked as well, for better or worse. Overall, if you love the world of GTAIV, you can not go wrong with these two great expansions.",5,2,0,82,349,9,114,6,6,75.35,6.14,7.06,9.86

Wasn't too big on the Biker side of this game but the ballad of gay Tony was excellent.",5,1,0,77,315,6,107,8,3,79.5,4.56,5.18,6.97

The stories are just so-so, BoGT is much better than LaD. The riding on the motorcycles is much better than in GTA4, but overall there is just something lacking in the general gameplay. Helicopter fighting is fun, but doesn't make up for the rest of the sub-par gaming. Overall it is nice to have an extension of the GTA saga, but the graphics are of such poor quality compared to GTA4 that for me this was a step backward by Rockstar.",3,1,3,114,459,10,154,6,8,73.27,7.76,6.32,11.11

"Capcom has actually gone, and done it. They created good modern Mega Man after all these years. You can feel the inspiration from the original series in the level design, character design, and activities. The boss fights all feel retro and modern at the same time. Just a wonderful game. While it borrows a lot from it's legacy, there are tons of quality of life additions to make the game accessible to everyone. It can be an easy romp, or challenging buster only run if you choose. There should be a sweet spot of challenge and fun you can make your own.",5,2,0,103,441,13,149,8,6,71.38,6.5,7.08,10.2
"I'm a huuuuge fan of Mega Man so I was stoked when I heard about this new entry. Gameplay is classic Mega Man and the new additions (double gear) come across well and don't feel gimmicky. The game is HARD too... although there are 'easy' modes available for newcomers to the series as well. The only thing I was a little disappointed with is the music.... it's not bad, but overall the songs just aren't as catchy and melodic as a lot of the previous Mega Man games were. I do really like the alternate soundtrack that was available via preorder though.",5,2,0,106,431,12,155,7,6,67.76,7.57,6.15,10.59
"Finally we get a modern Mega Man game with a decent graphical treatment. However, Mega Man 11 plays it a bit too safe. Most of the tropes of old make it back here, but not much else. After the initial 8 bosses, the Doctor Wily stage isn't particularly long (just 2 stages with a boss rush and then Wily himself with 2 forms). The new Double Gear system is a winner and does add some newness to the formulaas you can essentially speed up or add a power boost at willbut there's no real secrets to speak of, and Rush seems to take a backseat this time around with nothing new added to his abilities (all you get here is the stock Rush Spring and Rush Jet). After the main game is over, there are a series of challenges you can complete to add some replay value, though only the most hardcore of Mega Man fans will likely have the patience to tackle these with gusto. Despite this, if Mega Man 11 is any indication of things to come, the future is looking bright for the blue bomber!",4,2,0,190,772,11,261,7,12,63.07,11.21,7,13.17
"Pros: - Mega Man is back in action with new graphics and a modern twist - Not full game price - I love the new art direction of the series - I really enjoyed the English voice acting (which I understand some might not agree) - The game is very fun and the new mechanics is awesome (It does not alienate long time fans at all) Cons: - Would have wanted that the Ps4 version came with a special edition - At least a manual/booklet - Soundtrack is good but not the best in the series - Would have wanted Capcom to explore more with the story (It's not a big issue though since Classic MM games always had simple plots)",4,1,0,114,476,6,153,1,56,-22.42,44.71,8.49,47.71

At the time I ordered, at the time the product shipped, and still right now, the pictures show and the write up says it comes with a 'canvas carrying case' but the case is a really poor quality nylon that just looks like it'll tear if I try to carry anything in it. If I bought the game alone I'd give it a 4. It's really fun but really buggy and desperately needs the improvements they say they're working on, but when a product's description straight out LIES about what it contains I have to give it a 1. In case the product page changes, here's what it currently says, 'West Tek Canvas Carrying Bag'.",1,6,0,156,605,14,209,6,10,67.1,10.36,5.87,13.99
"This is not a game. It's not even an alpha build of a game. Fallout 76 is just boring. Empty world, tons of bugs, and repeated server crashes are just some of the issues I had. Playing with friends can at times be fun, but it's not a reason to justify how broken the game is. I can't recommend this game at all, even if you're a huge fan of the previous fallout games. The helmet is cool. But not worth $200. I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of this title and Bethesda will need to gain back my trust before I invest any time or money into another product they release.",1,6,0,117,450,10,159,9,4,78.67,5.52,4.54,8.62

"A great deal for $80, a terrible deal at $219. The helmet is molded plastic, the voice changer does not deliver on its intended feature. That said, it looks really cool.

No one wants to team up, and no one wants to pvp. So what your left is just vast emptiness with no npcs to compensate. I don't think I'll play it for a couple of months until the majority of bugs are fixed. The 'collectible figures' inside felt like some really cheap 99 cent toys you would buy kids from the groceries.

"The game itself is fun when it works but frustrating when it decides to glitch out or crash. Been playing it since release date and overall i been mostly playing with without too many interruptions. I have gotten disconnected from the the servers about 4 times and that was mainly during crafting, they should get rid of that workstation animation. Doing co-op with my friend has been mostly simple and straight forward, we did run into an issue where i could not do a quest because i did not receive quest clothes. Overall i think this game is rough around the edges and definitely needs more work, probably in a year it will be working way better but right now, only the most hardcore of fallout fans might want to bear through it.",4,1,1,134,591,11,187,5,13,61.57,11.33,9.03,14
"I currently have 106 hours playing Fallout 76. The game has bugs and Bethesda is working on fixing them. Aside from the bugs I am really enjoying this game and have played it completely solo. This game is not the typical Fallout game and plays differently its more of a online survival mmo hybrid except has a storyline and quests littered all over the place. Those who say it has no story clearly have not played this game. The overall map is huge with endless things to explore. If youre looking for a complete single player typical Fallout experience You May or may not like this game. I personally am a huge Fallout fan but also a creature of habit and really enjoy grindy RPGs and crafting type games so that does affect my positive opinion towards Fallout 76. 80% of the community probably does not agree with my opinion and most diehard Fallout fans are pretty upset about this game not being Fallout 5. On to the actual physical product the Power Armor helmet is nice though the voice modulator is a bit weak and you can hear yourself over it. The bag is not canvas as described it is nylon so not as durable and feels cheap. The toy soldiers are pretty neat if your into small plastic figurines and the map is well just a map that does glow in the dark. Overall I think this should have been priced more in the $150 range than $200.",4,0,1,250,1076,27,363,13,9,64.48,9.04,7.97,12.01
"First off I will start by saying that yes the game has some bugs. What online game hasnt launched with bugs. I personally find this game to be enjoyable playing either solo or with a group. I did find that it is much more enjoyable in a group. There is a lot of exploration in this game. It did take some time getting use to not having npc's telling me where to go but I quickly got over that. Also the stash limit is a non factor. I kicked my hoarding tendencies to the side and only stash what I'll need. Weapons and armor that are lower level I just scrap and move on. I would say if you have a group of friends that love fallout pick up this game and it a chance. I'm sure with future updates new content will come out and there will be plenty of things to do.",4,0,2,157,597,6,195,11,4,87.27,4.63,4.49,7.24

In many ways, a fresh lick of paint is all thats needed the base game remains a winner and its idiosyncratic spirit still feels fresh.",5,1,0,84,378,10,128,2,21,35.29,18.77,9.96,21.56

It puts me in the mind of Final Fantasy Tactics a little bit. I think its more chaotic though. There are so many layers to this game. It can be somewhat overwhelming.

"My first exposure to Disgea was Disgea 5 complete on Switch which is also great(I rate it higher). I'm no Disgea expert and I've barely leveled my characters in 5, but I liked it so much that when I heard they were releasing Disgea 1 I knew it was a day one purchase for me. Now playing 1 a bit I have to say that it is great fun but I do miss some of the game play improvements made in 5. I was hoping for a remake using the 5 engine with the newer updated graphics and quality of life improvements. It is not that. From what I can tell and read about it is mostly just a graphics update. Don't get me wrong I still recommend it but I suggest if you are new to Disgea, play it first before 5 as it feels clunkier in its systems. For those new to the game it is a Tactical RPG where you control a group of units that fight turn based on a grid system. It allows crazy unit levels and progression with very deep systems that you don't actually really have to figure out if you don 't want to. It even has a character that flat out tells you you don't have to know the systems to beat the game. The almost infinite leveling and fun storyline and characters make for a good time.",4,1,0,243,919,20,323,11,8,71.96,8.71,5.1,12.13

Just figured they finally put some small 3D open areas in dungeons (which they did in F.E. Echoes, but it wasnt released at the time). Nope, I got Dynasty Warriors with FE characters, and some extra abilities added in. Was very disappointed as FE is my favorite game line of all time.

"Game is a remake/remaster of the first Senran Kagura that released on 3DS years back. The changes include shifting from a 2D side scrolling perspective to fully 3D realized world as well as some extras to more or less justify the re-release. Though be warned, if you are into for the fan-service, the main feature was stripped at the request of Sony and you'd be better off with the Steam Edition. That said, my real overall score is 3.5 stars because of this. Its what made Senran Senran in the first place and considering all the other things allowed on the platform, it just feels like censorship than actual quality control but I digress. I still decided to buy it and support the devs as this was not their fault and I much prefer to keep the collection together on console and I'll wait for a sale on PC.",4,5,0,155,646,15,213,7,10,68.1,9.26,7.37,12.73

"Yes, the PS4 version removed the intimacy mode. But, looking at the game for what it is, it's a good way for people who never played the first Senran game to experience the origins of the story. Gameplay is fast paced and the graphics, though running on the same engine as Estival Versus, look like a slight step up the previous games. The visual novel cutscenes can go on for a bit too long, however, and the story focuses on a few characters too much, leaving the others a little neglected.

"I was especially excited about getting this in my hands, seeing as I was a fan of the Battle Chasers comic in the mid-90's. The game starts well enough, which a fantastic art style (expected!), and compelling characters. Over time however, the story becomes a bore - predictable and unexciting. The gameplay is engaging, with a unique combat system, but with no compelling story to drive your quest from point A to point B (it feels very very linear at times), there just isn't a reason to see what the next dungeon holds. Good enough fun for a while, but buy it on sale.",3,1,0,106,446,13,156,6,8,64.4,8.67,7.26,11.97
"Battle Chasers hit a lot of nostalgic points for me, reminding me of my times playing the older Final Fantasy games, or other similar JRPGs from back in the day (Robotrek anyone?). The game consists of a lot of tactical choices, and a fairly streamlined skill tree system to power up your combat skills. The skill tree system doesn't lock in, allowing you to mix and match your skills and figure out the play-style you like while you play. The only complaints, and these weren't enough to knock of a star, is that the game can feel a bit grindy at times, characters who aren't in your party don't level, and if you go searching for treasure you may out-level the game making it almost too easy. Still, it was a great ride and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys old-school JRPGs.",5,1,0,151,618,11,203,6,11,67.56,10.09,7.09,12.98

"First off, this game is nothing like Monster Hunter World. Going back to the traditional art style that Capcom always had for the Monster Hunter series, this game is just as tough as the original games. Has a much wider-range of monsters and armor sets to collect along with all 14 weapon types. If you're coming from Monster Hunter World, this version is not as easy, but has a lot more content to offer. With an included G-Rank that increases the AI and strength of monsters, the game will really test your monster hunting skills. Definitely not a game your 'average gamer' can just pick up and play, but definitely worth the investment. Has tons of replay value. I have over 600 hours in Monster Hunter World and that game barely has any content (although all updates are free). This game is nearly 2 or 3 times the size of MHWorld. For all you previous MH fans/vets. I definitely recommend!",5,13,8,164,710,13,231,11,7,72.54,6.85,7.67,9.13
"If you've played any of what would now be called 'Classic' Monster Hunter, you know roughly what you're getting into with Generations Ultimate's main gameplay loop. A solid action game with a highly satisfying combat system that circles into a Diablo-esque loot 'grind'. If you've never played a Monster Hunter, I am a tad hesitant to recommend this as your first. I would say to try World if you have a PS4/XBox/PC, or 4 Ultimate if you have a 3DS. Generations and Generations Ultimate don't do too well to explain everything, and a new player could easily be overwhelmed. Generations Ultimate is the final game (as of now) in the classic Monster Hunter formula, and it knows it as it brings more Monsters into one game than ever before. Monsters, Locations, Weapons, Armor, and more from across the entire series have returned for one of the most content-packed releases Capcom have ever put out. Though it may seem funny to others, one of the largest additions for me personally is the ability to 'transmog' armor. That is to say, wear a piece of armor for skills, but have it look like another piece you like the looks of more. No clown suits just to have your favorite skills! The game plays wonderfully on TV and in Handheld. All-in-all, Generations Ultimate is well worth the price.",5,3,0,236,1021,26,346,12,9,62.84,9.38,8.13,12.27

"As a veteran hunter (played Monster Hunter since the Playstation 2 days), I have played every Monster Hunter game that has come to the US (Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Freedom, Freedom 2, Freedom Unite, Tri, 3 Ultimate, 4 Ultimate, Generations) and have also played Monster Hunter Portable 3rd (Japan's Monster Hunter Freedom 3) and have loved the entire premise behind Capcom's slaughterhouse grind fest of defeating various creatures, endless crafting options, and various strengths and weaknesses of monsters, whether it be a Wyvern, Elder Dragon, Fanged Beast, Piscine Wyvern, etc. This game is a continued Generations experience (which is awesome as you can transfer your Generations data from your 3DS to Generations Ultimate and get some cool bonuses; the Deviants that were added here makes it sweeter (Diablos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, Astalos to name a few) and also being able to fight my oldest nemesis (of sorts) Lao-Shan Lung is a treat for me -the addition of the Brave and Alchemy styles add more possibilities and great combinations to hunting teams; for me, I stick to Adept Sword and Shield due to the evasion + mounting combination; while I may not do a lot of damage compared to Great Sword at times, it's ability to mount makes it easier to set up mounts and extra damage after toppling the monster. I admit I was a little disappointed that we didn't get a new weapon; was hoping to see a new one to be honest but at the same time, the styles do make some weapons that were 'underpowered/useless' become able to shine very well and even make overpowering weapons even more 'broken' Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10 for my scale, but for this scale of 1-5 I'll have to give it a 5/5; great game, fast-paced, strategic fighting especially when solo, great monsters new and old; the only thing that I wish they would have done (which for me would have secured 10/10 for me) would be to add EVERY single monster from EVERY generation and bring them ALL to Generations Ultimate as I feel that would definitely make the game live up to its name; my opinion Despite that, this game is a must-own for the switch in my opinion as someone who has played all the regular games (and played a couple spin-offs like Monster Hunter Stories); if you love fighting different varieties of monsters, having cats as friends who help you, and just flat-out battling monsters alongside friends, this game is for you",5,2,0,432,1921,46,640,3,72,-64.66,58.05,10.14,61.86

"Let me say right of the bat: Monster Hunter World, is a step in the right direction. This game is really fun, and a great way to 'catch up' with all things monster hunter. However you'll find as I have that you never realize how good a few quality of life upgrades can be for a game until you actually experience them first hand. I've played every single monster hunter game and I love everything about the series as a whole. That being said I really wish this didn't come out so close to world because other than monsters this game really doesn't have anything that I can say it does better than world. It cant be fairly compared to world because this is a celebration of past monster hunters not the latest chapter in the story that is monster hunter.

"My experience with Monster Hunter is still very fresh as prior to MHGU the only game I had played was Monster Hunter World which also came out recently. I do however have about 500 hours in MHW currently and I still play it. It should be noted however that MHGU is very different then World in many ways. World was designed to be a AAA experience for the mainstream consumer. GU is an english port of Monster Hunter XX (Double Cross) which came out in Japan before World. MHGU represents the 'Ultimate' experience of the old handheld MH titles, with a staggering number of monsters, weapons styles, weapon arts, and other features. However this game can be much less inviting to new players as it was mostly designed to be the pinnacle MH game for MH vets. That doesn't mean however that new players can't enjoy it, it just means you will have to do some extra work to break through the games many obtuse systems. That may not be everyone cup of tea but the people who stick with the game and watch guide videos online will discover an amazingly fun game loop with hundreds and hundreds of hours of things to do.",5,3,2,206,889,19,291,9,11,64.1,10.01,8.28,12.84

"This is a pretty fun game, but it's very obviously a port from the DS. I was hoping more for an open world Breath of the Wild type game, but with huge monsters to fight . (Kinda of like Monster Hunter Tri, which was released for the Wii U.) However, this is more 'I want to go fight this monster. Here is a closed area with somewhere between 3 and 10 rooms. The monster will be in there.' Plus, there are loading screens between each room. It's fun enough, but it's kind of clunky for a current generation console. That being said, if you're into a lot of different types of combat, this is the game for you. There's at least 10 hours of training, easy. (You don't have to do them, but they are there.) Plus a LOT more monsters than there are on Monster Hunter World (which was released on Xbox and Playstation). All in all, this is a pretty decent game, with LOTS of hours of play on it, but it feels a little dated for a modern console.",3,1,5,187,717,7,239,13,4,84.11,5.1,4.69,7.25

"I'm a newcomer to MH. I've never played any of the games in the franchise. I always wanted to dip a toe in, but have been wary due to the countless comments about it being way hardcore. Turns out, it ticks every one of my addiction boxes. The gameplay loop of village > prep > hunt > craft/upgrade > village is very tight, but the story is barebones (I guess other games in the series have a more fleshed out story, but all I know from the 40 hours I've put in so far is that monsters have body parts I need to make cool looking armor, so I better do quests where I hunt those monsters if I want the cool armor). Unlike traditional MMO's, your character doesn't level up and get more stats. You can upgrade your gear, and get buffs from items and meals, but your ability to take down the giant monsters relies mostly on your personal skill. With the many potential combinations of weapons, styles, and equipable arts, there's guaranteed to be a playstyle for everyone (right now I'm playing Dual Swords, Aerial style, but have dabbled with a LBG Striker). Love the fact that the single player is perfectly adequate, and that the multiplayer experience has both local and network play. I just wish more of my friends would get on board so I could have someone to take down these giant monsters with.",5,0,1,244,1019,20,340,10,11,64.18,10.37,7.54,13.04

"If you enjoyed the previous Dead Space games, you'll be sure to enjoy Dead Space 3. The most polished, well-paced entry in the excellent sci-fi horror series yet. Bringing a friend along for two-player co-op is a blast. Snow crumbles beneath Isaacs boots, necromorphs are disgustingly detailed, and the backdrops are stunning. Solid voice acting sells the drama, and the cries of enemies are appropriately unsettling. The new weapon-crafting system and roll dodge make it easy to play the way you want to play. The environments are moody and the gameplay is without a hitch. This is one of the best horror games Ive ever played. A fantastic game.",5,5,1,115,518,10,167,9,7,71.01,6.53,8.37,8.59
"I'm a fan of Dead Space through and through, and this one definitely is a must-buy in my opinion if you enjoy horror/action games. Firstly, there's plenty of new features that the predecessors didnt have before. Single-player co-op is a definite plus. You will experience completely different when you play alone rather than when you play co-op. Dimentia and psychological factors play a huge factor here since for one person they could be walking into a seemingly eerie quiet room, and then your co-op partner could be screaming bloody murder because his character is hallucinating a nightmare. All of this trickles down from an immensely well written original storyline. This time around there are optional side-missions which add to the experience, and there's plenty of small features which make it all worth the buy. 8.5/10 for me.",5,4,1,149,676,17,227,9,9,61.14,8.84,9.09,11.19

"If you love challenges and the series of 'Dead Space', this is for you. I recommend you play the first two games before playing this one. If you don't you'll get lost as to what's going on in the story-line. The graphics are amazing with a few imperfections (every game has them). The story line is amazing, with a great plot twist in it. Co-op mode makes the game more enjoyable but less challenging. There's an achievement where you need a co-op partner. As to what's bad about it, it doesn't have split-screen so you can't play with a buddy. Other than that it's a great game all around. If you play non-stop I'd say it'll take you a week to beat it. Very great at passing time. Great game.",5,2,0,145,530,8,180,12,2,89.55,3.77,3.24,7.04

"A great example of how not to infuse co-op in your game. I picked this up for about $20 after I played the previous two games, but soon discovered that unless you are playing co-op it is impossible to complete the game with all side missions, collectibles and weapon upgrades. The story and gameplay are just so-so, unless you got a buddy with you ready to tackle the co-op sections then don't bother.",2,1,0,78,317,7,110,3,11,61.14,11.19,6.96,13.99

Hideo Kojimas vision has been fully realized within every aspect of this game - from the detailed realistic graphics, spot-on voice acting, mood-inducing atmospheric and ambient sounds, the soundtrack, but most importantly ... the story. Gameplay was flawless, with not a glitch to be found (as of my first play-through). With the release of this game, I finally have a reason to begin gaming again. And Im taking my time, to see and experience everything, the world of Death Stranding has to offer. Thank you Mr. Kojima!",5,1,0,109,501,14,166,8,8,64.17,7.69,9.05,10.59
"This Collector's Edition is pretty dang cool. Especially if you're a fan of Hideo Kojima, or the Metal Gear series. I'm not so sure about the price tag, as it's $200 price is a tad steep unless you're a true 'ride or die' fan. The game itself is an amazing experience so far. The items included were all made with care, and it's definitely an interesting set if you're a FAN. The box is hefty, so finding a spot to store everything could prove difficult, but once again if you're a fan of new, fresh, original narratives, and an engrossing experience. This is for you! I say just go with the game, it's well worth it. If you happen to come across this set and love Death Stranding, and have $200 to spare. I say buy it up!",5,1,0,147,552,15,198,10,4,77.96,6.04,4.27,9.96
"I was a little skeptical at first with this game. Everything I've read makes it sound like a walking simulator. I'm a huge fan of Kojima, and have played every Metal Gear game dating all the way back to the 80's when I was a kid. Kojima is a master story teller, and I was excited to see what he would do with this game. Simply put, I love it. This isn't a game that is high on action set pieces. It's not trying to be. What this game is, however, is a breathtaking take on life and death. The writing is superb, the acting is insane, and I'm not quite sure what genre the game is meant to be. At times I was genuinely afraid of my surroundings in the game due to not being able to see with certainly where the 'BT's' were at. (I guess the closest thing I could compare them to would be a ghost?) At others I remember standing on the top of a mountain and wondering how Kojima's studio was able to make the game so dang beautiful. The grass, the rock, the mountains, and the water all had me fooled at times thinking it was real. The story starts off slow, but I'd say it picks up at chapter 3 and then doesn't slow down. Do yourself a favor and play this game. It's more something you 'experience' than you 'play,' and will keep you thinking long after you put the controller down.",5,1,0,262,985,18,339,16,5,80.75,6.06,4.5,9.3
"Collector's edition with the BB replica is awesome. I wish they would have made it a glass replica instead of plastic, but still really well made. However the game itself is ok. No doubt the mechanics used in this game, and the way they keep throwing stuff at you to improve on it, with the main them being sort of a walking-simulation-based-gameplay is amazing. However, its not fun if you are expecting to get an adrenaline-surge out of it. It you pick this game up thinking its a action-game, by now you know it is not. The only thing that kept me going is the story. It is simply worth playing for. Or simply just go to youtube and watch its cinematics. I think Kojima created an amazing sci-fi world which begged to be made into something more than just fetch-based quests. There was so much potential in the world created, and could have easily been made into one of the best action-packed adventure. Opportunity missed and it really disappointed me.",3,1,0,180,759,25,258,12,6,70.35,7.17,7.02,11.56
"This game is a slow burn. It sounds a bit reductive but if you are the type that like call of duty-esque balls to the wall action, then you wont find much here for you. But if you dont mind the slow burn story heavy games, I think there is a lot for you here. It takes some time to get going but once it does you wont want to stop. The Special edition is pretty darn good too. I am getting tired of just an action statue of the MC, so this was refreshing. The BB pod is neat and lights up, and the case is decently heavy duty. I only really have two complaints. The case is very plain, there are no stickers or molded insignia so it seems like a generic case rather than something from the game, as well, the handle is fixed and does not fold down, so storage is a bit odd. Second, the screw on the pds battery case was nearly stripped. If i didnt have the right tool for it, I may not have been able to put batteries in. Overall, a neat and somewhat unique special edition, and a great game that wont be for everyone.",5,1,0,206,789,12,262,12,6,81.81,6.11,5,9.2

I am playing it on Normal mode and it is a bit hard to tread through the gameplay for the first 3 chapters. After that there are no limits as to how you can traverse the open world. If you find yourself having trouble with the gameplay I IMPLORE YOU to switch the game to 'Very Easy Mode' to get through and view this amazing story.",5,1,0,99,401,9,137,5,8,69.67,8.46,6.52,11.56
"Great game if you're the type who enjoys art and game design. This game will upset gamers who typically are into fortnite or COD and more action pact games. If you didnt have the patience to sneak around in previous metal gear solid games. This isn't the game for you. This game has a lot of funny moments and can get chaotic. The people who claim it to be a walking simulator are actually right. This game challenges the player to trail different terrain levels while balancing load on their back. While doing this there are different mechanics that get in the way like rainfall that will damage your packages, environmental hurdles and stamina, fatigue, superficial ghosts. This game will throw every inconvenient thing after you to make going from point A to point B a challenge. On top of that you do get various tools to help you for yourself like guns, grenades, vechicles. This game will easily take up more than 30 hrs your first playthrough so definitely worth the buy I'd you weigh gameplay time into your purchase. A lot of detail is put into this game design wise You don't get a lot of that in most action/shooter games which are pretty redundant these days.",5,1,0,214,941,23,304,12,9,68.55,8.13,8.4,11.43

"I've been hitting my head ever since I pre-ordered this. I knew it would all be made in China and essentially nothing is directly made from Kojima Productions (except the game). I knew it wouldn't really be worth it in the end and it's essentially for the rich people who can afford to spend money left and right. I do not have such luxuries and was just contemplating to return it and just buy air pods since it's that time of year to save a few dollars. But this is Kojima's biggest release after dealing with a bad break up and I think over time the worth of this video game and the collector's edition will definitely be worth it. I think the big briefcase, the steelbook, and the mascot keychain were the best items. The BB pod was indeed a big let down but I think that's why we got the big roll of tape so that we could decorate the BB pod how we really wanted; and knowing Kojima, he probably intended on this as well.

"OK, let me start off by telling you the bad, me and a couple friends got a sneak peak at the game and there are no airplanes ): ! anyways heres how i works... you no longer frive to missions, you dial up your cellphone with contacts you recive along the way. That is also how you access multiplayer! As you know liberty city is designed after New York City, although ground zero is NOT included nor any asppect of 9/11. What interested me a lot is that to hijack a car you must first break the window with your elbow and then hotwire it. Now to the WANTED, it will no longer be stars. It will be a radius (a circle) that appears on your mini map. The bigger it gets the more 'stars' you have. Next, the game will be loaded with a BUNCH BUNCH BUNCH of mini-games. What I loved so much about the sneak peak was the taxi ride. It was real time and you have a view from the backseat. If your wondering how you decide where to go?... a map fills the screen then you point anywhere. Now I saved this one for last because I didn't know how you would react... THE RPG HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT! that means you can no longer get fat or any other attributes/abilities. I dont see why they did this but it did get annoying. I don't know whether there will be cheats or not because I had none to enter. Please report this as helpful so I can post further reviews.",5,66,8,268,1036,16,350,20,4,82.75,5.05,4.72,7.75
"After 89 missions and about 20-25 hours of non-continuous gameplay, I finally beat the game. It was absolutely fantastic. The drama that carries on throughout the game(I'm not giving anything away) make you feel as if you are personally Niko Belic. It's so life-like it's not even funny, and at the end I actually felt kinda bad for what Niko had to go through. I WILL say you get so close to Roman as if you're actually his cousin in real life then it's all taken away.. About the rest.. You have friends and you have a girlfriend and you can do things with them as you can in real life(bowling, darts, strip clubs, eat, drinking, etc.). One more thing I love about the game are how the missions are actually based on events that can/do actually happen in real life.

Its got everything that NY has. For example The Stastue of Liberty is The Stastue of Happieness. Anyway, you explore 3 different islands. I am not really sure what their names are though. This game does take take realistic to a whole new level by having a 5 out of 5 graphic team. Also by the killing affects. For example you can run over people and they fly all over the place. Also if there is a car on fire and you get near the fire your clothes are set a flame and you roll on the ground. Overall GTA4 is a great game. There is only 1 problem, you can't save games at any time, you have to go to the safe house. =(",5,20,3,179,709,15,241,15,4,80.82,4.95,5.01,8.13
"Ever since I was about 8 I discovered Grand Theft Auto. It Actually started with The Second Grand Theft Auto. One of my brothers friends, played it. I never asked to play, until one day my brother brought home Grand Theft Auto 3. I asked him if I could try. I did, Went absolutely insane with the gun. It is horrible actually. I just shot every random person. Than he bought Vice City. I loved it too. Years later, I met a friend in 7th grade, I went to his house, was playing a video game, He was playing Vice City. I screamed and begged him for me to try it. I haven't played since I was 9. than He also had San Andrea's. Than the same friend reserved Grand Theft Auto 4. I was freaking out, especially when he got it. I played it with him. Once I think I played it for 3 days straight. Today, I bought my own, and I'm playing it as I type this. I can seriously either pass missions, or if I'm bored I'll go into a park, and beat people up. Its a good, good game just, Its a little addictive. Especially when It's summer.",5,27,11,209,779,10,271,22,1,87.5,3.42,3,5.71
"The only problem i found in this game, is that first, the city is not even half the size of San Andreas(GTA), and that you unlock all the are before reaching %50 of finishing the game! But the graphics, music, cars(you CAN steal cars and bikes directly from the agency!), Missions, Weapons! and length is great!!! Worth 40 bucks, believe me. Though there's a small chance that you get bored before finishing the game.",5,14,1,77,322,4,102,6,5,81.74,5.05,6.48,7.21

"Grand theft auto 4 is one of those games that makes me marvel at how much detail got put into it. It's such a big game but so much close attention was paid to make it play well and look good as well. The graphics are great. Liberty City is fully realized city with tons of people and traffic. Its one of the most impressive cities in a game that I have seen. It truly feels alive. The story is great overall. The main character is Niko Belic, a russian immigrant that arrives to the US on a ship. From there you pretty much work with all kinds of shady folk in order to make money. Niko has his motives that he works toward throughout the game. He's an interesting character and his story is an interesting one to play through. Its a lengthy one as well. If I had to say the one thing I think rockstar nailed down almost perfectly in this game I would have to say the physics. From the people to the vehicles in the game everything reacts in such realistic way. It's very apparent to how much attention went in to making everything act realistically. Each car has its own kind of physics. Trucks are heavy so they will plow through other vehicles a lot easier than cars. Different cars have better handling than others making it so you have to adjust to the weight of each one to get turning down. When a pedestrian is hit. They will react realistically. If you clip their leg or arm they will jolt and whip around in a violent way. If you hit them straight on they will fold on top of your hood in a very gruesome spectacle. To put it simply its the best ragdoll effect that I have seen in a game. Even today. If you shoot an enemy they will react accordingly. And each weapon has its own power to it. If you shoot someone in the leg while they are running they will topple to the ground. My favorite is shooting their leg while they are climbing steps. What follows is an amusingly realistic topple down the stairs. If you take advantage of the physics in the game you will have a lot of fun watching what happens in each segment of the game. The missions in this game are very well done overall. Some of them aren't that great and sometimes leave you wondering what the point of it was but for the most part they take advantage of the strong points in the game. My favorite mission of all time is in the game. It involves a bank heist and has you running from the cops trying to escape. It's just awesome. There is a great addition the the gta series that helps immensely in missions: the cover system. This mechanic works well. Niko is able to snap into cover easily almost anywhere. Behind cars, dumpsters, walls, etc. While in cover he can aim, pop up, shoot and repeat. This makes firefights a lot more enjoyable than the ones from past gta games. Once you have completed the single-player campaign you can hop into some of the most entertaining multiplayer available. There are a bunch of different game modes to play including team deathmatch and you can play them throughout the whole city or you can choose a section of it to play in. You can have up to 16 players in a match. I did give this game 5 stars but I don't think this game is perfect. There is pop in every now and then that can get annoying sometimes. Combat in tight spaces doesn't work all that well and can result in some frustrating deaths. And Nikos movements are a little too stiff for my tastes. These complaints are minor, however. This game is just an awesome package. I recommend it.",5,9,1,663,2745,54,896,51,5,79.31,5.43,6.27,8.46
"This game is great. It is suitable for the whole family. It is not as inapropriate as evryone says. You do not have to do the bad things, that is optional. The only thing you have to do is when you do the campain you may have to take care of some drug dealers. But who cares about drug dealers. They are bad people. In this game you are actually cleaning the streats of mean people. You have to do this with use of force, of couse. But, sometimes you dont achieve your goals without some force. Like, if you tried to talk to a person who was about to shoot you, you would be dead. But if you kicked the gun out of the person's hand and tackled him/her to the ground you would have a better chance. I'm just saying that all the bad things that they say are in this game are optional. It is also a very fun game. You can really do anything you want. You can fly a helicopter then jump out over water and emerge unharmed. Great game, do not imediatly think it is to inapropriate.",5,7,0,196,758,13,253,17,3,85.93,4.14,4.37,7.26

"Grand Theft Auto IV is really one of the best games in a very long time. It has extremely good graphics that make things very real. Of course on a game this big there are going to be a few clipping problems, but nothing that really detracts from the feel of the game. The game play and storyline are great. You can obviously beat the main game in under 30 hours (Its one of the achievements), but there are so many more side missions to do that it really can keep you playing for well, days, hours at a time years hopefully, but probably not. The sound track to this game is immense; as you are driving there is about 9 different radio stations with 24 min of music/talking on each one. There is a lot, and I mean a lot of swearing in this game so I advise not playing this in front of the younger people, or buying it for them. The driving in the game is although a little loose and easy to go out of control, once you get the hang of it and start driving nicer cars then you really dont have to worry much about it. Airplanes are gone (thank goodness) but you can still fly helicopters. You can play Darts, pool, bowling, go to a cabaret club, and even a comedy club. At the beach you can take a look through one of those magnify things that you see on piers all the time. For vigilante mode you actually access the police computer from the car and find the whereabouts of the crook. There are car races and getting the specific types of cars for people. Also, as always the hidden packages (which I think are pigeons in this game) and stunt jump spots. A nice new addition to this game is that it is a little more modern. You get a cell phone that you can setup having a drink with your friends or inviting your girlfriend to play a game of bowling. Also, you can go online at the Internet caf and browse the internet (its all built into the game, but there is a huge amount of different websites to visit) or check your e-mail. As you can see there is a lot of fun to be had with this game even if you dont follow through the storyline, or want to deviate at all. There is also a great online multiplayer mode that you can do a lot of the same with the free roam, also, death match style things. Unfortunately I cant say much about the online yet because I have not played it too much, but what I have seen is a lot of fun. I say if you enjoy any of the GTA games, or any of the other sandbox style game series then you will love this one. Try it out!",5,4,0,488,1917,33,636,22,9,74.06,8.44,5.96,11.58

"I'm a big fan of the GTA series. This game only made me more of a fan after being a bit let down by San Andreas. First off, you can interact with nearly EVERYTHING in this city. You can pick up a brick and hurl it at an enemy, find numerous small alleyways with a fire escape you can run up, and find side missions with average people on the street. The missions are very fun, and start you off small. And when I say small, I mean it! One mission involves throwing a brick through a window, haha. But eventually you get up to the big ones like bank heists, large drug deals and assassinations. The theme of this game is centered around revenge, unlike trying to amass wealth, as is the central theme in most other GTA's. It also plays a part in some missions, where you have to decide whether or not your victim will die. You can choose to let them live and possibly interact with them later on in the game. This feature allows for even more replay-ability. I might start up a new game and change my paths this time. The only drawbacks are: 1. If you're just goofing around and trying to die in amusing ways, the death camera lasts way too short thanks to it being in VERY slow motion (we all know you want to see Niko fly headfirst into a building and then land on a car on the street). 2. The story is pretty good, but it could've lasted longer. I felt like this was a quick story to get through. More filler characters than ones that help develop the story. 3. Whenever you hop up to a small ledge, you actually jump past it and fall to your death. I'd like to think Niko has a little better judgement than that. So overall, despite a few minor drawbacks, this is a very good game. The M rating is well deserved, but who doesn't like that?!",5,3,0,344,1356,20,452,24,5,81.13,5.5,5.31,8.06

"GTA IV is an amazing breakthrough in modern gaming! The environment of Liberty City has come to life! From the skyscrapers, to the vehicles, to the weapons, even the water flowing down the rivers have been graphically designed to perfection. The writers from the GTA franchise come through again! A whole new storyline brings a hard-edge and humorous adventure to the game! However, if you have an appreciation for extreme detail and customization in these games, it kind of takes a step backward from GTA SanAndres as far as customizing your cars and your personal style. Also there's no working out or learning new fight moves. But you can hide from the cops in the game which can be fun! I miss going to airports and flying planes like you could in SanAndreas. I think if they made a Grand Theft Auto: SanAndreas II for the modern consoles, and had all the features in the orginal plus the graphics of GTA 4, it would be the greatest game of all time!",5,2,0,173,764,20,251,10,9,66.53,8.28,8.46,11.54
"I wont beat around the bush: Grand Theft Auto IV is the greatest game to come out for the Xbox 360 so far. I say that without reservation. It is a true evolution for the critically and commercially successful GTA series, not just a next-gen polish job of the same old game. But maybe even more importantly, its a new high water mark for video-game storytelling in general. This may sound like hyperbole, but it is deserved: GTA IV signals a moment in video-game history where it can no longer be denied that the medium can be as significant of an entertainment vehicle as the best that movies or television have to offer.

"This is the first Xbox 360 game I have played. And I can't stop playing! It has got a great story line. And with my HDTV, the graphics are just amazing. However, sometimes the characters move kinda like robots. As far as the AI goes, I am not so satisfied, because sometimes even if you do something bad (minor ones) before the police, they won't come after you anyways. And yea, you don't have to stop for red lights even if there are cops around, lol. This game actually makes me want to buy a luxury car in the future, since you can clearly tell the enormous difference among various cars when you are 'driving' in the game.",5,2,0,121,487,10,163,8,6,77.52,6.2,5.91,9.36
"I just picked up the game and so far it is more or less living up to all of the hype it has been receiving. It has good graphics. Well they probably are not the best graphics I have seen, they are good. All of the little details that are included in the game are what make the visuals outstanding. An example is instead of just popping open the door of a parked car, Niko might bust in the window and have to hotwire the car. Ah, it's the little things in life that we cherish. Anyways, there have been many tweaks to the game since the last installment. The new cover and targeting mechanics work great and make the game a lot easier. There are no more ammunition shops; instead to make the game seem more realistic you buy guns out of car trunks. The cell phone is a nice addition and really adds a lot to the game. You can use it to call up NPCs you have met and access multiplayer. These are just a few of the great new additions to the game. (There are too many to name here.) The thing that I like about the multiplayer is the fact that you have free roam of the entire Liberty City. You can go anywhere; do anything, just like in the real game, except now you can have up to 15 other people in there with you. The chaos is endless. Bottom line is this is a GTA game and the best one yet.",5,2,0,259,1009,21,335,17,5,81.95,5.61,5.16,9.34

"Though this may not be the most in depth game that I have ever played, it is probably the best GTA that I have ever played. There are more than a couple reasons that I say this, but let's start with the bad... + 1.) The Vehicle Handling - The worst thing about this game in my opinion is how the vehicles are controlled. There are only a very select few cars that I am willing to cruise around in throughout the game because of the poor handling! That is probably just personal preference however. + 2.) Still working on finding this one! + Now, onto the good stuff... + 1.) Niko - The main character is so much better than that of the previous GTA 'heroes'. He doesn't have that, 'I'm CJ *****' attitude, he isn't completely silent, and he isn't convinced that he is the king of the world. Really laid back and only seldom does he spout off some pointless quip. + 2.) The Map - Though I was a big fan of Vice City's map, I have to say that thus far I am enjoying the new Liberty City more. This could just be because of the massive dissapointment they offered up in San Andreas (what a stinker!!!) + 3.) The Minimal, but sufficient customization - I want to start by saying that I am a character customization 'NUTZOID', but I found all the different systems that were offered in San Andreas to be neat, but for the most part dead-end wastes of time. GTA isn't really about being this custom character, it's about playing out the story that is in front of you, and besides, you can change up your clothing however you wish and you can still obtain certain properties! That is really good enough, in my opinion, for this game. + 4.) The missions - So far, what I have played, this game is pretty fun. It offers up some fun missions that aren't impossible, but that aren't just a walk in the park. It seems like the faster that you complete the mission the easier it is (once you have played a while you'll know what I'm talking about). + 5.) The Combat - There is a new and vastly improved hand-to-hand fighting system. This new system allows you to punch, kick, block and even disarm your opponent! Also, when wielding a weapon, you can blindfire around corners, and even use cover. + All of that just begins to cover the things that I have found better about this game than the previously released versions! Overall, this is a great game, I would suggest it to any gamer, especially fans of the GTA series!",5,1,0,451,1843,35,616,30,6,76.02,6.39,6.26,9.12
"I purchased this game a couple of months ago, played through it twice, and have only good things to say about it! The storyline is unlike any other storyline that I've seen in a game before. It's original, fun, and there are even some twists and turns that you'll come across throughout the game. There are MANY different characters that you'll meet throughout the story, and you'll even have a chance to kill some of them. Hehe. The gameplay is fantastic. The driving is realistic, though this can prove to be a pain in the rear sometimes. The voice acting is astounding; you'll find yourself so immersed in the game, that you'll start thinking that you're IN Liberty City, which also looks extroadinary. There are tons of mini-games, such as going bowling and playing darts. (Niko's also able to obtain girlfriends within the game; some of them have special perks which can benefit you as you play!) The variety of weapons, guns and melee weapons, isn't as broad as the previous 'Grand Theft Auto' titles, but this only makes the game more realistic. Of course, you still have the trusty ol' RPG that you can take down choppers with! Overall, I give this game a 5/5, not because I'm following a trend of 5/5's, but because the game DESERVES that rating. It was well worth the wait to purchase this game, and I must say, it was probably the best $60 I've ever spent.

"Great videogame. Compared to the other GTA's in the popular series of games; GTA 4 is the best so far, out of all of them.I've played each one, and this one has better cars, better weapons, and now you can use a cellphone to call other characters that you encounter throughout the game (i.e.girlfriends, mobsters, enemies, friends, ect.) Good storyline, fun adventures, and the further you go in the game; the more cool stuff you unlock (like better missions, better weapons, new girlfriends, new areas of the city and map open up.) There's too much great stuff to list, not to mention that with the XBOX 360 version, you can also play LIVE with your friends or other online players. The only con (which isn't much of a con) is that the in between movies that play after you complete a mission or go further in the story; tend to run a little long. But overall, it's a great game for mature teens 14+ or adults, due to the mature nature of the game, and M rating.",5,1,0,185,745,9,246,9,8,73.48,8.12,6.44,10.17
"I rarely get a game and constantly play it for hours. I try to time myself on my play time so I'm not stuck in the house al day. But this game gets me so involved with it I just don't want to put it down. I enjoy playing this character because even though he is STILL a cold blooded killer, he is the most liked out of all the GTA main characters that I have played. The vast open scenery is key cause I don't like playing a game when the backgroud fades away or just pops up like a block before it configures into a building or a mountian. Using the controller is also quite easy to used compared to the previous games. The driving though is too loose and you tend to swerve around alot (Especially when you are riding a motorcycle). All around this game is huge and deffinitaly entertaining.",5,1,0,157,626,11,212,8,8,72.68,8,6.14,10.65
"This is a great game, but it is not suitable for young kids, because of the intense violence and language. I recommend this to anyone who liked the previous GTA games, i personally rank this the best out of all of them. You are a man from Russia (i think), who comes to Liberty City to meet his cousin, Roman. Here in liberty city there are many missions that you can do for a variety of different people. There are many guns and cars in the game, and you can fly a helicopter around, but not a plane. The online is fun if you want to kill some people with some friends, and do drive bys. In general, GREAT GAME, FUN ONLINE. 5/5",5,1,0,124,486,12,167,8,5,77.17,6.35,5.34,10.07
"I was really excited when I first bought this game, but now, I pretty much just feel like I am driving around and really not doing anything. The missions are great, however, if you are chasing someone down, the car doesn't handle that great at all. I've spent a little over 20 hours and have only completed 11% of the game... So it definently is long and has great game play. Plus- there are lots of cheats out on the internet already to help with different cars, more guns, and the ability to change your wanted level. If you have a lot of time to sit down just to play GTA4 then by all means go ahead and do it, but after awhile, it gets really boring. I've also tried to get online to play, but have had a really hard time actually getting into a match.. There are still a few glitches that I can see that needs to be worked on.",4,1,0,166,643,14,220,8,8,73.65,8.14,5.55,11.67
"This game is great. One pro I want to tell you about is that if a vehicles door is locked, you bust the window out. There are only a few minor cons about this game. Okay lets start. If you plan on buying this game to immediatly drive in NYC, which I did, you may be disappointed. You have to complete a little over 23% of the game before you can drive in NYC. However, you CAN drive over there if you want, you just have to evade the 6 star wanted level, which you cant. The last con about this game is the toggle control. When you steer around corners in a vehicle, the corner is blind only for a moment, due to the toggle controls. Overall, this game deserves 5 stars. If you haven't bought it yet, GO NOW AND BUY IT!!! You will enjoy it. WAIT, one last minor con, the cops on the game will point their weapon at you when your close to them and try to place you under arrest until you bust out of in front of them, if you don't bust out from in front of them, your going to jail.",5,1,0,201,751,7,250,13,4,85.92,5.12,4.26,7.58
"I am not a fan of this series. That said, I can't stop playing. It is like being in a movie and you are the main charactor. I have never played a video game that had me so totally involved. I can't get enough. It is like I am really there. I have the xbox 360 version and I can hardly stop playing the game. The controls are simple. The graphics are a little too real. I especially like the way the game teaches you as you go along. This is all before I even tried the online version. Ok back to online. I paused this review to try the online and my first impression is also amazing there is no lag and the interaction with real player make the game even more real. I would recommend this game to anyone over 17 as it's content is truly adult. This is a must buy for any gamer other than kids. I only wish it was also out on PC as I prefer PC controls. Bottomline buy it if you can find it.",5,1,0,185,688,11,252,17,2,80.55,4.73,3.35,6.73
"So far, I've only played a couple of missions, but this game has great potential! I've played tons of games, and solved some, but this has so many side games and missions, it's staggering! The only bad thing I'd have to say is I have an 8 year old, and the casual cussing in the game is so often, I don't think I can even let my daughter HEAR the game! Not that I'd ever let her play it, but it's tough on dad's. Just a heads up!!",4,1,0,96,321,3,114,5,4,86.88,5.91,2.32,8.93

"I picked up GTA4 last night at the midnight release and had (between last night and this morning) about 3.5 hours to give it a try. Let me say, as a long time gamer, this is one of the best games I have played in a long long time. The story (so far) is rich and full of amusing characters. The control scheme is familiar (for those who have played the previous installments) and easy to pick up. The one issue I've had is the face that you have to watch the entire opening cinematic before you can jump in and play. I assume this is to give your console a chance to load the extremely expansive landscape that is Liberty City. The mission system is great, and all the missions seem to be unique in one way or another. They're not too hard, but they're not very easy either. Perfect for the casual sit down before work, or the long grind of a late night full of pizza and redbull. This game is DEFINATELY not for the young or easy offended. The language is real, and very graphic, the violence is brutal (including cop killing and other conterversial subjects), and there are continious references and instances of adult themed activities. If you are a parent, I would not reccomend this for your young children. BUT, if you are a gamer, or a fan of the serious, then you will be highly satisfied with the way the fourth installment of the series has turned out. If I could rate this between 1 and 10, I would give it a perfect 10.",5,1,0,275,1121,25,379,15,7,71.63,7.82,6.55,10.97
"If you are a fan of GTA, then I assume you already have this game. If you aren't familiar with the series (hard to believe but I'm sure there is a minority out there), you cannot go wrong with this title. In my opinion, if you only have one game you could by all year, this is the one. It is so entertaining to say the least, whether you go on a rampage, explore the city, or stay true to the story mode, there is not a second that passes without an interest in what you are doing with the game. I really hope more games use the Euphoria physics engine as it makes the movements of the characters so realistic.

"this is yet another GTA game comparable to past GTA games. the graphics are by far the best of the series and they did take a more realistic approach on driving, shooting than previous games. the game in my opinion was not worth the origional $60 price tag due to lack of diversions out side of the main mission unlike saints row. the game does support trophies which does add some replay value but there seems to be a few things lacking compared to the previous san andreas such as vehicle customization, working out to get bigger and stronger, the need to eat but not over eat. some of the features that made the last game stand out are missing which kind of takes away from the fun of it (working out was not fun, but getting bigger and dual wielding sawed off shot guns and making your car look different were neat aspects) they have dating in the game which is more of a pain than anything, dealing with all the personal relationships in the game to keep everyone happy. i personally found it annoying to have to stop game progress to take everyone out on a 'date' so they continue to like you and give you their help/bonuses in the game. all in all they went forward in the series while taking a few steps back, maybe the next GTA game will hit the nail on the head (or score a bullseye for those who play darts in the game). they added dart, pool, and bowling as a diversion, the games are not great but it is something to do outside of the missions and they have trophies associated with them as well. all in all a good game for the $40 right now",4,0,1,297,1233,22,395,9,15,60.82,12.97,7.71,16.16

First of all the story is very boring and has no appeal, I found myself skipping the cutscenes after I got tired of it. Also, the begining is a way to lose gamers, because all you do is drive people around you don't even get a gun! Plus, to run tapping A is very annoying. Next, controling the cars is bad enough its a pain. Another thing I don't understand is why people talk about the graphics the character models look horrible, the only good looking stuff would be the city. Finally the health system and missions are poorly done. The missions are boring and the finding stands to gain health are a pain to find. Sad to say GTA4 is just flat out bad, if you want an fun open world game check out the Saints Row series you will find more fun in those games.",1,4,5,187,721,9,244,10,7,77.47,7.1,5.29,9.41

It looked great from gameplay videos; however, after playing it on the Xbox One S, I was utterly disappointed by the performance issues this game suffers from--it doesn't run smoothly. It suffers from frame rate drops. The graphics for the Xbox One are blurry compared the the PC and PS4 (I was very upset when I learned this). The game looks ugly at times. All of these maladies take away from the enjoyment and playability from the game. I really hope patches will be released soon to remedy this, but until then, it's so irksome that it's unplayable, at least for me.",2,6,14,120,502,12,168,7,7,71,7.62,7.07,10.86

I enjoyed the hilarious story mode, which features Shaq as voiced by Shaquille ONeal himself. The story features tons of jokes, celebrity parody bosses, and quirky product placements that Shaq had advertised in the past. The only negatives I noticed were inconsistent hit detection and one dimensional defense. You can only roll up and down. Overall, I recommend this game to anyone interested in simple beat em up games. Shaq delivered non-stop humor throughout the game.",4,1,0,115,536,19,183,8,8,57.62,8.79,9.55,12.36

"I purchased the digital version of this software prior to reading the other reviews. I have only had one problem after another, and still don't have the software. I've called the Digital Library support line, been placed on hold, and transferred multiple times. A number of times I've waited over 30 minutes for a call back, only to be placed on hold again, then transferred to a disconnected line, and have to start the whole process over again. Geek Squad confirmed that there is NO issue on my side, that there is something wrong with their download link, but I can't find anyone that can help me. I will NEVER buy another digital download from Best Buy. You are better off downloading directly from Steam or another online service. At least it will be instant, and you don't have to wait for some stupid upload of the software to your Library, that you can't download. At this point I'm looking for a refund and will buy the software elsewhere.",1,16,1,176,754,14,246,9,9,68.74,8.53,7.88,11
"I purchased this digital version and having previous digital game experience, I thought this would be a simple download process and I would be playing in no time. Once the game showed up in my digital library, I clicked on the download button and absolutely nothing happened. I called Best Buy's support number and was transferred around several times. Finally Geek Squad tells me it would cost me $49-$99 in order for them to help me. The game its self was $65. Why should I have to potentially double the game for them to fix their own issues with downloading. I have a brand new top of the line Dell laptop so I doubt the issue is with my computers requirements. I spent a total of 55 minutes on the phone with several different people just to try to get a refund. Finally, some one says they will mail me a refund gift card and it will arrive in a little over a week. Awesome... so much good that does me. Terrible game support.",1,18,5,176,737,18,246,12,6,73.7,6.62,6.8,9.96

After 2-3 days of dropped transfers, speaking to people who didn't even know what the problem was, but had no trouble giving me a resolution anyway, and other dead ends (I could go on....) their solution was to redeem on the Steam platform, which works, but a huge headache and TERRIBLE customer service.",1,6,1,89,389,8,128,4,11,62.58,10.06,8.57,12.5
"Civilization 6 is a decent game. It brings some new mechanics that try to make the game more interesting. The success of that is questionable like the cities now having districts that also limit each city to focusing on only a few traits, mainly because of the lack of space for each city, or the culture tree that now runs as a clone of the science tree. The graphics have been dialed back as well, which is unacceptable. The game looks cartoony now and some of the designs for units are very unrealistic. I've played Civ 5 for over 300 hours and can say I prefer the 5th with a doubt. What Firaxis has shown from the 4 last games they have put out is that they do not fully understand what they're doing anymore. They randomly inject ideas into rushed games and it has shown. They sell well at first because they have a strong legacy but their games have not been up to par with their history. It would seem they spend too much playing their own games and not enough developing them.",3,4,0,187,786,16,256,10,8,72.04,7.86,7.33,10.9

It has all my favorite features from previous versions and some new improvements that take it from awesome to perfect.",5,4,0,83,375,12,122,5,9,65.63,8.23,8.98,12.42

"This seem like a much better Civ V. It may not seem like there's a lot of improvement, but they make a difference. The districts make planning your city much more important, as it takes up tiles and positioning can affect multiple cities. Gone is the global happiness, replaced by amenities and makes expansion easier as long as you can find new resources. The new civic tree is a nice addition and can provide a strategical boost when needed. I do wish they had more leaders to choose from, but I guess they're saving that for expansions. There are some UI bugs here and there but more of an annoyance than anything too troubling. Still I'm having a good time with it.",5,1,0,125,533,15,175,8,7,72.54,7.02,7.38,11.05

"This review is based on previous releases of this series title and what has changed. I am an Avid fan of the Forza series but this time around I am completely disappointed!!! The game is absolutely beautiful but I complaint is about the Ultimate edition. With the ultimate edition, you are supposed to get 4 day early access to the game, not just part of it and that is exactly what has happened. There are so many features that weren't enabled and after scouring the internet and finding answers in forums, Turn 10 (the company that makes Forza) said that all features will be available on October 3rd, the release of the standard edition. If I wanted to only play part of the game, I would have stuck with the demo and played that over and over. The extra money spent would have been better used elsewhere and not on an unfinished product. The next issue I have with the game is the VIP membership you get with buying the ultimate edition. Forza has nearly always made the VIP portion of the game advantageous for people who opted for it as opposed to those who didn't. Better XP for races, lifetime double credits, VIP exclusive cars, etc. This time around, they went back on their initial wording of their VIP program. So instead of what was said about the better xp and double credits, they changed it after the game was released and reworded it to 5 mods cards that give xp and double credits. There are other glitches in the game but that is to be expected as a first day release.",2,10,1,275,1186,31,406,13,10,60.46,10.08,8.16,12.97

"The game is still a great racing sim, however Microsoft, as done with Gears of War 4 and Halo 5, have chosen to cram disgusting micro transactions into a 60 dollar game. The version i bought was the 100 dollar game which is even worse. VIP launched gutted so people would have to buy crates, in an awful bait and switch move that has since been rectified, but single player career mode is slightly geared toward making players want to buy loot crates which is insulting. Its a good core game, if you can look past the other stuff.",3,5,0,99,422,7,136,4,12,65.5,10.27,8.07,12.73
"Unfortunately the VIP Pass you pay for in the Ultimate Edition is almost worthless. In past Forza games buying the VIP would give you some exclusive cars, and unlimited credit, and XP bonuses. Now they limit the XP and credit bonuses to cards. They give you a whole 25 uses on them which goes by really fast. As for the game itself, its amazing. So far its turned into my favorite racing title. I just recommend buying the regular edition and the car pass separate instead of wasting money on buying it in this.",4,5,0,94,408,16,146,7,6,61.81,7.97,7.52,12.18

"I have owned all seven Motorsport releases and three Horizon games, and this was my favorite for about two months. With a few exceptions (tree lines on Maple Valley), this game looks and feels incredible in 4K with HDR. Cars look and sound great, and it has the largest collection in recent Forza memory. After 75+ hours invested in the game, everything disappeared. My hundred or more cars are gone, my millions in in-game currency is gone, and my career progress and collectors status erased. The game all of a sudden lost all data and there's no known fix despite it being a known problem. I reached out to the Forza team for help, received a generic response that they'll look into it, and I'm sitting here waiting two weeks later. $100 for a great game that I now have no interest in touching.

Forza Sport 7 is on the cusp of trying to go the 'Pay to Win' formula that has been popularized by FIFA and now Call of Duty. Pay money to obtain crates to increase your credits:(. Decreased credits for wins. Now changed to 2X payout for VIP's with last game update. If they continue to go this route, I am done with this franchise! Pay to win is the reason I stopped playing FIFA and Madden. Look it up the net and you get more info on this terrible change sweeping video games.",4,1,0,121,478,6,161,10,4,81.99,4.83,4.98,6.82
"Forza 7 expands on some dynamics and tracks, it's still more of the same, but that it is not necessarily considered a bad thing, the same has been proven fun for quite some time. I like to play racing games with a steering wheel, with new dynamics comes new challenges. Out of the box, the game is not set for a good steering wheel feel, unless you want to feel like you're racing a heavy piece of farm machinery without power steering, but a few adjustments and it's good to go. The visuals are nice and add to the sense of realism, a better set up out of the box for steering wheel support would be nice. At least it has steering wheel support. I used to love the NFS games, but they only let you play with a thumb stick, not nearly as fun. I don't bother with NFS anymore.",4,1,0,155,604,9,199,7,8,75.74,8.2,5.78,11.18

Night and weather effects are jaw-dropping. - Physics feel very good with a controller. - Sounds great. Cons - Almost a month after release, parts of the game are still unavailable, example: Auction house, Forzathon, etc. Unacceptable. - Custom, searchable online lobbies would be nice. Resigned to fact that they are probably never coming back. - Computer AI is moronic. And the rubber-band nature of how they behave it ensures that if you do turn the difficulty up, they're still stupid, but really fast. - In single player, still no qualifying to be found.

"I am a Forza fan since the first game was released, in 2004 on the original Xbox. I own and played over 1,000 combined hours on all 6 Forza Motorsport and all 3 Forza Horizon editions previously released,. Today I added the 10th edition to my Forza collection with an ultimate edition copy of Forza Motorsport 7. FM7 is the best installment of the series. Impressive visuals and sound, solid controls on controller and wheel (I own a Logitech G920), master FFB and sim enough to be challenging and captivating. Yes, there are other simracers with more accurate to real life physics. However, FM7 physics are very close to a real sim, and production levels, presentation, graphics, game design are eons ahead of ANY other racing game on Xbox One. FM is an incredible experience with a controller and an epic one with a good FFB wheel (Logitech, Thrustmaster, Fanatec). There are also enough assists and settings to make this game accessible even to those who never played a racing game before. Last but not least the tunning and livery editors combined deliver an extra dimension that no other racing title on Xbox One gets even close to offer.

The graphics are absolutely beautiful and if you install the game to your Xbox 360 hard drive it improves the graphics even more and improves load times. The only problem with that is that this game has 3 discs so if you install all 3 it's going to take a big chunk of your memory space on your hard drive but if you have a 250gb like me it's no big deal. This fantastic game, and everything is designed great. From the guns, to the world in the game, all the way down to a little plant. you might pass by. Everything has a lot of detail.

"This game looks great even on my aging 42' LCD. I did have the occasional pop-in textures but that's a small price to pay when taking in the amazing wasteland crafted by id. The controls are tight and fluid. This game is simply fun to play, although I wish some of the gameplay options were fleshed out more. The real downfall of the game is the story. The initial setting is interesting enough, but there never seems to be much purpose to your actions. On top of that, the game ends rather quickly and the ending falls flat. The entire final level is extremely anticlimactic. As long as you go into Rage accepting that the story is flawed, and the real fun lies in the shootouts and driving sequences you will enjoy your time spent playing.",4,5,0,138,590,10,193,9,7,72.95,6.89,7.41,9.03

The vehicle parts, especially the racing, felt nothing more than an arcade offroad game and added no value to the game. There were audio problems. It seemed like the game was only 4.1 surround sound, not 5.1. The center channel didn't appear to be used at all, and dialog with characters came out of all speakers and was not directional. PC and console users alike reported this issue. It looked pretty good graphically although a bit cartoony for me. Note: I did not play any multiplayer.",3,2,8,122,521,13,180,12,4,71.7,5.78,6.4,8.33
"The game is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland created by an asteroid impact, based on the real life asteroid Apophis, which is on track to pass near Earth in 2036. In Rage's story, the asteroid strikes on August 23, 2038, and the few pockets of survivors are forced to begin a new civilization. The world is populated by human survivors of the impact, who have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own. Bandits and mutants serve as the player's main enemies for much of the game, although id Software has hinted at some sort of significant change around the halfway point in the storyline. The player emerges into this setting after being preserved inside an underground cryogenic pod called an Ark. The Arks are the direct result of the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks were sealed under the surface of the Earth with twelve people inside each. Each passenger possessed a special ability or trait that, combined with those of the other members, would help them rebuild society. The Eden Project, however, was far less successful than hoped. The player's Ark in particular is in bad shape at the start of the game. All of the other residents of the player's Ark are dead (presumably because of the impact), and the equipment of the Ark is destroyed as well, so the player wakes up alone and uninformed. With no memory of his identity or objective, the player is forced to head for the surface to find sustenance and allies",5,7,23,290,1359,43,457,12,13,48.99,12.43,10.53,15.6

"The Caligula Effect surprised me. When the game started asking me at the very beginning what my personal real life shortcomings are, I knew immediately that this game was going to be something special. Its a game that goes into the mind of us as people and what drives us to run away from our problems and escape to a fantasy world. For some it's video games, movies, anime, television shows, books or in this case music. The story takes place in a world called Mobius created by a Japanese POP idol named U. Through hearing Us many songs people start being sucked into this world that they never want to leave and cant. Think of it as escapism that you cant escape from. You start the game in a cutscene where everything looks normal and it looks like just a regular high school ceremony. Things arent like they seem though as a sort of glitch in the matrix starts happening, weird digitized images start showing up on peoples faces and you realize something isnt right. You escape and meet up with this fairy looking girl named Aria and someone who also is aware of Mobius named Shogo. You get acquainted and this is where you meet up with the Go-Home Club, a group of people who also see through this fake world and start to devise a plan to escape. Turns out a group of villains called the Ostinato Musicians hold control over different parts of the city and the main goal is to end the different musicians reign, take them down, and get closer to confronting U about returning home. What I love about this game is the main theme of escapism. Every character, having been pulled into this world has their own reasons for being in Mobius in the first place. Solitude, not wanting to grow into an adult, getting away from responsibilities, taking revenge on a rival, changing your looks in radical ways, or wanting the world to stay the same forever. You get to see why they escaped and there are times when they get challenged on whether or not its better to just stay. Musicians themselves control each area through their songs, using them to brainwash people to stay in Mobius. Throughout the game youll come across many of these people. A percentage count will be next to them and once this gets to a certain point theyll be corrupted and turn into what is called a digihead. Then youll have to fight them to return them to normal. These people you can then interact with and start what is called a trauma quest. Talking with them and becoming their friend will open them up to their trauma and youll have the ability to cure them. This can be done through including them in the party and equipping them with a certain piece of equipment, bringing them to a specific person, letting them level up while in the party, or clearing another persons problem that is directly related to them through the causality link. This causality link is a huge network of people connected to each other. You can use this to keep track of quests and where to find certain people. Through completing quests and curing them of their trauma, you get equipment and minimal stat upgrades. Once you cure someone they will no longer be able to turn into a digihead enemy. It makes the world feel alive because you could see some character NPCs that youve seen hours ago in completely different locations. Gameplay is a dungeon crawler with many floors, rooms and encounters through the many environments that youll traverse. Encounters happen when you are caught in the vision of an enemy and youll activate a transformation called the catharsis effect. This is used to fight off digiheads who are lost souls that have been consumed by the world. Other characters will soon also get this ability after certain events take place where their determination breaks out and they awaken. The battle system has each character using moves depending on the situation. You can buff, debuff, break a shield, dash across the battle area and launch enemies as well to perform combos. The way this is accomplished is through a timeline system where you can adjust at what time each character does their move in what order. Each character has up to 3 moves they can make and Its important to note that once you confirm a characters orders you cant go back and change them, so it's really important to set up your team properly in the right order and watch for the percentage chance at the top left. Each time you put in a battle command you get to see what the outcome will be if all hits are successful, this is crucial to determine what the enemy will do as well because some attacks only do best or activate against certain moves. It also gives you time to dash away or block future attacks. Blocking in particular can stun the enemy and timing is everything where the smallest difference in timing a block can mean taking a lot of damage or sustaining next to none. There is also a bar that fills up called the Risk meter that builds up through stacking attacks. It goes up from 1 to 6 and once it reaches 6 a risk break will start and the enemy will be susceptible to nothing but critical hits for a while. Some enemies in a dungeon, upon defeat will open up a soul remnant which are random pieces of equipment. It incentivises exploration through this as well with the mysteries of the world, these are random messages that give you skill points scattered in each dungeon. These skill points can be used to strengthen and get new attacks and support skills. Most areas will have hallways making moving around feel somewhat clunky at times, normally this would make battles very enclosed but the game does this clever thing of expanding the dungeon area by cutting out all of the walls around you when you enter a battle. It can get pretty nuts when you have 3 or 4 different battles between enemies going on in the same room. Each character has their own specific weapon they use and different styles. Certain characters like Ayane focus on stunning an enemy, Kotaro is all about quick powerful damage, and Mifue builds up Risk quickly. You can have one character break a shield and then proceed to air juggle them and hit them when their down. You could build up risk and cause a risk break and proceed to launch them and build damage with long range attacks. There are even counter moves as well as special moves you can do when a characters yellow colored stress meter is filled that all look very flashy, cool and well animated. It all flows as this makes for a pretty addictive and dynamic combat system where experimentation of the characters different weapons and abilities is really fun and keeps the game fresh. The game took me 36 hours to beat and I played the game on normal up until the 8 to 9 hour mark. I bumped it up to hard and I thought it gave a better overall challenge. Id recommend starting the game on hard and then seeing whether or not it's still too easy or hard depending on your skill level. One of the absolute best parts about this game however is the music. Each dungeon has their own instrumental theme and the moment you enter battle the song actually transitions to the vocal version seamlessly. Bosses even have a remixed version of the vocal theme that really just brings it all together. You can tell that they really cared about the soundtrack as this ranks up with some of my favorites in recent memory. Dungeons are fun to explore listening to these tunes and are a clever way of invoking the music that the people in the locations are being brainwashed by. At the end of each dungeon you have a confrontation with the musician, each boss is very different from each other making these situations interesting. Theres even times one of your party members will have something to relate to them to make learning and to make more understanding of where theyre coming from. Theyre all pretty entertaining villains and their designs further accentuates their insanity. In between dungeons, you can head to your base and when you see green symbols above a character that means you can hang out and learn more about them. All of these storylines have some great moments like Shogos attempts to go on dates,Trying to get Ayane to overcome her hatred for men, and Izuru experiencing the domestic life. These eventually lead to you gaining the ability to dive deeper. Which allows you to help your friends overcome their trauma that relates to why they escaped to Mobius in the first place. Be wary though as saying or doing the wrong thing can lead to you locking out that persons character quest forever unless you go back. In this new Overdose version of the game there is a optional second story where you can experience being a musician and you even get your own theme, It has a different ending and looks to be worth the second playthrough having not done it yet myself. Voices are all in japanese and from what performances are given from the sounds of it most all of the voice actors gave it their all in giving these characters life. Concerning environments, they arent the best looking, considering that these are all just real world locations being a little warped. There are some great looking locals such as the spa hotel and aquarium among many others. Theyre all very different from one another so there are bound to be some favorites. Graphically as you can tell is not good, the game has some very flat character faces and the whole game itself looks muddy and unpolished. It is no surprise though after hearing about Furyu, the developers of the games philosophy on making the best possible quality games on limited budgets. There were two times when the game crashed on me, both times happening in docked mode and fairly early on in the game. There were also some weird glitches that happened that werent game breaking but just strange and kind of funny. The Caligula Effect: Overdose has several rough edges, but a lot of heart. - Slentay",4,3,2,1769,7968,200,2584,79,11,60.53,10.38,9.36,13.48

And youll die often, starting over at the beginning, losing (almost) everything in your inventory. But as you go along, getting a little farther each time, youre also gaining some traits that are permanent, like health restoration potions you can use once, then twice and so on.

"Honestly, I never heard of this game at all nor even knew it existed. My friend gave me this game as a suggestion and I said 'what the heck, let's try it'. 3 weeks later, and I cannot stop playing it. It is the perfect combination of anger, frustration and rage quiting and at the same time relief and accomplishment. You are going to die. Period. That's the point of the game. I quote Cleveland from Family Guy 'You don't win, you just do a little better every time' and it's so true. When you die, you start over from the very beginning, BUT anything you unlock (weapons, mutations, etc) carries over to the new game and you get this urge to see how you can go 'this time' around. It's such a great side scrolling platformer with an interesting story arc. I highly recommend this to anyone's Switch Library.",5,1,0,156,626,17,216,11,5,75.3,6.28,5.71,10.03

"This is my first roguelike game, and I have a love/hate relationship with this style. I love the non-linear approach, but I hate the groundhog day scenario of starting over completely after dying. I think its extremely well done: graphics, sound, controls, the myriad weapons & abilities... its addictive! There is tons of effort in honing your skills, learning what works best, having success, BUT then you die again and start over with none of those effective weapons again. Grind through, maybe you get something else that works for a bit, maybe you struggle for 5 more playthroughs with no luck. At some point, it wears off and you just want to play something else. I couldnt wait to jump into a more traditional game after this diabolical torture experience! Maybe Ill come back to this down the road, but everytime I see the cartridge, I cringe at the brutality that awaits. But its a great game nonetheless, just not my favorite style.

"I have never watched anything to do with Conan at all. Thankfully, this game has next to nothing to do with it, so I'm not out of the loop too much. However, I've been a fan of survival based games sense Ark: Survival Evolved, 7 Days to Die, and depending on your interpretation of 'Survival Based Games', since the dawn of Minecraft. I love the open world, the struggle to find/make shelter, the salvaging of the world's resources, and the great unknown of survival games. I compare Conan: Exiles to Ark for a few reasons, but it is unfair to say it is exactly like Ark. They are similar, but that may just be due to the nature of well-made survival games (which 7 Days to Die was not). While they are both pre-made worlds (not procedurally generated), Ark's denizens are randomly spawned, and generated throughout the map, and will always respawn at random. With Conan, things are where they are, ALWAYS. If I find a band of cannibals (which is around every corner), they will be there on every other server you play on, and will respawn there, exactly where they were when you found them, always. That's not necessarily a bad thing, however. Ark's experience is much different than Conan's. While it appears Ark is all about struggling to survive and sprawling out over the entire map searching for and taming dinosaurs, while constantly improving your technology to reach crazy limits within the world itselt (all the way up to space age, by the way), Conan is far different. It focuses more on the medieval aspect, with heavy emphasis on that era. It has tons of different types of weapons, tools, armors, etc. and it plays FAR more like Minecraft than that of Ark. It's building is way easier and relaxed than Ark's (I built a very nice, ocean-front resort in a matter of about a day or two, as opposed to it probably taking me around a week or longer on Ark, and without all of the senseless dinosaur related deaths attempting to collect materials). Conan Exiles provides a very predictable experience. It is scary to venture out sometimes, mainly due to carry-weight and not being able to take back your entire haul to your house, but once you've explored a location, you pretty much know how it will ALWAYS be. This can be bad if you feel like you're an avid explorer looking for different experiences each time you enter an area. But, for those looking to build and create, this is AWESOME, because those iron ore rocks in my front yard will always be there, and those Pirates will ALWAYS be far enough away from me to not pose a threat while I'm out of their area. I've spent HUNDREDS of hours in Ark; online, offline, private server, friend's server, etc. I loved it, and that passion for Ark is what drove me to purchase and look forward to Conan: Exiles. I've put in dozens of hours into Conan, but none of it was with a friend or on an online server. While I intend to put several dozen more hours into this game on my private server, I feel as though I could double or triple the lifespan of this game with extra people to play with, after all, it seems more geared towards the rich building mechanics behind the game. You can conquer and enslave the humans in Conan Exiles, and have them work for you and take away the loneliness of your solo, ocean-front getaway. They can defend your home on PVP servers as well. There are gods that you can praise your loyalty too, and eventually someone giant, titanic avatars to smite the map with. While there is divinity in this game, there are also terrible monstrosities that inhabit the regions of Conan Exiles. Their diversity ranges from Turtle-Gorillas, Crocodiles, Giant Lizards, and Terror Birds, to a city of ferocious Apes, a castle of undead soldiers, and a snowy wasteland of wights and draugr. The map is also split into 3 difficulties; the bottom left to lower central area is the easiest; the middle of the map stretching all the way to the eastern side of the map is the middle difficulty; and the top region is the hardest. The harder the land is to survive, the rarer the resources, and the greater the loot. The character customization is also fair at best. While the characters and armors look very nice, the actual options for customization seem lacking and limiting, which is okay since you're usually dressed in some form of body cloaking garb. For those who spotted the 'nudity' rating on the game, you'll only get the top half of women revealed. If you were expected full nudity, buy a PC because that's where it is allowed (ESRB's decision). This is fine to me, as nearly ALL enemy humans are next to naked - not all of them, but most of them. Also, if you are a server host, or a host of your own offline server, there are countless options to customize the setting of each session or server. It gives you near total control of how your experience or the experience of those on your server will go. If you happen to turn on the option, which I initially had ticked on, there is the Purge mechanic. I had no idea what this was at first, and after a little digging, I decided it wasn't for me, so I switched it off. It is basically a meter that builds up on your server, and when it gets to 75% all the way up to 100%, there will be a random, colossal hoard(s) of monsters that spawn randomly on the map. Their sole purpose is to target player made bases, ranging from broom closet homes from a one log-in player, to giant player made kingdoms (including my relaxing ocean condo). They can wipe away entire player homes and villages, so the goal is to prevent that and fortify your defenses with strong walls, armed guards, and extra players outfitted with higher end equipment. I feel like I may turn it back on some day when I grow far stronger, but while I'm lone-wolfing this unforgiving land, I think I'll sleep better at night knowing I won't be receiving a forced eviction from my home. Another thing that is important to point out is that I've yet to explore more than probably 10 - 15% of the map, so you can imagine that it is very big. So, all you explorers who were disappointed when I said this game can be predictable, you've still got quite a lot of gameplay before you, and loads of fun to boot. I bought this game at the 20% discount offered by Best Buy's (now restricted only to current members) Gamer's Unlocked membership, so I can't exactly say if I'd recommend this game at full price. If you have been eyeballing this game for a while, or already love survival-based games, then I can say you won't be disappointed with this game if purchasing at full price (especially with friends). But, if you have no idea what this game is about, or the genre in general, I'd wait until the game goes on sale, say $30?",5,3,1,1262,5267,133,1801,49,12,59.96,11.29,7.59,14.52

Well, here it is. The game has decent graphics, but not what you would expect from the nexgen consoles. The world is extremely small and you are blocked at nearly every turn from getting outside of the main paths. The game plays more like a story rather than an actual game. Run here, run there, press this button sequence and then watch the cut scenes. Even the 'combat' left much to be desired. No action, sneak up on a demon and press a button sequence and voila! There is absolutely no replay value to this game because it will be the same every time you play it. Same story, same sequence of events, same roaming patterns of demons, and the same lackluster finale.",1,5,1,154,674,8,210,11,7,77.26,5.96,7.82,7.68

"I was worried when I first picked up this game because of awful reviews given on gaming websites. However, I'm a fan of ghost stories AND detective games, so I had to give it a shot when I was able to pick it up for around $30. The first thing that struck me was the atmosphere. The art style is very well designed and portrays two separate worlds, the real world and the ghost world, very well on one screen at the same time. The voice acting for the main characters is incredibly well done, although some of the random characters walking around are average. The sound in this game is surprisingly important, as often times you'll hear enemies shriek long before you ever realize they're there. The collectables are a lot of fun to hunt down and find, with many of them providing extra Ghost stories that are narrated over a still picture. They are wonderfully done, and add a lot to the world of the game. The investigations are fun, if not terribly deep, and you never really fail an investigation so you don't have to worry about starting over. The 'combat' is... a little wonky, and really is best viewed if you try it more as a puzzle than an action game. It's designed to try and sneak up on your enemies, since there's no way to directly confront them. The story is everything I hoped I'd get from a good ghost story, and is why I have enjoyed playing this game so much. The main character is #surprisingly# incredibly likable, finding information about the killer is intriguing, and the side ghost stories can be especially fun. However, a fair warning: If you're considering buying this for your young teen or child, please consider that this game is rated M for Mature for a good reason. There are acts that are described in the game or shown in cutscenes that, while not gory, can be downright disturbing, and sometimes involve children. The game isn't perfect though, and suffers from a few technical faults. The game hiccups at weird, random locations sometimes, and can make it feel a little sluggish. Other times, you'll get spotted when you think you're clearly behind a wall, only to find out you had a tiny spot of you sticking through but didn't notice because of the camera angle. Minor details for a story game, but makes it seem not as polished as it could of been. Overall, if you like games for the story, or you like a good ghost story. If you're unsure, I would highly recommend this game once it drops in price a little bit or goes on sale. Definitely have enjoyed ever minute of the game.

"This is my first souls game... In fact I recently just got back into gaming altogether. I was trying to get some fun games to play as a returning gamer. This one looked intriguing. So I picked up a copy and have barely touched the other half dozen or so games I bought. The other games, all great titles, and honestly lots of fun, spend most of their time gathering dust while I attempt to grind through this beast. I want to play other games, I just can't put this down. It is freaking me out. The game is beautiful and captivating from the get-go. It is designed incredibly. The level of detail and thought put into the world and systems is impressive. The combat mechanics are amazing. The music is beautiful. But wow, it can definitely be difficult, at least for me as a new player. I was not prepared for the 'prepare to die' tagline to be such an understatement. But it is totally worth playing, and it IS fair, even though sometimes it does not feel that way. At this point, I almost always know exactly why I died, what I did wrong (which can sometimes be one misstep), and what I need to try to get through the next time. I will say that the feeling of accomplishment you get when taking down a boss, or successfully getting through a tough area, is incredible. The developers and the game itself do no hand-holding. Online message boards and videos have been necessary for me at many parts, not just with difficult spots or bosses, but with the lore and character development. There is a whole 'souls' world out there, and the community is really great for the most part. Dark Souls will haunt you. It requires so much from you... patience, strategy, critical thinking, creativity, your constant attention... but the payoffs are huge. If you want a challenge, and a game that is as much a blast as it is beautiful and deadly, pick a copy up.

It is a bit challenging, but it's not too bad. Do the training missions before starting your solo play and you'll have the basics down for getting around, which is pretty much all you need when you start. If you avoid combat like the plague to begin with, you should survive long enough to make some money. The game does lack a narrative or story fir the most part, but if you're a choose-your-own-adventure type, you won't really miss it. You have the freedom to do what you want, and when you want. Lastly, the scenery and exploration are top notch. If you love space, that should be enough to sell you. Give it a chance and play something different from your typical linear FPS.

"I am back to gaming after a 10+ year absence now that my 9 year old got an Xbox for Christmas. In terms of game play, the Madden game is very similar to the Madden game from a decade ago although the internet has created some problems. We bought the disk rather than download the game but when installing the disk, it still took 6+ hours to download the game. Every time we open the game, it asks to download updated rosters. We honestly don't need real time roster updates throughout the season. There are zero instructions with the game and if there are tutorials within the game, we haven't found them yet. We haven't even downloaded the FIFA soccer game yet. The best way to do that is to start the download before going to bed because the download takes all night. I'm just used to putting in the disk and playing right away. We haven't tried any online head to head games yet. Again, no instructions or guidance on how to do that either although I've figured out that we needed to buy an Xbox gold subscription, which I did, but I still don't know what to do with it.

"I've played through the first dead island (I'd reccomend that to anyone who wants to play this game) which I actually enjoyed. The game picks up where the first one left off where you left the island of Banoi with the same characters that escaped on the helicopter. One of the main differences with this game is the ability to do a diving attack on an emeny that is standing below you (very useful skill), also doing missions for the other surviving members from the first game is also an option. In the event if you don't feel the need to max out your stats (or what you can) on the skill tree you can work on things like shooting, two handed combat and I believe the third was defensive skills/survival. The game does have it's issues, for example when the characters talk, their lips don't quite match up as well as some of the close up cutscenes seem block like or a game that was made in the early stages of the ps3. Other than that it's a very solid game to follow up the first one, and the ending clearly leads up to a third dead island. I'm not a big fan of the star system, but 4/5 stars seems like a good rating (7/10).",4,2,0,227,882,14,294,7,14,64.35,12.34,6.13,15.44
"I didn't get the chance to play the first game so I won't be able to compare the two or say about the improvements since the first. The story was mediocre and some of the NPCs were kinda annoying and have no personality, so there was no reason to care for them at all. The loots were great and kept me coming back to look for more but it was very frustrating when your items disappear from time to time. I didn't like the checkpoint save system cause it's an RPG you should be able to save whenever you want and whenever you quit then come back to play again you'll be respawned at the place where you took the main quest, very annoying. I liked the coop system, it was smooth and fun playing with friends and strangers. The game was kinda easy with no real challenge at all and every time you die you'll respawn at a near location and the only penalty is cash, and the exploits in the continuous quests made the game really easy also since you can buy it. Bosses were too easy in Dead Zones you can just throw molotovs/grenade or shoot them at a distance and they won't attack you. The AIs were useless during defending points and you'll have to do all the heavy lifting 90% at a time. The main point of this game is killing zombies and they achieved it. I enjoyed the game but there was some bugs and some glitches along the way that hinders the experience but overall it was a great game. 7.8/10",3,2,0,279,1105,21,369,12,9,71.35,9.08,6.22,12.31

Still, I bought this game because I enjoyed the first one so much that I didn't think I'd mind playing it again. What I hadn't counted on is that all of the first game's weaknesses make this one just plain tedious. The writing - especially in the cutscenes and at the beginning of missions - serves no purpose other than to set up the missions, which half the time is moving stuff around. You'll give it a try, and then stop caring. Play this if you're working your way through the survival genre so you can scratch it off your list.

"This game is fantastic. Just great gameplay, especially the combat, super addictive. The Uruk Hierarchy system is really neat as well, getting to know each orc that you hunt adds a lot of satisfaction to the slaying of them, especially when that orc has been labeled your 'Nemesis' as a result of multiple stand-offs. The story is somewhat interesting, but you'll find your self ignoring it much of the time. The game is really short if you just play through the story, and the ending is so abrupt that it's painful, and there really isn't a final boss at all, just the hammering of a single button for ten seconds, then a cutscene, then the game is over. Ka-pow. The game is great though despite those things, and I highly recommend it, BUT I do NOT recommend you play this game on PS3 or Xbox 360. If you do, just know in advance that the game will be glitchy, glitchy, glitchy. Not all the time, mind you, but certainly glitchy enough to get in the way of your having fun. It might take 20 seconds to load the pause screen at times, the cutscenes before 'Uruk Duels' look like your old VeggieTales VHSs on fast-forward and sometimes the game will just run painfully slow and the sound will cut in and out, as if you were trying to play Titanfall on Windows 98. They just didn't put much work into the 'Last-Gen' ports at all, it seems. Maybe it'll get patched, I don't know (Really, I have no idea if patches could fix it or not. Not a techy at all.), but if I were you I wouldn't bother getting it on PS3 or Xbox 360, if you're planning to upgrade soon.",4,1,0,304,1208,26,405,14,9,72.09,8.6,6.2,12.11

"I was excited for this title, considering how unique the concept was: dungeon crawling, looting, dictating a market around the loot you found and selling said loot. However, I found both systems - the combat and the shop - to be shallow and repetitive. I wasn't expecting anything particularly deep in either category, but dungeoneering is barebones and simplistic, with repeating enemies and weak bosses. Selling your loot, the standout feature of the game, becomes a tedious chore as there is no outstanding punishment for pricing your goods too high or low. You simply adjust the prices until you find a sweet spot, rinse wash repeat. Again, I wasn't expecting overly complex systems, but the shallowness was too grindy and mundane to keep me interested.",2,1,0,125,611,21,204,6,13,47.62,11.79,11.52,15.05

"The Good: Deus Ex Mankind Divided is a very good game that has excellent storytelling and characters. The gameplay is relatively smooth, except for the occasional drop in framerates when running around the multiple locations. I feel the levels are well designed and give the player a multitude of options when completing objectives. I found myself constantly exploring and more often than not being rewarded for that curiosity. The Catch: The story ends very abruptly. It feels as if the story was intentionally left open to later be addressed in DLCs. My advice to game companies would be to release complete stories in the core game and introduce 'NEW' stories in DLC. I hate being left on the hook with plot-lines on TV Shows and movies and I hate it even more in $60 video games.",4,7,0,137,633,22,216,8,9,56.07,9.69,9.64,13.27
"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided represents what I feel is sometimes a lost art in games today: A compelling story, an immersive world, and a sense of ownership over who you play as. DX:MD stays true to the franchise. If you like the semi-open world, multiple path approach to the previous DX titles, you won't be disappointed. The game has something for everyone whether you prefer combat and weapons upgrades, or stealth and world exploration. That said, like other similar titles, you need to be willing to invest into the game. If you don't have a ton of patience, or just want a pick-up-and play experience (while the game does offer an arcade mode for this), you might find this title is not for you. It certainly is a game for the hardcore gamer. The only knock against it is that some of the animations and voice acting can be rough around the edges at times, but is easily forgivable as you get to explore what is quite a thought-provoking story and believeable environment.",4,2,0,180,774,21,262,8,11,60.86,10.36,8.17,13.67
"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is the fourth main installment ('main' meaning I'm not including the mobile spinoffs) in the Deus Ex video game series. Your enjoyment of this game will probably depend largely on your enjoyment of the prior games in the series, specifically Deus Ex: Human Revolution from 2011, given that DXMD is a direct sequel to DXHR, taking place a mere two years after the events of DXHR. Much like its predecessor, DXMD has you in the role of Adam Jensen, a human who has, without his consent, been upgraded with experimental mechanical augmentations. Following the fallout of DXHR, mechanically augmented humans are being cast out of society and discriminated against by natural humans. Adam's goal is to expose the conspiracy of the Illuminati, who have orchestrated the events of DXHR and DXMD from the shadows. To accomplish this, Adam has access to a wide variety of augmentations that allow you to modify your play style. You can choose to upgrade your weapon proficiency and defensive capabilities if you're looking to play the game as a first person shooter and go head on with enemy combatants. You can choose to upgrade your hacking abilities to change the environments in your favor and against the enemies. You can choose to upgrade your stealth capabilities to completely disappear from sight and never engage your enemies at all. You can also mix and match any of the above to discover your own preferred play-style. The keyword there was obviously 'choice.' That's what the DX games have always been, or at least tried to be, about. DXMD is a worthy follow-up to DXHR and would easily recommend it to a fan of the DX series. Non-fans may want to watch some videos of various playstyles to get a feel for whether or not they'll enjoy it.",5,2,0,312,1422,45,488,14,12,51.89,11.56,9.67,14.68

"This game was one that I had heard many good things about so I decided to give it a try. One thing that I am not a fan of is first person shooter games. This game is a pseudo-hybrid as it has elements of first-person and also third-person views. I mention this because I might have stayed away if I knew it was going to be first-person shooter-ish. That being said, the game is very good. The graphics are good, the game play is challenging and there are a variety of ways to complete many of the missions. The power ups for weapons are pretty decent too. The game reminds me of a cross between Metal Gear and Bioshock. The negatives are few but must be mentioned. The voice acting is ok for the most part but the lead character is very bland and since he has so much to say it can get annoying listening to him speak. I also noticed some issues with the sound track cutting out during some scenes with dialog. Also the sound track was pretty uninteresting so don't look for anything special here. Many have said the story wasn't as good as the previous game was. I think the story is good as far as stories go for video games. There are branching paths as well so your experience may vary from someone else. Since I haven't played the last game I can't offer a comparison but I can say that this story has some meat to it. All in all this is a great game with some replay value as you may want to try playing through a different way for a different outcome. I think the game will take roughly 15-20 hours to complete depending on you level of experience with these types of games.",4,1,0,313,1249,19,416,18,7,76.75,6.87,5.96,9.38
"I was very excited for this game to come out after playing the first one in the series, Human Revolution, a few years back on PS3. This one did not disappoint with the feeling of being able to go through the game however I felt like it (stealth, action, dialogue) in order to complete each part of the game. My only real complaint is that the story of the game. It felt rushed with many holes that I do not feel are answered as you complete the game. The side missions are great, and are very in depth for being so few of them. Also the only real boss fight you can encounter is the final piece of the game, and when it gets to that high, the game ends, which was a bummer, but the ride there was amazing,",4,1,0,140,549,7,181,6,9,73.78,8.77,5.99,11.33

"Never played the first Dead Island but I've had this one on preorder since last year when the steelbook cases were in stores. Always been a fan of the zombie genre and I figured this was a great place to start with the games. Anyone picking up this game and not the first will feel a little lost at the beginning but the story is good enough to stick on its own and not leave you scratching your head. Some of the quests can be a little repetitive at times, but once you get to the point where you have guns; everything is right in the world. Nothing quite beats that feeling when you put a sniper into the face of a boss mob and blow it's head off in a single earth-shattering blast. It's even better when a single shot takes out a group of zombies. Grenades are great as long as you don't blow yourself up, too. Riptide looks amazing as well. I felt the graphics were on par with Halo 4 and other titles. Didn't mind standing on the top of a building or tree house and just looking at everything around. Slightly long loading times were a tad annoying. And my only complaint is the multiplayer system. Both players should have to confirm that they want to join together rather than one person just deciding to join someone at random. Would find myself in a party without even knowing it. Also, when someone joins a party, almost all of the zombies in the area respawn which can nearly get you nuked if they're right on top of you. I spent 42 hours on the first playthrough and only got 71% completion. Going to have to go back as the other characters and try for the rest. So many sidequests and stuff to do!",5,1,0,314,1273,18,412,18,7,78.13,6.7,6.34,9.27
"If you liked the original Dead Island, you will like Riptide. Just like the original, it is not perfect. Even though it seems smoother than its predecessor, It suffers occasional lag and is not as refined graphically, or control wise as Borderlands, Bioshock, and other AAA releases. The missions can be a bit repetitive, and the side missions are mostly what the magazines refer to as 'fetch quests.' In spite of its obvious flaws though, Riptide is a B-Movie, zombie slaying blast. Creating weapons, upgrading them, leveling your character and choosing which skills to level up is incredibly addicting. The fact that its $10 less then a typical new release is just bonus. BB giving the $20 RZ certificate with preorder is an even bigger bonus! Fun game. If you liked the original, continue the fun with Riptide!",4,2,1,139,649,23,218,10,8,60.04,8.34,9.52,12.18
"This game has its moments, but in the end I enjoyed the first much more. But killing zombies always makes for a fun time.

You do not have a choice at what level you want to play the game, so you better know what you are doing. The plus side of it you get to go up to level 70 where it was level 60 in Dead Island.

"this game is getting a lot of hate online from contra fans. i been playing contra since the original so i like to think i'm more than qualified to judge contra games. first lets get one thing out of the way, the graphics. this has been the main point of contention among fans of contra. yes, the graphics kinda suck. this game looks like an early ps2 game. Neo Contra looks a lot better than this game. if you're going to pass on this game based on poor graphics alone, you're doing yourself and this franchise a disservice. if you can get pass the 'bad' graphics, which imo isn't THAT bad, the game is very fun to play. after all, contra is all about the gameplay, not how pretty it looks. i been playing this game for hours and i have been enjoying it so far. the only thing i don't like is that your weapons will overheat so you need to be careful not to overuse your weapons. there are upgrades you can buy to reduce the cool down time. imo, contra is a game about Run and Gun and i don't know why your weapons need to overheat. besides this, the gameplay is very fun. it's good for people who want a quick pick up and game type game. it won't waste your time and you will get right into the action, which i prefer. story is weak but c'mon, this is contra, in contra games, story takes a backseat to the gameplay. this game plays very similar to Neo Contra. you control your character w/the left stick and aim with the right stick. this type of game is commoning called 'twin stick shooters,' similar to games like Smash TV or Robotron. another thing i like to mention is the awesome case art. i love the cover art for this game. not too bad for Konami. on the reverse side of the cover is another great art work. most other switch games would be blank but konami decided to put great art work on every inch of real estate. cool stuff. great for collecting. is this the best contra game? no. imo if you want great contra games go play the original contra games on the NES, play Alien Wars on the SNES, then go play Shattered Soldier and Neo Contra on the ps2. is this game worth $40, imo yes. my shoes that i'm wearing right now that i bought from payless shoes cost more than this game. $40 isn't much. go buy this game! it's fun, nevermind the ps2 graphics, the gameplay is fun. if you want konami to make more contra games then buy this game.",4,8,2,464,1824,28,597,37,4,85.26,4.48,4.95,7.43
"As a Contra fan, I was excited about playing it in Nintendo Switch. Game is great if you focus only on shooting, improving your character, and reviving your childhood memories. However, graphics are not that good as expected for a 2019 video game technology. If you don't care about graphics quality, game is awesome.",4,4,1,55,254,12,91,4,8,52.9,9.3,9.2,14.23
"Yes this game does have inferior graphics regardless of what platform and somewhat resembles a mobil game. And no it is not a side scrolling run and gun like we all know and love of the Contra franchise. But all of that aside, the cut scenes and story is unique with continuity to Alien Wars, the characters are interesting and the gameplay is actually fun. I will admit the platforming in the game is a little problematic at times but not broken. If you see and play the game for what it is without preconceived visions of what this Contra game SHOULD be in your minds and keep an open mind I think this is a great video game. Give it a try if it goes on sale below the retail price of $39,99 Or better yet download the demo on your respective platforms and try it out first like I did.

"The Contra games have been among my very favorites since the 1987 original. I knew that Rogue Corps looked very different from most of the previous games in the series, but being Contra, I still crossed my fingers and hoped for an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, even after playing for a couple of hours, it's hard to get past 1) how slow the action seems to be, and 2) how frankly ugly the whole affair looks. The graphics don't even look HD. They're like something out of the PS2 era. The game starts promisingly with a comic book-style opening cinematic that looks great and is entertainingly presented, but it all goes downhill from there. The biggest hinderance to the gameplay is that your weapons have cooldowns, which is an entirely new and equally unwelcome addition to the series. Contra is about fast and ferocious running and gunning, and you shouldn't have to pause so your gun can cool down while you're being swarmed by enemies, especially when your secondary weapon overheats just as quickly. There are a number of character and weapon mods that can be purchased which will presumably lessen the pain of this misguided creative decision, but the modding system is almost impenetrably incomprehensible. At its very core, Rogue Corps can offer some brief bursts of action enjoyment. But it doesn't take long before you find yourself just wanting to play something else. A disappointing misstep for an iconic action series. At least it wasn't released for the standard full MSRP of most new games.",2,1,0,264,1226,33,404,13,11,56.76,10.39,10.05,13.12

"It's nice to see the Contra name back, but this is not going to please everybody. The game is a top down shooter with a lot of mechanics. It is not run and gun, there is a lot of customization and there are different characters who have very different styles.

"As an old school Contra fan, I was excited to hear that a reboot was coming. However after playing the game, I wondered why it took so long. First off the frame rate seems to be off, when there is heavy action onscreen there appears to be slow down and clipping on the characters. Second the upgrade system is a bit confusing, although I've just gotten to where I can expand on some skills, but there's so many options it's easy to get lost. Other than that I love the gameplay, simple run and gun that can be played couch coop or online. Can't speak to the online portion as I've yet to try.

The combat in 3 still holds up ( real reason to check this collection out). The other 2 are okay but you're not missing out much if you don't play them",4,0,1,97,372,10,133,6,5,74.43,6.89,4.92,10.59

"This was an extremely entertaining sniping game. First, does this game have some issues, yes, but is it also fun to play and accomplished what it was trying to do, absolutely! The core mechanics and gameplay are fantastic, especially when it comes to the sound and feel of the gunplay. The graphics and resolution are solid, and the open world adds something extra that the original two games did not have! It does suffer from frame rate issues at times and there are loading screens that most modern games have found their way around, but nothing that stops me from saying this game produced a wonderful experience. If you like 1st person shooters or sniper games, you will absolutely want to pick this one up! If money is tight, wait for a sale or maybe rent it, but in my opinion most will enjoy playing this 1st person, sniper, open-world game.",4,2,1,152,678,14,216,7,11,64.57,9.65,9.06,12.37

When I was buying this TV it was between to the Samsung 8000 series and the Sony my son has The 8000 series both TVs are excellent ,but I think I like the color on the Sony better and the 8000 had a 1400 nit brightness and it's like you're getting a sunburn but that's probably just his settings .

"Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn review (2018, T) I had heard of this game, and I was intrigued, but not enough to pony-up the cash for it. I was familiar with the infamous reputation of its 16-bit predecessor, but I had never personally had the displeasure. When this sale-dropped to $5, I figured it was worth at least that much. Honestly, I found the game to be rather ok, but maybe thats because my expectations and monetary investment were so low. The game is not a fighter like the original, but a mediocre arcade-style beat-em-up. Shaq just beats on the dozens of cookie-cutter enemies that flood the screen. Strategy or technique are not necessary; its pure button-mashing simplicity, and I can oddly respect that. Its as monotonous as one would expect, but not to the point where I was annoyed at it, but it did get close at times. There are health and energy orbs aplenty, as well as power-ups that make you and even bigger curb-stomper than before, so there really isnt a reason to ever die or even get close to death. Its not even that long; a 100% playthrough with all achievements plus the DLC should take less than a few hours. The graphics and art style are simple and cel-shaded, nothing special or memorable. The story, setting, and characters is where this games meager enjoyment get the most mileage, at least for me. I can understand why lots of people would find this games humor sophomoric and even stereotypically offensive, but I am an immature man-child so it worked for me. As you should expect from Shaq, the product placement is belligerent and numerous. I chuckled at the absurdity and shamelessness of the actual real-world products being used and referenced. The extras text and game dialogue did have a lot of funny, tongue-in-cheek moments that I felt worked for what they were trying to do. The plot is practically non-existent, but funny enough. An orphaned Shaq grows up as any normal Chinese master of kung-fu would, and now he must save the world from evil demons disguised as thinly-veiled parodied celebrities. So if you ever wanted to deck the lights out of expies of the likes of Justin Bieber or Donald Trump, youll at least get a kick out of that. The physical disc-only DLC swaps Shaq out for (no joke) Barack Dirty Barry Obama, who takes up the quest to finish off Kanye West. Its like a mad-lib found inside a fortune cookie. All in all, its by no means a great or even a good game. Its barely passable, and certainly not a notch in the belt of crowdfunded games. But what I can say is this: I paid only $5 for it, and I felt I at least got my moneys worth out of it. Any more than that, and this is just another miss like all those free-throws.",3,6,0,507,2115,50,714,25,9,67.11,8.94,7.27,12.06

I'm fairly sure my daughter will like it based on the videos I've seen. It's a unique concept...",5,0,1,77,300,6,102,7,3,83.6,4.33,4.42,7.52

There is no need to explore the USA because all races are accessible in menu. This is a little disappointing. The races are hard but fun. Frustrating when you can be 6 seconds ahead of the pack at one check point and get passed at the next check point. The mechanic of changing from car to plane or boat is cool and graphics are better, but crew2 uses the same map as crew1.

I really enjoyed the first Crew game so maybe my expectations were too high. This game fails on every level. In regards to game play, the physics are a disaster. I don't care about graphics if the game is fun. This game is far from fun and the graphics are not on par with modern games. Although the graphics are better than the first Crew game, at least that game was fun. Everything about The Crew 2 is lifeless. I can find something positive in almost all games I play but there is nothing positive I can say about The Crew 2.

"This is a great addition to the Street Fighter collection. What's nice about it is it stays true to Street Fighter roots while adding some pretty interesting additions. I like that SF has stayed along the classic 2D style of gameplay, it's always been preferred for me over 3D fighting games. However, they did add some 3D elements that are mostly animations that add some cool visual effect to the game. The directional pad can be frustrating to use until you adapt to it, depending on your experience with the Xbox 360 controller and fighting games. Using characters that require charging back or down for 2 seconds for special moves can prove difficult depending on your skill level. The new focus special moves and super special moves (can't remember what they're called) are cool editions, but if you're playing someone who is well accustomed to using them and you aren't, you're done for. If you like to play against the computer, and you play on the hardest level be prepared to be dominated by combinations of super attacks and focus attacks. It is labeled 'Hardest' for a reason though, so no complaints here. The only problem I have with the game is the Xbox Live portion, which was actually the portion I was most excited about. Finding a match against someone with a good connection can be a pain, and sometimes the lag is so bad it will take a full second for the game to render a command. Also, when you search for potential opponents, the game brings up three choices, and all three of those people might be in a game already. Why format the search this way? There should have been a search filter that searched for the optimal connection speeds and only displayed those hosts that weren't already engaged in a game with someone else. I've spent up to five minutes just searching for someone to play with on Xbox Live...very frustrating. If you have a friend who also owns the game, it is relatively easy to connect to that friend via an Invite to Game request. Despite the multiplayer downfalls, the game is extremely fun if you're a fan of the series. I think some of the new characters are kind of dumb, and I'll never play as them, but they're still fun to play against. If you're a fan of Street Fighter, you'll be a fan of SFIV.",4,3,0,419,1789,38,583,20,10,67.86,9,7.89,12.01
"This is an amazing game. I picked it up for $30 at bestbuy and could barely put it down. The difficulty settings can be switched around so you can make it as hard as you want, the controls are just as simple as they have always been and they didn't make the mistake that other fighting games like Mortal Kombat have done by making the environment 3-D. This is a game that you can play over and over with friends and the best part about it is that you don't need a fistful of quarters to play it anymore.",5,2,0,102,396,4,133,4,10,70.64,9.74,5.87,11.77
"Street Fighter 4 marks the 20th anniversary of the franchise and does it in a big way. The game includes the traditional Arcade mode where you fight your way through 7-8 stages unlocking the story for each character. Difficulty ranges from Easiest which is ideal for players new to the franchise or fighting games to Hardest for veteran players who need a challenge. A big part of Street Fighter 4 is the Versus mode which includes local if you have friends over and Online if you feel like challenging someone around the world either for fun or a ranked match. Challenge mode makes an appearance offering three different modes time attack, survival, and trial. Trial is unique because it will show new players how to play the game by making you perform all the moves of a character of your choice in order to proceed. Later levels of trial will teach you how to string combos together. Gameplay consists of three different punches (L,M,H) and three different kicks (L,M,H). By imputing different directs and pressing the correct punch or kick you can perform special moves as well as finishers. Moves execute flawlessly without any lag. All 25 of the characters available are evenly balanced so you never feel like you are at a disadvantage if you choose one character over another. The only problem with the gameplay is the Xbox 360 controller itself. The D-pad is very unresponsive when doing some moves so using the analog stick will be something you may have to get used to. Street Fighter 4 is a very easy game to pick up. However, if you are just starting to play you should stay away from the online until you have a general understanding of the moves and can perform them when needed. That doesn't mean that if you are new to the game that you should never play online. Street Fighter 4 takes a minute to pick up but a long time to master. Collectibles are what will keep you wanting to play more and more. There hundreds of Icons and titles to unlock by playing vs mode as well as different colors for each character, personal taunts for each character, concept art and anime movies from each characters story. Overall, I was very satisfied with my purchase. I had never played a Street Fighter in my life but this game makes it possible for someone new to be able to compete with the veteran players because of how simple the fighting system is to pick up yet it holds so much depth. Both 'casual' and 'hardcore' gamers can enjoy this game. If you are looking for a good fighting game; look no further. If you are looking for a good game to play with friends; look no further. If you are looking for a game that will entertain you for a long time; look no further.

"Ignore the first review, its useless and not accurate at 'ALL'. Sorry but thats my opinion. This game is NOOB friendly on controls and most moves come out smoother than most of the previous SF incarnations. The cartoon graphics are cool IMO and I love the revenge & focus features. My only complaint about this game is no tournament mode. I hope they add it as DLC later or in the sequel. Also I think they should find a way to incorporate spectator mode with tournament ala Gears of War when you're watching a team-mate play once you've died/eliminated from tourney. Just a suggestion.",5,1,0,107,467,10,153,8,6,72.29,6.5,7.65,9.09
"One of these reviews is obviously a troll. This game was not made to coicide with the movie. The movie was made to concide with the game. This gameplay brings back the concepts from Street Fighter 2 with a dash of Street Fighter 3. The moves have not changed for the iconic characters. The game is gorgeous and fluid. It runs at 60FPS. This game will probaley bring back the fighters for a new age of online competetion. Jump into the fighting circuit if your new or if your an old timer come in and start to learn a new system.",5,1,0,101,419,8,135,9,4,82.37,4.56,5.96,7.66

When I heard this new version was coming up, I was ecstatic and having been waiting so long for it to finally arive. My hopes were high for a good reason, because Capcom delivers. It is a fun game, easy to pick up, and it looks gorgeous. Online play is nice to finally have and my brother and I are still battling it out with Ryu and Ken with a big smile on our face.

On the normal setting dude is rediculously cheap, constantly grabbing and teleporting, this does not change when you lower the difficulty setting to EASIEST. The final boss is needlessly difficult. That's a turn off about this game. I probably would not recommend this game to anyone and I'm trading it in for Modern Warefare 2, atleast with that game teh difficulty is realistic!!!",2,0,3,93,415,12,139,6,8,64.66,8.09,8.53,11.36

"I can't believe how much hype the new Street Fighter IV has been getting. After getting my thrills from Soulcalibur IV, MK vs DC, and Virtua Fighter, playing the new Street Fighter IV was like going BACKWARDS in video game evolution! My little cousins who I tried to get to play with me were wondering if I pulled out the old Super Nintendo to play this game and I had to convince them that this was a 'brand new game for the Xbox 360'. The combo and ultra systems are very confusing. Even using old favorites such as Ken and Ryu was just disappointing. For a 2D game, it's okay overall. But this is the 21st century and video game fighters have evolved a LOT since the 90s. Even Mortal Kombat has stepped it up a notch (even though their main lure was the gore which was incredibly toned down with their latest release). I wanted to return my SFIV game after trying to tolerate learning it for a few days. I've had it. This game made my Mortal Kombat vs DC game look like the game of the year. If you're a die hard Street Fighter fan, this game is for you. But a game that hangs on to mainly combos and counters? No finishers? Annoying announcer voice?

"Ace Combat 7 is an excellent entry into the series. It is a massive improvement over the last entry, Assault Horizon. I like how there is more to unlocking aircraft and upgrades through the Aircraft Tree. The weather effects and terrain features are so realistic that you feel like your actually flying in the plane. It's a little more stripped down so far, after 3 missions, it looks like they took out the command feature, which didn't really work well, and having multiple operations which you had to choose 2 or 3 to complete the mission. Like previous Ace Combat games is more of an arcade game and it is not realistic in the number of weapons your plane carries. It's more of an arcade flight game. Overall I would recommend this game to fans of previous Ace Combat games or anyone looking for a great arcade flight combat game.",5,3,0,153,669,16,223,8,9,64.12,9.07,8.36,11.83

If you've played any of the Ace Combat games in the series and enjoyed it, then you will probably enjoy this as well. The game looks great on the Xbox One X. For the most part, the game feels and runs smoothly. I don't really play the game for the story, but mostly for the feel of flying a jet aircraft in combat.

If you're looking to play the most recent Ace Combat, it is what you would expect. If you haven't played before, it's nice that there is a game like this out there.

A lot of the same abilities from the last game with a bunch of new one. You are able to control an RC car and fly a drone to assist you in missions, profile from the air and solve puzzles. Hacking puzzles are now open world instead of on terminal server. The game relies to much on the drone to complete missions. If you try to go in anywhere guns blazing you will die. Multiplayer is / was broken they are patching the game (2 patches have released so far). Hard to connect to multiplayer games...must restart system / load another game to dump the memory to connect online (could be fixed by now). High memory usage, lags out the system.

If you beat it in 4 hours you played on easy and skipped all the Easter eggs. This game was made for true fans of The Merc With The Mouth!!!!",5,18,2,101,430,7,138,8,5,78.43,5.46,6.89,7.82
"This game cannot be compared to games like 'The Last of Us' or 'Batman: Arkham City' as it is not as technical or in-depth as games like that BUT if you are a fan of Deadpool then this game is a must have. This is the funniest game I have ever played. No game before this one has ever had me actually laughing to the point of tears. The action can be a bit repetitive at times but that does not mean the game is not fun. There are some wonderful animations that go with his combos and when you perform his momentum moves. Silent kills can be performed in certain areas and each weapon has 2 different silent kill animations. Each weapon also has numerous upgrades available. The writer of the game, Daniel Way, also a writer for the Deadpool comics, totally nails the character again for this game. Combined with the voice genius of Nolan North, Deadpool is never at a loss of words when fighting a group of villains or making anatomy size jokes while standing at a urinal. This game is meant to just pick up the controller, mash some buttons, and decapitate and maim endless waves of enemies. I believe it was Activision and High Moon Studios' goal to create a simplistic but extremely fun game that is not taken too serious due to that is not in the character's nature and for that I believe they have succeeded. Deadpool is the Three Stooges of the Marvel Universe and this game does a perfect job of capturing him and all his crazy 4th wall breaking hijinks. 4 out of 5 stars easy!",4,9,0,279,1182,27,394,13,10,65.58,9.44,7.73,12.46
"I was really excited for this game to come out on Xbox 360. However, after playing it, I'm a lil disappointed. While Deadpool's inner and outer dialogue with his multiple personalities as well as other characters in the game is nothing short of comedic genius, the storyline, or lack thereof, is slightly disheartening. Also, from level to level, it starts to feel fairly repetitive. The graphics, audio and gameplay is pretty good for the most part. The witty banter, the use of other characters from the Marvel Universe and the leveling up system are enough to keep you playing...BUT...I do find myself (often) wishing for better and more diverse levels. They're far too linear to call 'Deadpool' a 'great' game. Another aspect I find bothersome are the enemies. It feels like they go straight from being a normal, fair difficulty to being far too difficult fit where you are, and what you have to use in the game. All in all, of you're a Comic fan or a Deadpool fan specifically, you can find a decent amount of entertainment in the game, but don't expect anything epic. I would recommend either renting it first or waiting for a price drop.",3,3,0,207,903,28,315,13,8,61.93,8.58,7.99,11.78

"I love the game. It's funnier than all heck and Nolan North is a scream throughout the whole game. The developers really captured Deadpool's insanity and then some. The game has me howling with laughter and my favorite part ever in the game is the part after Deadpool flies the jet, crashes it, and tries to wake up Wolverine by slapping him across the face over and over and over and over again. What I don't like about the game, however, are the graphics and a lack of good battle dialogue. But I'll gladly see past that to play the game itself.

"Any fans of Deadpool would do themselves a great disservice by not purchasing and playing this game. I'm a Deadpool novice and still had a blast playing through the entire single player campaign. Previous history or familiarity with Deadpool is thankfully NOT required. The dialogue can get pretty blue and juvenile at times, but Nolan North's delivery had me laughing throughout the game. Controls are tight and responsive and the upgrade system based on DP (Deadpool Points) is rewarding and adds multiple layers of gameplay. My only complaints are in regards to the camera breaking when boxed into a corner. Lack of enemy variety and a severe difficulty spike on the last level where everything is thrown at you - including the kitchen sink. That being said, I still had loads of fun with Deapool.",4,1,0,136,651,19,215,8,10,55.84,9.69,10.61,12.39
"It's a sold game. One of the best comic based games I've played. It does well to represent how he is in the comics. But is definitely meant for adults.",4,1,0,32,116,2,40,4,0,92.97,2.28,1.82,5.7
"Bought this game after watching a video of someone getting some of the Achievements for it. At first I was a little hesitant about getting it because I knew barely anything about Deadpool. Thankfully you don't have to in order to enjoy the game. As the title suggests, the game is about Deadpool a mutate mercenary for higher from the Marvel Comics universe and a character that is constantly breaking the 4th Wall. The game starts off with Deadpool taking on a contract and then the story takes off from there. Depending on your skill level, the difficulty you play on and whether or not you want to get all the achievements, gameplay can last from 6-35hrs. The game uses its character's affinity for absurd dialog and actions quite well. High Moon leaned on this heavily and there's barely a scene where Deadpool doesn't do something to make you laugh. High Moon also made sure to include a lot of 4th Wall breaking goodness. Taking heavy amounts damage will have Deadpool telling you to give someone else the controller, pets included, and deaths will earn you a quick rant. There are a few instances in the game where Deadpool will go so far as call up the Development team to complain about what is happening in game. Story wise, the game is sort of straight forward. Sort of as in, you are playing Deadpool's game and there is other stuff going on, but it is not important to Deadpool. There is a general 'stop the bad guy, save the world' theme, but the exact nature of this is thrown out by Deadpool himself and you never actually learn what the bad guy is trying to do. The game is pretty much linear and doesn't offer a branching storyline of some sort. Comedy plays a heavy hand in everything, but this unfortunately makes replay value drop quickly. One can only hear the same joke so many times before it gets old. Gameplay wise, it's 'use various weapons to kill a bunch of a bad guys'. There isn't that much variety in the enemies in the game. You will see same guys throughout the game with the only difference being what grouping they appear in. There are a total of 4 boss battles in the game and the latter 2 felt somewhat lazy. Case and point, the final battle is that you have to progressively battle 20-30 of the same guy, with only a slight variation in each wave. Navigation is quite easy with a pretty linear path and very few puzzles to deal with. Unfortunately the linearity of things made backtracking impossible. There were a few instance where after you jumped on a ledge, the game would set the death line immediately below the ledge so jumping backing down to get your loot from an enemy, that you may have knocked of the edge, was impossible. One of my biggest qualms with the game was checkpoints. There are several points where the game will screw you over with checkpoints. Depending on where a checkpoint is set to go off, you may end up fighting guys you have killed before triggering it. In the last level, you have to kill 2 melee enemies and a flying enemy. After killing them and triggering the checkpoint you would expect to never see them again, well that is not what happens. When you return to the checkpoint all 3 will be waiting for you and you have to fight them again with the same ammo you had when you triggered the checkpoint. This made it extremely annoying when you have to use only 2 specific weapons to get an Achievement. Another major flaw is the spacing of the checkpoints. There were a couple of occasions where you have to battle some seriously annoying enemies and then battle some more in the next area with no checkpoint inbetween. If you died, then you have to repeat both battles again. Achievement wise, they are all pretty easy with only the 300 hit combo and the 5 medals in challenge mode providing any difficulty. Aside from the checkpoints and lack of variety in the enemies, the game was quite fun. Depending on your skill level, the comedic dialog might keep you playing the game if you start with the games hardest difficulty. In terms of pricing, the game would be better priced at 39.99, but is fine at 49.99. If you are looking for a game to make you laugh, then this is your game. I have never laughed as hard at a videogame before. Here's hoping for either a sequel or maybe some good DLC. Note: I started the game on the hardest difficulty #Ultra-Violent# and used the other difficulties to get the Achievements I missed. In total it took me 32-35 hours to beat the game and get all the Achievements.",4,1,0,830,3574,79,1175,46,8,68.76,8.15,7.88,11.02

"The short version. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is a fantastic game, especially if you happen to be a fan of Dragon Ball. Xenoverse 2 fixes a lot of issues that the first game had but it created some new problems along the way and sadly ripped a lot of its content from the first game. All that said, here is what it comes down to. If you played the first game, wait for a price drop. If you didn't play the first game. This one is THE Dragon Ball experience bar none. The long version Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is fun, it is. But most of the story and the side quests are lifted right from the original. And if you happen to transfer your character from the first game you see them maybe 5 times over the course of the game and then never again. You can't even pick them as a playable character in side quests or Expert Missions which I found to be a little disappointing. All that said, there are some redeeming values here. The hub is huge and once your character gets their flying license its really immersive to fly around Conton City looking for side quests and training with your favorite Dragon Ball heroes. Getting new attacks, and clothing options is much easier, and the game is much more balanced. (Though not perfect) The biggest new feature is the new Expert Missions which can be played with 6 people. These are fun if you can get 6 people together and they do provide a nice challenge. However this creates the biggest problem, when doing Expert missions or any mission for that matter. At the time of this writing, only the party leader gets credit for completing them. You can still get new attacks, items, clothing, EXP and Money but the game does not recognize YOU completed it. In other words if you and your 5 friends want to complete all the expert missions will need to play each expert mission 6 times for you all to get individual credit for completing it. Overall the game has a lot of content, and as I said if you didn't play the original you will get the most out of it. If you did, I would suggest waiting for a sale or price drop.",4,2,0,390,1628,26,532,22,8,73.44,7.42,7.08,9.76

"From the very first cutscene to the last, the translation of the Harry Potter movies over to a Lego games was done without flaw and with much attention to detail. The voiceless acting and added humor makes the game so much more approachable for any level of Harry Potter fan. The gameplay is much like other Lego games, but throws in a magical twist. With the ability to learn new spells throughout the game, the interaction with the world evolves and is already a very lively aspect of the hub world. The music is flawlessly scored and makes the experience absolutely authentic. The graphics are smooth and very well made to feel like Harry Potter while hanging on tight to the Lego-esque vibe of the playing field. Boss fights flow like you'd imagine they did in the movie, and by knowing the movies and its occurrences your knowledge of how to conquer the game is already partly in place; as far as battles and puzzles go. New characters are unlocked through going back and using all of your and current character arsenal making the lifetime of the gameplay double.

We found out the hard way about the poly juice 2 player glitch. We spent hours playing through the entire game, and wondered why we couldn't use the poly juice potion. Found out it was a glitch and how to fix it. Didn't know that when you fixed it (By watching a movie in the in game theater), that it would cause a fatal glitch in the game where you couldn't go any further. You're basically locked in a room, and the only way to fix it is to start all over again and play through 1 player. That's the first glitch. There's a TON more. There's the red brick 12 glitch that's a fatal glitch to the game resulting in having to start over. And then the game likes to freeze, A LOT! Go online, look it up, it's a super glitchy game. We actually contacted lego directly and they said that there's no way to fix the glitch(es), and then sent us a 10 dollar gift certificate for a lego product. (That is after spending 60 bucks on a glitchy game). It's a long game, with tons to do, so it's a grind to have to play through everything again.

It's clear the character design is meant to promote movie versions of characters here, which is dumb because people buying this game would rather see the comic representation and 2D hand drawn beauty that made this series famous. Menus are bland garbage as well, if you are the type that cares about presentation (I do). But after that, it's all good. The controls are fantastic and the mechanics are sound. The 2v2 change from 3v3 is fine and the ability to tag in and out during combos adds a new layer to the strategy. The infinity stones can be an added boost affecting different areas of your preference. Overall, still a lot of fun despite the more bland look compared to previous entries.

"It's a brainless superhero fighting game...at least, I thought that was the extent of the game. I was way wrong. The story mode plot is intelligently-designed and multi-faceted, and it can go in more than one direction. The characters and highly-customizable (even alternate versions for characters, e.g., Power Girl, Black Lightning, Grid, etc., and the alternates have their very own Super Moves). The pre-fight interactions between the characters was also unexpected, and the interactivity WITH the arenas was a great touch (you can throw objects, jump off objects, and hit your opponent into a totally different part of the arena). I was leery about paying extra for the Legendary version, but it's definitely worth it, in my opinion. Nods to Mortal Kombat, Killer Croc and TMNT were very well done.

"My 14 year old son has been wanting this and recently bought this game. Normally I can't get into what he buys as they are just too complex (I don't have that kinda time) or they involve too many buttons and too much 3D movement (yes, i'm old). However he was describing this to me and my husband, and we turned to each other and said 'it sounds like streetfighter.' We headed to his room, and took over. So much fun! I'm not sure that the three kids like having to share with their parents as much as they thought they would, but it's nice that we all get to finally have a game we can all play together. For those who think this might imply the game has limited complexity, I don't think that's the case. I think that is just how those of us unversed in modern gaming play it. My son takes it to a whole other level when he plays and how he upgrades his characters, etc. I just like that I can keep it simple and just play and still have time to connect with my kids in this way.",5,1,0,202,758,12,248,10,7,82.47,6.78,4.8,10.46

"The DC universe continues to succeed at adapting their properties into the gaming world. With the sequel to Injustice, however - it feels like this take has overstayed its welcome. The plot was a struggle to stay with as it veered into the ridiculous and just expected us to go along with the plot. Sticking with Superman as a continually untrustworthy villain grows old with the argument of the world is evil and only we can make it right... by any means necessary. The AI mechanics are also frustrating as you have to get superiorly skilled at combos to even stand a chance. The AI also tends to defy the rules of its own game at times as it becomes increasingly frustrating to maintain a pleasurable gameplay.",3,0,2,126,575,21,197,7,10,56.29,9.88,9.39,13.87

"I played the original State of Decay and that was a fresh take on the zombie apocalypse. State of Decay 2 is more of that with a multiplayer addition. The same survival mechanics of searching buildings for the five basics (food, materials, medicines, fuel and ammo) and using them to build your base is present. Of course, not all base sites can accommodate the same structures, so you will have to decide what is important to you. The addition of the plague hearts along with infestations was a bit nerve wracking, as the plague hearts can take a lot of damage. The ability to carry over your survivors as a 'legacy' is also a nice touch. I have a couple of complaints that make the game frustrating. 1. Sometimes, a member of your community will have a 'personal' quest. If you are using that character when the quest pops, you cannot switch characters without cancelling the mission. This is extremely frustrating as you will not be able to load up your 'follower' with the correct inventory. (Think follower with a broken melee weapon. You won't be able to equip them with anything now.) 2. Sometimes your follower 'disappears' during a quest. For some reason they won't get back in your vehicle. You might even seen them on the mini-map, but they will not be around. If you return to base, I've had a hard time finding the 'lost' follower. Until you tell your first follower to 'leave' you can't pick up another one. If you're on one of those personal quests, you can't switch off the character to the missing one to see where they are. This is very frustrating, because you really don't want to be out in the land all alone. 3. Sometimes when you are face to face with your follower (who has been missing, and sometimes they've not been missing) and you try to switch characters, the characters warp to another part of your base. So, now you will have to try to find the character that you were just using within your base in order to realease them and pick up a new follower. Overall, I like the game. I was a fan of the first, and I'm a fan of the second even with with annoying bugs. It has RPG elements along with a simplistic combat system. You can waste a lot of time with this game.",4,3,0,413,1720,50,580,28,6,73.06,6.73,6.68,10.74

"If you're looking for a zombie killfest, this is probably it. The game's mechanics are good, and the gunfights and melee combat are very good and the control are tight; however, the game has some problems with simpler things such as vehicle physics (like getting stuck on guardrails, getting stuck going off-roading in ditches and rocks, and in multiplayer if two players are driving separate cars near each other and collide the cars can catapult or destroy each other almost comically), being bogged down too many missions while you're doing other things (and thusly you can lose allies who feel neglected and leave because you've been stuck neck deep in zombies trying to navigate through the town), and slow patches because Microsoft has to go through a lengthy process of approving the patch even though the game developer's have had it ready for weeks or longer. TL;DR: I would recommend if you're looking for a zombie shoot-em-up with simpler base building aspects; with that in mind, know that some of the cars physics can be strange, the game is still a little buggy, and patches are going to be trickled in slowly.",4,1,0,202,903,14,287,3,34,18.29,27.44,10.05,29.71

This game keeps you busy with objectives, looting, and fighting off zombies. I would have definitely given 5 stars; however, 1 star has to be deducted based on the mechanics alone. The game has its moments of being buggy, especially when driving in a vehicle during multi-player. The graphics could be way better, considering this game was released in 2018. Also, (not 100% sure but...) you can't search and join random online players. I believe you can only play with people you know and send invites to.

Organizing and strategically deciding what you're going to do is a blast that sets my mind at ease. This game does sometimes try and randomly throw a lot at you, but since it's going for a more 'realistic' zombie apocalypse, it fits. You're not going to be able to help everyone, you are going to have people die, you will have to scavenge for supplies. But the joy of being in this living world that has a back story that eventually brings everything together is just too much fun to miss out on in my opinion.

"This sequel has a lot of great things going for it, but has some inherent flaws that consistently remove you from the otherwise amazing experience of thriving day by day in the zombie apocalypse. Starting out with the great things about this game: -Fun, fun, fun -Immersion -Challenging -Unpredictable AI This game is similar to its predecessor, but with improvements in terms of managing your base, your community's needs and wants, and the constant worry of contracting the deadly Blood Plague virus if you're consistently attacked by bloodied zombies, or infected zeds, who are far more aggressive in nature. The challenge gets bumped up as you collect more survivors, figure out how to keep all of them alive and happy, and hoping that you don't encounter some zed specialists on your next venture to retrieve daily necessities to keep it all going. You never know what is lurking around the corner in this game. Now for the cons, the negative aspects of the game that really break the immersion on many occasions, and inevitably causing you to reboot the game... -Buggy gameplay (getting stuck, interface disappearing, sidekick's whereabouts unknown -Unintuitive menu complexity and presentation -Graphics aren't any better than the original (enhanced) release -Music tends to cut out at random -Reboots needed to fix game-breaking errors While the game can be really fun and pull you into its amazing world of immersion, the quests do get repetitive after a long while, the music will sometimes just stop suddenly, the contextual menu system that has you managing your base is overwhelming at first, and the worst part of it all is after a good boss fight (a.k.a. the Juggernaut), your whole interface will just inexplicably disappear, preventing menu selection, base management, character progression, GPSeverything. The game will keep running, but you lose insight into what is happening around you. This happens mostly after a climactic scene after defeating a boss, for some strange reason, and the only solution is to restart the game to fix every bug that has been accumulating during your play time. That is very annoying! Hopefully these technical glitches get fixed because they almost ruin the whole game. Despite these shortcomings, when the game is running really well, it's impressively fun across the board. You play at your own pace, chart out your character growth, and grind through until you make your goals a reality. If you've enjoyed the original game, then this is a no-brainer. This is better in a lot of aspects even though the first game ran better consistently.",4,1,1,436,2095,70,695,17,15,45.95,13.22,11.3,16.68

"First things first, I am playing this on the Xbox one X connected to a Sony 4K TV with HDR. This game is tough to even know where to begin. Story, graphics, mechanics, everything is the the best I have ever seen. To begin with story, I was blown away the twists and turns this game took me down. Mind you, I am at the end of chapter 6 with every side mission completed thus far and also I've done a lot of hunting and fishing for legendary animals/fish. I probably am 55+ hours in and I still feel like there is so much I have left to do. While the game starts out very slow, it's for good reason. There is a lot to learn but once you understand how to play the game, there is nothing like it. The main story itself has wow'd me, the end of chapter 4 going to chapter 5 took me places I never thought the game would have and the entire chapter 5 was constant heart racing action. Going into chapter 6 it leaves you feeling lost, like things have really changed and while the first half of the game it seemed like they had it all figured out, that may not be the case anymore. I won't spoil too much but I'm telling you, chapter 6 really took things in another direction and it makes you sit on the edge of your seat wanting more. Even without the story, the games side missions feel like mini story mode quests. They're so detailed and there is real emotion grabbers built into them. You get invested in them just as much as the main story itself. Outside the story and side missions there is still a million things to do. The map is incredibly massive, it's alive with people, animals, and vegetation everywhere you go. You could be trotting along a random path and a stranger will ask you for help. You feel like hunting or fishing? Go for it, I don't know how many animals and fish are in the game but it feels like hundreds and you want to keep finding more so you can fill up your journal. There is so much to do in this game it's hard to explain it all. My only complaints for this game are the ways to get around the map, it's not easy to fast travel. If you're in the middle of nowhere hunting and kill a bear, skin it, and put it on the back of your horse, the trapper to sell the pelt to may be really far away and there is no train or stage coach near by. So those cases suck. Also, trying to hitch your horse was a little clunky but since the update it has really improved. Besides those little things, I can't think of anymore negatives. Overall this is the most incredible game I have every played and as the cherry on the cake, graphics are the best I have ever seen. If you're on the fence about this game don't be. I guarantee it will be game of the year and if it isn't, I will be very surprised (Yes I have played God of War and Spiderman and in my opinion, God of War may be close but Spiderman is out of Red Deads league). Best of all, online play for this comes out the end of the month which I'm super pumped for, I hope to have the game beaten by then. Let me know what you think of my review in the comments!",5,4,0,618,2355,31,787,30,7,78.19,7.47,5.17,10.25
"I was terribly disappointed by RDR2. While visually stunning and smooth running during gameplay, Rockstar Games has bogged this title down with endless management details that greatly impact gameplay. The original RDR had some of this but for the sequel they have amped it up to the Nth degree forcing you to constantly waste in game time eating, sleeping, bathing, brushing your horse, smoking and other tedious actions that can't be disabled. I have been told they want to keep the experience 'real' but when you only have a limited time to sit and play each week, spending 30 minutes doing these things just becomes ponderous. Now you have to monitor your body temperature if you can believe that. Wearing that heavy winter coat while in the desert will cause you harm. If you eat too much or too little, it also impacts your character's health, rarely if ever for the player benefit. The game is so bogged down in these tedious details that it kind of saps the fun out of just enjoying the pretty scenery. I have more than 20 hours of gameplay invested and I still don't really know what the ultimate story is about or what my version of Arthur Morgan is expected to do. Deadeye drains so rapidly that combat against groups of lawmen or bounty hunters is a constant repeat of live, shoot back, die and respawn that it is likewise not especially fun. Each time you die you lose money. The more times you get killed in a gameplay hour, the amount of your money you lose also increases. Committing robberies or other shenanigans to increase your holdings is also bogged down with ridiculously tiny amounts of currency or valuables making it difficult to actually get the stake together you need to really begin the main quest line. With no way to lower any difficulty settings or ways to adjust and reduce the more tedious elements of the game it has been thus far for me, not nearly as much fun as it is bland repetition. Some might argue that you just have to build up to being a better character and the gameplay improves but again, when you have a limited time for gaming and just want to enjoy, it gets frustrating after a while. I recognize that I am probably one of the few who finds this system more of a nuisance than a quality feature but I think they overdid it in the 'realism' department. Even the mini-game where you sit down to play poker with random folks has become more time consuming than the original as you are limited in when you can 'skip' the cut scenes. You have to sit there after each hand while a computer player collects the cards and passes them to the next dealer....every, single hand. Just a constant time waste that might be more realistic but it sucks the joy out of playing. In a nutshell, this is a visually stunning game with pretty good mechanics and a deep and I am told, well written story - but Rockstar Games has micro-managed a big chunk of the fun out of it. Cheat codes are readily available online but be WARNED - activating any cheat code will disable all achievements and make it IMPOSSIBLE to save your game and this effect is permanent as soon as you activate a cheat. Even if you disable the cheat, you are still locked out of saving your game. IF you do activate a cheat, be sure to have at least one SAVE GAME without the cheats prior to activating them or you will never be able to save the game period. This effect is apparently permanent.",2,6,2,623,2718,75,910,25,12,57.97,11.36,8.67,14.78

"Ive lived out on AZ for 4 years, worked out of the Reservations, and Ive seen the vast deserts, Mesas, and the forest and mountains of Flagstaff area, and I can with absolute certainty (at least from my perspective) the game is more fun than the real thing. Hiking and horseback riding through the wilderness is great and all, but the heat, cold, bugs, poisonous snakes, unwanted tan (and still smelling like sunscreen), and all the other annoying stuff I can do without. The story is well written. The adventure is fun and fulfilling. If all games were this good, I wouldnt be able to keep a stable job.",5,2,0,109,475,11,151,5,10,67.51,9.26,8.47,12.76
"This is my first experience with this series and I'm very impressed. The graphics are excellent, but I really like the story driven elements more and it's really fun to play. I like how they made the environment react to your actions more than most games, so going around killing people will have real consequences. Though I do think they overestimated how quickly law enforcement in this time period would have found out about things, the game acts like they have global hawk surveillance drones watching you 24-7, so even if there are no survivors the law still finds out.",5,2,0,103,464,12,153,4,13,55.03,11.98,9.54,14.96
"When numerous early previews called this game one of the 'Best In The Past Ten Years,' I simply laughed! I am admittedly a fan of the GTA series, but this game blows away anything done previously by Rockstar. You will truly get your money's worth with this one. There is something for almost every type of gamer in this title. Anyone considering themselves a gamer will try this game and hang on beyond the first few hours, at least until the epilogue/training is done. That is where the game truly begins and the world opens up for exploration. No spoilers, but this title is not a true sandbox because you are somewhat guided by and contained within the story. I would wholeheartedly recommend this experience to every friend and anyone else willing to listen. If this recommendation has helped you in anyway, please check it as Helpful, so that it may help others.",5,2,0,155,696,14,228,9,9,64.91,8.48,8.88,10.5
"This is an amazing achievement in gaming. Rockstar have once again outdone themselves to create a living and vibrant world with excellent characters and storytelling. Gameplay is married to the storytelling in all the best ways. The visuals are impeccable especially on the Xbox One X with its native 4K support. HDR unfortunately is abysmal thankfully the SDR is quite good already. While controls are quite good there is a heavy feeling due to lengthy animations which makes you feel like your walking through thick mud at all times. After getting used to this can be forgiven. Altogether this is an unmissable game and improves upon the rockstar formula in every possible way.",5,2,0,113,559,21,185,8,9,53.99,9.24,11.19,13.08
"Read Dead Redemption 2 is a direct prequel to the first title released over seven years ago. This title shows a tale around Arthur Morgan, a member of Dutch van der Linde's gang. This title plays exactly like the first game, particularly with regards to the horse, movement and gunplay. A number of famous voice actors were brought back to reprise their roles in Red Dead 2 as well, van der Linde's character in particular. Rockstar crafted another another excellent story, and even though I haven't completed it yet, I am highly engrossed and want to keep playing further to see how everything unfolds. The story for this game is much, much longer than the first game. Expect a playthrough of over 50 hours to complete this title. If you're looking for a single player game with a great story, this game is a must purchase. If you played the first title and want to see how this prequel ties into the first game, you probably already made the purchase and are playing this right now.",5,2,0,180,787,14,259,9,10,64.81,9.19,8.43,11.11
"-It's real purdy. -It's real big -It's real deliberate. This is a game that seems to have taken to heart how I played RDR and spun it out as far as you can go. You need to slow down and play at the pace it's built for rather than try to push it. But that works perfectly for me. I never run (unless I have to to get things done), I never push my horse (again, see above). The rhythms of a time long gone feel great. It has some control quirks but I've adapted to those pretty well. Highly recommended.",5,2,0,107,378,5,133,9,2,89.61,3.71,2.48,6.62

"Make no mistake, if you bought this version of the game for the Xbox One X, you are playing the best version of the game. The art direction, the cinematography, the voice acting and animations are all top notch even for Rockstar standards. But what puts it over the top is this is probably the best looking game on the market, even better than PC games that are out now in terms of overall appearance. You're not going to get more than 30 FPS until it maybe comes to PC, so until then, this is as good as its going to get. Also kudos to BestBuy for getting this to me on release day, they missed it in the past with Destiny 2 and I wasn't happy about that at all.",5,3,1,133,518,7,178,5,11,66.61,10.58,5.99,12.75
"Much of the gameplay is detrimental to the enjoyment of the game. The first few times I played, I killed my horse, had a bounty placed on my head for running someone over with my horse, then shot and killed by lawmen when I accidentally bumped into someone while on my way to pay off the bounty. The next few hours of gameplay were spent trying not to get killed by gangs, thrown off my horse, or getting attacked by wolves. Only to come back to another bounty on my head when I turned my console back on after not playing for a few days. How did I get a bounty when not playing? No idea, but that's not the first time it happened. After a week of gameplay, I threw this game in the garbage and deleted it from my Xbox One.

It's graphically impressive and the level of detail far exceeds the original; however, it should be stated that sometimes the game is not what a typical gamer would consider 'fun.'

"The Highlights: The graphics - 10/10 (Every detail has been considered and brought to life from the clothes and weapons right down to rainbows that appear and disappear under the right weather conditions). The sounds - 10/10 (The sounds of the late 1800s are there and the weapons, surroundings, and equipment sound just as they should). The gameplay - 10/10 (There are plenty of missions and side quests to keep you busy. This is a true open world experience where life will continue on in the world regardless of what you decide to do in it, even if it's taking a few days for yourself to go hunting or exploring). The immersion - 10/10 (From horses that actually lift their tails to poop to the 1800s styled catalogs at vendors, this game keeps you immersed). The controls - 8/10 (The controls can be a little clunky, but nothing game breaking. I have had no real issues aside from when I was on my horse. Watch your speed and direction, if you hit a large rock/boulder or tree too hard you can hurt yourself and your horse. Note: Horses do not make tight turns while in motion and can have a mind of their own at times, especially when in danger). Final notes: The characters in the world notice you and will remember everything you have done from a wild night out to beating someone down to gunning someone down in the street. When you knock someone unconscious or beat them in a gun fight, do not loot them until you have moved the body to a secure location where nobody can see you. If you are seen, you can be sure the witness(es) will run to the law nearest them to turn you in.",5,1,0,297,1246,22,392,12,11,70.05,9.64,7.67,12.86
",,, there's a lot of hours to be spent on here. As a return on investment, it's a no-brainer. It's fun and entertaining with so much to do. The graphics are amazing; the graphic details are the same between the PS4 (pro) and the Xbox (X) but the sound on the Xbox is better than the PS4. The character controls are a little clunkly for modern games and the story unfolds pretty slowly (that's intentional) but when the action begins (out of nowhere!) you can quickly die if you're not prepared, which can be frustrating.

"The long-awaited sequel to Red, Dead Redemption is the most visually stunning game I've ever played. You feel like you're watching a movie, not playing a game (until, you know, you have to shoot at some bad guys). And if violence or hunting animals (the 'skinning' scenes are quite graphic) doesn't appeal, you can play poker or dominoes or just go fishing (and, yes, you can throw the fish back). Rockstar Games has created a vibrant world with just about any kind of earthly terrain or weather conditions you can imagine. Even after playing the game for MANY hours thus far, I can still be surprised...like when an alligator took out a gunman that was trying to kill me in a swamp. Or when I was besieged in the dark (in the same swamp) by some weird voodoo men painted like skeletons. And so on.

"RDR@ is a beautiful game that has interesting charcaters and a story that is very close to realistic while still being a game. I believe most people will like this game. I loved Red Dead Redemption 1 as well as all the 3D GTA games, but RDR2 is the appearance of a sandbox game. To be clear, this is my opinion, I do not expect everyone or even anyone to share it. It's actually very linear from my 5 hours of experience. I spent at least 90% of my time talking to other characters and watching cut scenes. You are introduced to so many characters that when you see them in the open world they ask as if you have this history with them that you have no knowledge of. And when you do finally get to actually play the game, you're only allowed to run where they say you can, grab guns when they say you can, and don't walk too far away from a mission, you will fail with no warning. There are more bugs in the game than I've seen in some BETAs. The honor system rewards you for being 'good' and punishes you for being 'bad', but during almost every cut scene the main character is portrayed as a 'bad guy'. Kill a guy who saw you commit a crime that's story related, bad. Kill a guy who saw you kill some random dude punching your friend, no problem. They system is only active when they want it to be, but they don't tell you when that is. They have slowed item selection by making you hold the X button to collect anything or to hold the Y button to inspect. Why pressing these buttons when prompted is not good enough, I do not know? To summarize, it's like watching a movie that you occasionally get to interact with button presses. The only true open world part of it is when you're outside of a mission wandering around. But Rockstar used to be the fun game that let you approach missions any way you want, but not in RDR2. Things are set up in ways that make take me out of the game play and that stinks. Again, these are just my opinion and I know everyone else is loving it. I hope they keep loving it, but it just wasn't for me.",2,2,4,406,1586,29,536,21,7,75.52,7.53,5.64,10.59

Might be better by the time it comes out on PC, but all I can say is save often and plan on redoing things over and over to get it to work.",1,1,9,93,377,6,125,5,7,74.25,7.52,6.44,10.02

I have already met others who play the game and have said, 'It is so life-like that I sometimes forget I'm playing a game.' That does not sound good. Rockstar worked hard on it, they did a great job on it, it is entertaining...nevertheless, this is an issue of society, philosophy, and wisdom. Do you want your children and future adults to revel in cruelty, criminality, and violence? This game is great after a day of retail work, but you should have to be...like...30 years old or above to play.

"I'm a mature gamer chick and I love this RPG. It's so cool that characters from the first two games make appearances again here. The detail and the story line are interesting and exciting to play. I love making armor and weapons for my character and my followers as well. It takes over a hundred hours to just play the main story line. If you do all the side quests it can take twice as long. It's so much fun to play again as different races, different skill sets and different love interests to see how that changes the story.",5,2,0,103,418,11,142,7,6,75.27,6.42,6.05,10.16

"This game is most definitely a throwback! It harkens back to the days when F1 2010 was the new thing on the video game market in a good way! It brings post session interviews back into the equation and the way you answer each and every question affects your relationship with your team in a truly dynamic way. For example, if, in your post qualifying interview, you mention that the chassis handled well, then the chassis dept of your team will be happy and thus, chassis upgrades will cost fewer resource points to acquire. If you downplay the chassis, then the chassis department's morale will decline, and you will be forced to spend more resource points on chassis upgrades. This goes for every aspect and department of your car's R&D. Overall, this game is simply the most well thought out and developed game in almost a decade and i am very much looking forward to digging even deeper into it's various modes and challenges. If you are an F1 fan, then F1 2018 is a must to add to your collection!!!",5,1,0,185,801,18,262,8,11,63.55,10.14,8.38,13.14
"First of all the product itself. The launch edition has a really cool metal slipcase probably the only one of it's kind. We have had metal steelbooks sure but not a metal slipcase. Really cool. There is also a free japanese voice pack in the E-Shop you can download. Story - Pretty generic honestly, like PS2 Era JRPG storytelling. Have an evil kingdom who is doing evil stuff against the good kingdom... Insert main character here.... He goes on an adventure to save the kingdom from evil kingdom and bam there is your story. The lore is pretty intresting but the story itself just holds it back. It never gets into that level of final fantasy or tales games story telling. Gameplay - Plays out like a tales game, you can turn into a dragon! Which is awsome. There is like a FF7 materia system going on there for your wepons. No fast travel unfourtuntly, but not that bad as the maps themselfs are easy to run across. There is a random dungeon you can do for grinding. There are side quests but all those are is the basic 'Kill this' or 'Collect this' and thats it, nothing more meaningful than that. I guess the best part of the game is that you can date all the girls and you won't get punished for it. For those who are confused by original mode and refrain mode... Basically original mode is just the original story while in refrian mode you get 2 playable characters that are like villian characters.... Thats about it. So I just went with refrian mode to date the evil chick. Sound - Pretty good since one of the focuses of the game is about music, since all your party members items are actually instruments. So at least for sound is 5 out of 5 Graphics - It's like in between PS2-PS3 era anime style graphics. Not that bad seeing as it was a PS3 port from japan only. Conclusion - It's worth getting if only go play once, it's only like 49.99 anyways not even full priced. For a PS3 port it's pretty decent, at least until we get octopath traveler soon and that tales remaster for the switch.",5,6,0,376,1568,34,534,28,5,73.06,6.41,6.52,8.99
"Its a fun game and its got your fan service(Bonus) However, I cant help but feel the developers skimped on optimizing it for tv since its a switch game. You do get a interesting story about dragons and a fun combat mechanic. Bosses are ridiculously brutal(I spent two hours and still haven't beaten the first main boss). The game definitely feels laggy especially in bigger fights, the fps completely tanks, in portable mode, not so much. its a shame because I enjoy playing on my tv more than handheld. still a great game though------ 3.5 stars for me.",4,3,0,102,434,11,147,7,6,70.12,7.1,7.19,10.14

The campaign is absolutely fun and exciting to play through and the story keeps you engaged. The multiplayer is balanced with customization options. The guns are well designed and they are all fun to use and swap through depending on your class. The servers are very stable and matchmaking is fairly quick and simple. I haven't had any issues connecting to servers nor had any issues getting kicked off due to connectivity issues. Overall, I have and continue to highly recommend the game to anyone.

"This is one of the best, most well rounded games I've played since Witcher 3. The campaign is the first FPS campaign I've played in many years that was actually interesting and fun, and that I didn't just get bored with after a few hours and abandon it. On top of that, the multiplayer, while having some changes from the first game, feels more well rounded and complete than the first game. There is also no need to play the first game to understand what is going on in Titanfall 2. I actually was surprised how much I loved this game, to the point I bought it a second time for a friend (at full price) who had bought Battlefield 1 instead. Titanfall 2 has replaced Overwatch for me, and is easily one of the best games of the year. Don't overlook it just because it's not as established as Battlefield or CoD and was relased by EA at a terrible time (right between those two games).",5,1,0,172,696,16,226,7,10,70.73,9.5,6.79,13.55

"Game is classic tetris plus new features in gameplay, what's not to like there? However the music in the game is overrated and the use of a usb drive to replace the music of your own preference is highly suggested and mandatory. You can add Dark Knight Rises soundtrack to the fire background stage to great effect. Or Man of Steel soundtrack to the stage with the illuminated blue sea animals. It goes well together. There are plenty of other special effects added to the simple 2d graphics. However, just listening to some of the music in the game is pure torture. The reviewers rating the music so high are obviously high themselves. Lumines also had many examples of the same type of horrendous music. It seems like the only decent music in these Mizuguchi puzzle games were the Genki Rockets songs because they tended to be catchy rather than annoying. Let's talk about the stupid song that everyone raved about when this game came about. 'Weere all 2-gethah'.....that is such a lame song there should be a warning label on the package. Then after that comes a level with this rap song and monochrome background that sounds like it was ripped off from WWE superstar R-Truth, except it is so bad that R-Truth sounds 100 times better. 'What's Up - Golden Truth remix' would definitely be a better choice for the soundtrack then this trash. What's with the music in these games nowadays anyways? Most of the other music in the game have no lyrics. Some are decent but alot of them aren't.",3,105,2,272,1189,24,392,18,7,69.57,7.31,7.94,9.57

There are so many different modes and challenges and the visuals are awesome! You can play relaxing modes and just chill or really put your skills to the test with some crazy fast Tetris. The PSVR is NOT required and it is still amazing without it, the only difference is it is a bit more immersive in the headset, since it is more 3D. Either way, get it!",5,4,0,98,391,8,132,7,5,78.67,5.76,5.55,8.87
"This game is came from the maker of games like rez, lumines, and child of eden. They had been making an off-brand tetris for years with lumines, now it's like they just to actually do tetris in that same style. The visuals are wild, but you kind of can't watch them cos' you're trying to play tetris. if you can get someone to watch you to play tetris, this will definitely entertain. there is also some great music on here. by default the controller vibrates to the beat, but i actually had to turn that off after awhile, because some songs were too intense and i thought it would break the controller and some made my hands tickle. I switched the vibration to gameplay only, so it would only vibrate when i cleared some lines. anyway, if you like tetris you will like this game, if you hate tetris, you probably won't like this game. there is no multiplayer btw. this is classic tetris, while also something new at the same time. in journey mode, what the game describes as its 'campaign', each of the levels evolve as you progress through them, trying to hit the goal of clearing 36 lines, while scoring as many extra points as possible. oftentimes in levels, you will reach a point that triggers lightning fast tetris. but, as you will find, the game kind of lets you play a different way when you encounter this... you can drag the piece around the floor and keep rotating it for quite some time. once you experience it, you'll know what i'm talking about, it's bizarre, and brilliant somehow. i'm not sure it was quite like that in any previous iteration of tetris, but i'm mostly familiar with the gameboy version. for fans of that version, there is a 'secret' 1989 mode, while the look of it is pretty great, the sound seems to be purposely a little off, the music and sounds are similar, but altered versions of the originals. when the level progresses to it's final form, i'm not really a fan of their new version of the classic song. anyway, if you like tetris, and are thinking of getting this, you should probably get it. i don't have VR, so i dunno if that's good, but it probably is.",5,4,0,399,1639,32,539,20,8,72.3,8.13,6.87,11.19

"Brings back the 80's and 90's feel of Tetris with very low to no latency on the VR Headset, which is the best mode of this game. The unfortunate thing about this game is there is no local co-op so the family has to take turns getting high scores which is kind of not the point of Tetris especially playing multi-player. 30 stages are way more than enough for a single player and getting to the insane levels are impossible on the controller but possible on the VR headset. Watch the #1 player of Tetris play this game and he can get to the master levels only with the VR headset.

There have been some good Tetris games since then, and some not so good Tetris games since then. This is probably the best since the ground-breaking original. It's like a rhythm game for people for people who are terrible at rhythm games but great at puzzle games. Not all of the levels are my taste in visuals and/or music, but there is enough variety that everyone should find something they really like.",5,1,0,100,404,7,132,6,6,78.25,6.49,6.18,9.47
"The game is worth the price. It takes tetris to a new level. The game has multiple modes and unlockable stages. If you played the ds game you will mostly find all those modes plus some other in this game. The HDR isn't out of this world, you can only turn it on or off and there is no adjustment sliders. The default is off and buried in the option menu, which I found odd. You might find the tetris playing field is to small, but you can use the right stick to adjust the size or look around the level. The vr option is a cool add on to the game and it should be played with it, but it still works great without it. The music is perfect and your button presses and beats to the music. It works in perfect harmony. It really does take tetris to the next level. It's a must buy for people that want to play a classic game and great showcase game for people who don't play videogames or vr.",5,1,21,181,692,7,228,12,5,84.96,5.16,4.72,7.58
"Tetris will always be a great game with a formula that never needs to be changed, but Tetris Effect adds it's own elements that make it stand out from the many versions released in the past few decades. The music combined with the sound effects produced by the tetrominoes and visuals from the 20+ stages further draws players into the immersive and addicting world of Tetris. Along with the classic endless Tetris mode, the game includes a Journey mode for those seeking a sense of completion. This mode takes you through all the stages requiring players to clear a set number of lines at varying speeds, and when you run into trouble or want to set a higher score, players can activate the Zone meter to clear up to 16+ lines simultaneously. Tetris will be around for a long time and is available on almost any electronic device with a screen, but Tetris Effect emphatically places itself as the best version available now.",5,0,50,164,750,15,248,5,17,45.61,15.05,10.19,16.78

This will be a great cooldown game for me and you can just put it in the effects modes and most people will enjoy the light show.

The graphics are unbelievable you cant help but to wonder off and look at the scenery then play the game LOL. But for some reason when my nephew has his friend over some of them cannot play it. They find it difficult and hard I cannot match to make a line. I dont understand its not that hard. These are 14-year-old kids. Well this 42-year-old loves and would highly recommend this game back get ready for a head spin.",5,4,18,110,438,8,141,8,5,84.44,4.9,5.46,8.41

The visuals are spectacular, with bright colors, neon flourishes, and lush ambient patterns. The music is just as good, and reacts with the visuals to create an overall experience that makes this so much more than just Tetris. Add in the time-tested gameplay of Tetris itself, online leaderboards, multiple game modes, and you have a truly one of a kind experience. Can't recommend this game enough.

"If you love Gears of War, then this is a must buy. The gameplay, graphics, multiplayer and campaign are all the best yet of the series. That being said, the ultimate edition IS NOT worth the price of admission. I admit, I failed to do my homework on what the season pass (included with this edition, hence the price increase) included before purchasing, so that's on me. All of my past experiences with season passes meant that you were buying all the game DLC that will be coming out in the game, generally in the form on MP maps/etc. That IS NOT the case with this game. All of the MP maps will be free to all players, and will be released in a rotation (from what I understand). So, you must be wondering what the season pass includes? You get to have all of the DLC maps available at all times (even after they are out of rotation) for private matches and horde mode. Personally, this doesn't match my needs/expectations of what such a high priced (or any, for that matter) season pass should include. I don't play private MP matches, and could care less about Horde mode. Now, that's not the only difference in the ultimate edition...you also get a steel case instead of plastic one that the game comes in, as well as a couple in game packs for weapon skin/character/XP bonus card...that's a whole other mess in and of itself...it doesn't bother/affect the overall game for me, so it's not a negative as far as the core game is concerned. GoW4 get's a full five stars from me; however, the ultimate edition is a complete waste of money (IMO).

Still great gameplay we have seen from previous gears with a few upgraded details on mechanics. Ultimate edition comes with disc of gears of war 4 with season pass code.

"I love this game. I hate this game. I've uninstalled it multiple times in a rage, but I keep coming back. It is pretty heavy on the rng, so it's possible to lose characters even without taking big risks. But if you manage risk carefully and are serene enough to view your characters as a resource that can be expended, it is incredibly satisfying when you succeed.

"Ok so been waiting in the works on this one, Great New IP, Great Art Work, and Great fighting mechanics.... Think of this game as Fable on hardcore with more RPG. I love the fact that I am one charater picking from a sort of roles i can be, and yet mix it up... FYI Warrior Mage is tight, or might want to change it up still, but dont have to restart the game fresh... I love the professions in the game as well, but thought they could use a little more work, nice thing is there pretty simple. Did have some, and i do mean some gliches with sound on a 5.1 suround sound system, and changed it to my tv, same issue, and no its not my set up, works fine with everything else... But i would all of a sudden get no sound but my swords swinging, no boxes breaking, no talking, nothing... worked out fine when restared, has happened twice.... so might have a fix down the road if a know bug.... other wise great game, pick it up youll love it looking forward to whats next in the Amalur World...",5,11,1,196,748,10,242,11,6,84.29,5.93,4.98,9.17

I can't really point to a somgle 'wow' factor, but all of its parts go together well and before you know it, you've ended up running around doing RPG questy stuff for hours on end and having a good time in the process. The difficulty level of Normal seemed a little soft to me, but I have maxxed out smithing and sagecrafting so my armor and weps are much better that what the shops stock.

"Combat is very diverse. Unbelievably GREAT! But the role playing choices are disappointing as they make no difference in the outcome of that choice. The story is pretty good but your character choices don't really affect the outcome. Be it whether you choose one more controversial answer over the other the outcomes are the same, so if they would have married the excellent combat with the story development of each quest outcome that would have improved the game to Excellent! There is no follow through of the quest characterization. It is almost the exact opposite of Skyrim, where the combat is fabulous and much more colorful, but the choices I make in Skyrim really matter in the overall plot development. So if Amalur would have made the quest plot choices matter more then the whole game would be 5 out of 5!",4,2,0,143,664,18,218,8,10,59.72,9.37,9.85,12.18

I like being able to 'name' my weapon once I've built one, and the quests are endless. Mucho replay value. I'd honestly like to see more reviewers here compare & cotrast it with Skyrim, which I'm considering buying, but am hesitant, because since I have this one, I'm wondering why should I bother with Skyrim?",5,1,0,93,393,8,130,6,7,72.84,6.95,7.14,9.64
"I have been playing the game for 4 days now, I dont really pay attention to the storyline, I just like to do the main quests and the side quests. I am looking forward to beating every quest in the game. Its a very addictive game. I like the fact that you can roam around and break stuff. I dont like the fact that for some of the side quests you have to steal things, and when you steal things you either have to pay a fine, resist arrest, or go to jail. When you resist arrest it makes your fine go up, and you cant go back to that town until you have enough money to pay the fine, and if you go to jail they take everything that was in your invintory, including the weapons you need to continue.",4,1,1,141,543,8,176,6,9,77.38,8.3,5.58,11.67
"This game is so much fun! It sucked me in during the demo. After I unlocked all of the 'exclusive' weapons and armor from playing the demo I immediately pre-ordered it at my local bby! The graphics are very rich. The story line is intriguing, and I have played about 18hrs and am still finding new areas. My only complaint is the time it takes to navigate the menu system while in combat. This is a little frustrating because it takes awhile, but doesn't affect the combat, which is paused while accessing the menu. It would've been nicer to have a radial or some other kind of quick-select menu for weapons (there is one for potions while in combat) instead of opening menu, opening inventory, opening weapons, opening primary (or secondary), scrolling through everything I'm carrying to find the weapon I need and then hitting b repeatedly to back out. But the way I look at it is, if that is all that I'm complaining about this far into my game, then there are no real complaints! I love it.

"Now this is gonna make me sound like a hater for saying this but i must, first off this game takes good ideas from other games, god of war, fable, 'skyrim', yet lacks originality if you ask me. Why is skyrim so great? because ts original? this game does have pros and cons, pros in my veiw are you get to pick up all types of armor and weapons with neat effects, 'some' of the characters in th game are very well designed, cons in my view would be disenchanting chests and getting cursed is pretty annoying, there are a good bit of glitches as well, and last but not least CARTOON graphics are for rayman not rpgs, Skryim did so well because their graphics are oustanding and detailed. This game is the fable 1 it should have been but hey im just saying. I would recommend this to all the guys and gals who like to spend a huge amount of time on rpgs other than that i would say go buy rocksmith or better yet RESIDENT EVIL!!!",3,2,26,179,725,9,232,6,13,66.91,11.34,7.02,13.94

"This isn't a perfect game. It's a light role player with very limited options and the ability to control the actions of only a single character. Your party only walks in a straight line, with only occasional paths for you to pick. Weapons and equipment are not so much purchased as upgraded, as you have to buy each version to unlock the next, and the upgrades don't make any sense. The 3-D is present, but very weak. So, why the five stars? It's all about the Miis. Creating an avatar of yourself and choosing three companions, who could be anyone you can imagine. You can go with people you know, characters from popular culture, celebrities, historical figures, or people you invent yourself. The list is limitless. Not in the creating mood? There's always Mii Central, an online database where people post their own Miis for you to use at your pleasure. It also supplies the Miis which populate the towns and other minor characters (which you can change, should any prove not to your liking). Once you've chosen your team and cast the major roles (including the main bad guy), your set out on an adventure unlike any other. Where else can you watch your sister fall in love with Albert Einstein, see Han Solo and Doctor Who get jealous of each other, or the sight of Jesus Christ prancing around in a cat suit? If you weren't a fan of Tomodachi Life, you probably won't get much out of this, but for people like me who thoroughly enjoyed Tomodachi, this is the long-awaited (and probably only) follow up. Not sure if it's for you? Download and play through the demo. It's impressively long, and if, when you reach the end, you're itching for more, then this is for you.",5,1,0,313,1314,30,444,19,7,70.11,7.57,7.09,10.42

"Miitopia is a pretty fun RPG even though it's quite basic. Battles are turn-based and falls more inline with older RPG games. Meaning, you can control what your main character does, but not what your pals do. What your friends can do depends on the classes you choose for them and the personality you chose. Their personality traits show themselves in battle through quirks, both good and bad. Like Tomodachi Life, you're able to use your own Miis to stand in as the rest of the characters. This includes other Miis people have made and are shared online. This is possibly the most fun you're going to have with Miitopia. You can always change the roles as well, so don't feel like you're stuck with who you've chosen. Another part of this game is eating food. This seems to be taken from Tomodachi Life as well. At the end of every stage, your Miis rest at an inn where you can feed them. What they like and dislike is random. For example, you may find yourself bummed out that your mage doesn't like food that increases the Magic stat. Yet another feature that seems to be taken from Tomodachi Life is the friendship feature. As you and your pals spend time together during the evenings, as well as helping each other out in battle, your friendship level increases. This will unlock nifty bonuses that help a lot in battle. It might as well have been easier to say this is Tomodachi RPG. It's fun if you're not expecting much and don't need much out of an RPG to be entertained. However, if you're looking for something more complex (like me), you might be disappointed in your purchase. I still had fun with Miitopia, but I'm hard-pressed to finish the game because I feel I've seen everything it has to offer. The story isn't engaging enough (I've spoiled myself silly to write this review in good conscious) and the amount of battles between each story segment is long and repetitive with no real way to evade battles you don't want to fight. Miitopia is very 'hands off'... like Tomodachi Life. I can't see myself recommending this to others. They might get bored faster than I did.",3,1,0,394,1649,35,544,26,6,74.65,6.61,6.86,9.61

"Out of all the things EA could have done to improve on UFC 2, they redesigned the striking system that was perfectly fine. Terrible grappling and clinch controls? Great! Let's revamp the one solid aspect of the previous game. Ground controls remained untouched and are still confusing and unresponsive. The striking system makes this more akin to fighting games like MK or SF with the combo inputs. If you dig that kind of thing then you'll probably like this. But it felt like a step back from a very solid striking experience 2 years ago. Career mode is terrible with absolutely zero depth. All the added bells and whistles get old after about 2 hours of gameplay and you realize you're slogging through the same old garbage as usual.

"Gal Metal is wild, weird and cool. If you can embrace the vivid and wacky art style of the comic panel segments and strive for percussive nirvana, there is a refreshing, deceptively deep and gratifying experience here. What stops it from being truly great are the minor inconsistencies of the motion controls, the completely bonkers alien invasion plot and the slow, text-heavy teen melodrama stories. Even so, the game mostly succeeds by subverting many stale genre tropes. It will take time to master your set list and the absence of more contemporary music is initially jarring, but this is a title that is rewarding as well as just really fun.

"After reading reviews and raving recommendations from friends I took the leap and picked up AA:GOTY, and I'm thrilled that I did. The storyline feels like it could have been ripped right from the pages of the comics, a real treat for those familiar with the Dark Knight. The graphics are top notch, with fast paced action you can almost feel Batman thrashing the goons and villains, or the slow and careful sneaking and detective work you need to navigate your way around Arkham Asylum.. The added bonus of this version being in 3D wasn't much of a sell point to me, and since it didn't come with glasses I can't really rate how good/bad that feature was. But to me what really steals the show on this game is the voice acting talent, they really bring all of the characters to life in ways you could only hope for in a big budget movie. I also really enjoyed the addition for the PS3 version of getting to play as the Joker on the challenge maps, definitely a fun change of pace. As an avid gamer, this game goes way above and beyond what I'd hoped for and finally delivers a thrilling Batman experience on consoles. As a parent with young kids who are also gamers, while the atmosphere and some story elements were darker, it wasn't over the top and there is not massive amounts of gore or bad language to worry about. The kids enjoy the game just as much as I did, and the plus for me is that even my wife enjoyed watching me play it.

"How does the idea of a DIablo 3 clone without the charm, gameplay, graphics, music, writing, or fun of Diablo 3 sound? It sounds like... Warhammer Chaosbane! Let's look, shall we? Weapons and armor that, when equipped, barely change how your characters look. Almost none of the loot in this looting RPG, therefore, matters much. Everything is the same. The storyline, such as it is, is told exclusively through text boxes voiced by a very small handful of voice actors straining to make their roles sound different. While cheap and obnoxious, it was kind of amusing to hear one voice actor talk to himself in a Russian and British accent, both terrible, via two different characters. So bad. Each character gets a couple dozen skills and abilities, a tiny percentage of which are actually useful. This leads to repetition and boredom within hours of starting. The UI is a near identical clone of Diablo 3, a game I adore, but it's... tiny. So tiny. Everything is tiny. My eyes literally began to water and hurt as I played through this game, barely able to see the dwarf on my screen fighting his way through troves of baddies who all look alike. And fight alike. Even the weakest mob trash on easy mode takes multiple hits to defeat, rendering every single fight in the game tedious and boring. Sense a trend? Here's another trend: Vermintide 2, Inquisitor, and now Chaosbane, all failures, duds, and overall terrible games. Let's not keep this trend going, shall we? Avoid this title at all costs.",1,0,1,264,1182,33,399,23,6,67.32,6.72,7.95,9.59

"Like many of the other reviewers, I was won over by the games character design, music, and overall charm. Its a cute game, but I do feel there are some areas that aren't quite perfect yet. Maybe in the sequel the game will feel fully realized. 1. Having a three party team seems a little small. I feel like if I could have four people I wouldn't constantly have to go back to the oasis to get a different member to solve a puzzle. 2. When you meet a seedling in the wild, they will most likely want to join your team to complete a rather easy puzzle. Problem is, you will need to send one of you current members back to the oasis. I found that annoying as you have to go back again to get them in your party once the puzzle was completed. 3. There are lots of areas and boundaries you think you can squeeze passed or get around, but the game really likes using invisible walls to keep you where it wants. If I can't fit between the wall and that boulder, don't leave enough space to make it look like I can 4. I feel like the game is missing out with not having a jump button. Granted that would probably break a lot puzzle, but that could be reworked. Also, would also like a proper dash button as well. I know you can run a little faster when you sheath your weapon. but it would be swell to dash with B or something. 5. Some requests by the villagers can be a little obtuse. They will want a specific item from a monster drop. You figure, 'thats simple, the map tells me where to go' So you head to the spot and start killing the mobs there but none of them are dropping what you want. Turns out you have been killing the wrong monsters, because the right ones don't spawn until night time. But you wouldn't know that. Other times they will want an item from an area you have never been to and you have no idea how to even get there. So you have no choice but to watch them depart and hope they come back soon. Overall the game is pretty fun. I would recommend it if you are a fan of animal crossing, fantasy life, or zelda.

"I have not tried any multiplayer or soccer in Mario Sports Superstars yet as of this writing nor have I really used amiibo cards, so this is more like general impressions of the game. I, however, have played nearly all past installments of the various sports subseries, including Golf's Toadstool Tour (GameCube) and Advance Tour (Game Boy Advance), Mario Super Sluggers (baseball on Wii) and Mario Sports Mix (Wii). So I have much experience with these kinds of games and can speak with an expert opinion. I also think the amiibo functionality is a rip-off. The game's biggest selling point is also its biggest flaw. There are 5 sports, so there is variety. Unfortunately, none of them are really fleshed out. A good comparison to make for side-by-side value might be Wii Sports though there's more to MSS in terms of content. Those looking for the variety in modes per sport will only get some generic challenges and limited stadium or course variety. Only 36 holes in golf from 4 different courses, plus 4 extremely similar and dull themes for 12 horse racing tracks, none of which feel at home in terms of the Mario Universe. No special items like shells or fire flower either. And the unlockable characters, OH GOD! You won't bring back Neil and Ella from Advance Tour or have some random inclusions like Petey Pirahna, King Boo, or anyone from WarioWare, Nintendo? But you will include Metal Mario and PINK GOLD PEACH!?! So, why isn't this game awful and just average to me? Well, that's just it. It's not Super Mario standard, but the gameplay is solid. I especially like the pitching mechanics in baseball and taking care of horses in your stable. If anything, I think horse racing would make a great standalone title if they had interactions between Mario characters and the horse and expanded on everything else in the mode, including item variety, track themes, and customization. It just feels like Mario Sports Superstars should have been the start of a new franchise or even just a new subseries in the Mario universe with either forgotten or entirely brand new characters and just some Mario classics like Luigi, Daisy, Waluigi, etc. being unlockable bonuses. At least then, despite still being of average quality, it could than be looked at in an standalone context and then improved upon for an Nintendo Switch sequel. Instead, because of the Mario Sports stigma attached to it and lack of creativity to help back it, it ends up alongside more recent Mario and Sonic Olympic titles and general Nintendo spinoffs as a fun diversion for fans and newcomers. But one that will probably be forgotten and forsaken by said players who will probably replay older, much larger standout Mario sports titles instead.",3,1,0,474,2187,75,738,24,11,55.07,10.48,9.83,14.23

EA has been the staple in sports games and its about time that they got their hands on this sport. The one thing I would say that has a few things to fix is the submission engine.

"Next Gen fighter is here, with EA's UFC. This game has a new feel to it, when it comes to the previous UFC titles. It feel's like a hybrid of EA's MMA and and normal UFC game. It takes a little time to get use to the controls, but once you do it's on. This game tries really hard to make it feel realistic, and does a great job. You need to think game plan when fighting, coming out swing may land you a big hit, but if it doesn't, you're done son. Trying to button smash in this game, will empty your character's gas tank fast, leaving you to the wolves. You have to keep your health and stamina on your mind at all times during the fight. Let a limb get hurt too much, and you'll be finished off, or can't punch/kick as well. The new career mode had you fighting for the Ultimate Fighter title, as you work your way into the UFC.

Sure, some guys can do this in real life, but basically every guy in the game has these flashy abilities.

"Metroid 2: Return of Samus is a frustrating timesink that can feel hardly worth the effort you put in. Now Metroid: Samus Returns is a fantastic game that sets the standard for 'remastered' games. The first breath of fresh air Samus Returns introduces is the counter-attack mechanic, which lets you manage fights and your speed. Then the first Aeion ability you're given is Scan Pulse, which reveals most secrets within a certain distance, removing the need for guessing which blocks are destructable. Just as with the original, how you go about exploring is mostly up to you. The map helps tremendously with this, as well as the hints from the Chozo seals. You'll *almost* never feel lost. Only once did I really feel lost, and it was during a specific boss fight (which I feel could've been designed better). Now, the downsides. While the counter-attack mechanic is nice, it also gets fairly stale, fast. Although, this is mostly due to the lack of variety in enemies and having to backtrack through them. The controls a great, but they're locked in. That means no adjusting your key configs for the physical buttons or the touchscreen controls. The touchscreen buttons would've been great to rearrange because some of them are in such awkward positions. Whether you have big, small, or the perfect hands for the 3DS, unless you're fine taking your time to select things, you'll find yourself thinking the same thing. Overall, Samus Returns is a great addition to the Metroid series, with very minor issues. The perfect thing to sit on while you wait for Prime 4.",4,1,0,276,1248,24,393,17,8,69.89,7.54,8.96,9.97
"I am a long-time fan of Nintendo Games, and of Metroid in particular. Metroid has always been a series I've regarded with a great fondness. Super Metroid was one of the first games I was truly enamored with, even before Mario and Zelda. This title is a remake of the second entry in the series, Metroid II: Return of Samus, which appeared on the original Gameboy. I have only played a little of the original myself, and therefore cannot go in-depth into the updates in the Remake, aside from improvements that have become standard since the time of the original release. The gameplay shares the style of side-scrolling Metroid titles like Super Metroid and Fusion. Abilities such as the Spider-ball make their re-debut, and abilities like Wall-jump and Edge grab are present as well. Four new abilities, called Aeion abilites, reveal a portion of the map, offer damage protection, rapid-fire, and slow-down time. They are powered by an Aeion meter, and are unlocked a certain points in the game. The premise of the story, which I'll get to, is that Samus is hunting-down and exterminating the Metroid population. As such there is a certain amount of repetition. The development team did a good job of making the level design varied, and the gradual progression into more challenging Metroids satisfying. Still, most Metroid fights aren't all that unique. Also many of the standard enemies in later levels are upgraded versions of those present in earlier levels. Even so, I personally found there to be enough variety to avoid making the game a slog to the end. Difficulty-wise, this game isn't punishing, but it isn't easy either. Newer players will likely struggle, even with helpful abilities enabled. When the next level of Metroid is introduced, fighting it can be a pretty decent challenge. By the time you're pretty used to that kind of Metroid, a more powerful one is introduced. The Omega Metroid was epic to fight, and a joy to defeat. There are also a few boss fights that are pleasing, if occasionally frustrating, challenges. I also greatly enjoyed the final boss, and found it to be quite difficult. A gaming savant might find it easy or moderately challenging. An unskilled gamer would likely find it impossible. Overall, I found the challenge to be slightly more than what I would find in most other games. Story-wise, there isn't much there explicitly. Lore exists outside the game, such as the origin of Metroids, or the Chozo, but it isn't delved into. Veterans of the series will definitely notice nods to other titles, and easily see where this game falls between the original Metroid, and Super Metroid. Newcomers may be lost entirely to the narrative, or the significance of certain events or enemies. What this game accomplishes is a sense of solitude. A lone huntress charging in headfirst into a danger-filled world. The story, in that sense, is more experienced than told. Much can be, and has been, extrapolated from the series as a whole, for those who are interested. For average gamers, I encourage you to simply play the game, and enjoy it for what it is upfront. Overall, I think this game appeals more to experienced gamers than newcomers. While the difficulty curve isn't extreme for newcomers, this wouldn't be the first game I'd give them to play. As a game, it is mechanically solid, and is a blast to play. It is more centered around an experience than a narrative, which may be a turn-off for some. However, I think most gamers will enjoy it, and especially fans of the Metroid series.",5,1,0,626,2811,78,967,39,8,59.86,8.9,8.76,11.4
"Finally we get a real Metroid game! Metroid Samus Returns is a remake of Metroid 2 which only appeared on the game boy. The remake is awesome and plays fantastic. The remake expands and makes the game better in alot of ways by adding more to explore and making it less linear than the original game. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the new melee attack. Enemies will often flash signaling that they are going to rush you and you can counter them with a melee. Usually if successful you will kill the enemy (if its not a boss) with one shot of your beam after a counter. I feel this really changes how the game is played and I didn't like it as much. Some of you might like the melee counter alot, but for me it didn't click. However, it isn't enough to bring the game down since the game is still fun.",4,1,0,162,631,14,221,10,6,74.98,6.83,5.28,9.94
"Everything is on full aggro so you have to stop and use the counter mechanic every half second... It lost all its charm cause you used it too often. Exploration is disappointing in that there's too much boring dead space and monotonous ball maze detour puzzles. There's also unnecessary segmented abilities that takes you out of your control comfort that get scattered usage but ultimately feels very lame and uninspired. The only redeeming thing about this game is that it allowed you to free aim, which adds a neat layer, but it never gets utilization on puzzling. Overall mediocre experience, the design and setting is pretty disappointing. Reused tracks for lava area was also a dumb lazy move.",2,0,1,120,567,17,197,7,10,50.55,10.47,10.26,12.52

However completing challenges unlocks more worlds. *You can download and play levels created from the Wii U version Cons: *You can't use amiibos *You can't upload your own levels via internet, instead you have to use street pass or download with friends who have the game.

The one thing that this game has on the Wii U version is there are 100 premade levels to play through, and with two challenges per level, there's a lot to play through. As a Mario Maker game, it fails, but since it's a Select title which makes it cheaper, it's not a bad value to get it just for the levels.

The writing and voice acting of the characters are both believable and relatable. Although the story draws you in, the actual gameplay becomes tedious and boring after a while. The mechanics of the game are nothing new and a bit old school. The player has to continuously pick up ammo. This might not sound like a big deal, but after hours of playing it is quite tedious. Lastly, I would say that the game takes around 10-12 hours to beat. There is no multilayer for this game so one really needs to assert if the game is worth buying $60.

I'm not to sure why these people are complaining about gameplay as well as physics of the game I do however agree the 'DOOM' beta trial is a load of well cant say on here but you catch my drift. Maybe the ones that complained about this game play should go back to playing camp of duty and battlefield 'three/four' <==. Which just saying neither of them ever changes Wolfenstein: the new order on the other hand did change for better where as the older Wolfenstein games lacked in physics of in game play although the stories were ok and the online was just pure terror in the older Wolfenstein games this game has a great story it is somewhat of a bummer there is no online but the story makes up for it if you don't like playing campaigns this isn't for you the graphics are amazing unlike call of duty's... which has no grit war games are supposed to be brutal guns blazing not sit in a corner camp wait for enemy's to come to you this game has it all I recommend to anyone who truly likes these types of games.",5,5,0,229,936,17,310,5,21,45.82,18.25,7.59,21.29
"This game is, by its definition, a standard shooter. The mechanics are all similar to other FPS games, so if you are used to this type of game, them you will feel right at home. This, however, helps you focus less on the mechanics themselves and allows you to pay attention to the plot, which is actually interesting (after the intro, that is). You have to get through an over-the-top set piece before you see what I am talking about story wise. It is believable within context and you can relate to the characters feelings and emotions. At least, that's how I would feel if things panned out like they do in the game. Buy this game for the story and nothing else. If your looking for a fun shooter, there is one to be had here, but there is no multiplayer. However, an interesting decision early on in the game encourages to do two playthroughs, but I won't spoil the fun. Dual wielding the gun is fun at first, but then it becomes cumbersome with too many enemies on screen, since it is less accurate and more clunky. I, instead, found it more satisfying to go for stealth kills. I do like having both options at hand. Minor issues with AI not recognizing you on rare occasion, but in those cases, it usually works to your advantage. Overall, I would rate the game a 7 out of ten, which is not a bad rating. Buy it, play it, and then, take advantage of the Best Buy return program so that you can invest in another game. You will have fun with this one.",4,5,1,278,1136,27,382,16,7,72.95,7.4,6.52,10.83

"Wolfenstein: The New Order is the first game developed by MachineGames, a new game development studio comprised of industry veterans who worked on such titles as The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness. After leaving Starbreeze, these talents started MachineGames to continue their passion of making great games, and if Wolfenstein: The New Order is any indication, this studio has a bright future ahead of them. First and foremost, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a single player game. Is that a negative? Not one bit. There are enough multiplayer games out there if that's what you're into, and only a few of them actually succeed, so it's best to leave multiplayer to the games that have people who want that and not waste resources on it when they could be better spent making a meatier and more satisfying single player game, and that's exactly what MachineGames did with Wolfenstein: The New Order. Depending on your style of play, you can get 20 hours out of this game on one playthrough, which is very long for a first-person shooter. In addition, both running & gunning and stealth are viable options since the level design allows for exploration and planning which is important if you're play stealthily. This also adds replay since here are two different ways you can play the game. As for the shooting, it's so buttery smooth and packs a punch. I haven't played a shooter in a very long time that felt this good. As for stealth, it's pretty basic but satisfying. It's fun throwing knives at the enemy or using a silenced pistol. :) Onto the graphics, this game is available on Xbox One, PS4, PC, Xbox 360 and PS3, so it's a cross-generational release, which means it won't be the most graphically impressive game you've ever seen. Sometimes it looks outstanding, sometimes it looks okay, and other times you'll notice that some textures aren't as detailed as they could be. With that said, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a rarity on consoles like Xbox One and PS4 since it outputs native 1080p resolution and 60 frames-per-second on both. Now the big surprise for me is the story. Wolfenstein was never known for story, but The New Order changes that. Likable protagonists, despised antagonists, all wonderfully voiced and acted. In addition, the soundtrack is tops. Wolfenstein: The New Order surprised me by how good it is. Probably my favorite FPS since Half-Life 2.",5,2,0,427,1920,56,639,22,10,60.53,9.64,9.11,13.01

"SPOILERS I'm a fan of anything Wolfenstein/DOOM/Quake. So I was excited about this release, especially on Xbox One. I have to say I was a little disappointed. The game is not bad, just not as good as it could've been. For starters, this is an FPS - from one of the franchises that pioneered the FPS. So you expect firefights, gun battles and the like. Sadly, this game promotes, sometimes forces, you to sneak around with a knife. It also forces you to rely heavily on a laser cutter. Not the kind of FPS experience that I was hoping for. There's also no multiplayer or coop. In all fairness, the laser cutter doubles as a very cool laser shooter - though with limited capacity. All of the weapons are a lot of fun to shoot, when you do get to use them. I wish there was a 'BFG' somewhere. I really miss having a weapon that will lay waste to everything with one shot. The variety of weapons is nice, as is the dual wielding for some. There are some rare opportunities to fire larger artillery weapons, but it's done sparingly which was a little disappointing #one sequence takes you to a cutscene when you pull the trigger, kinda lame#. The story is nothing spectacular. The 'bad germans' won WWII and are the ruling class of Europe. You join forces with a group of resistance fighters in Berlin and lead the charge to take down Deathshead. The dialog is a little cheesy and there are a few too many cutscenes for my taste - some that you can't skip. The ending is very predictable. There are actually two slightly different storylines, depending on how you play the game. The enemy AIs make for fun, challenging targets. The bosses are also pretty cool, but the actual battles were a little boring. There's a VERY cool throwback to old school Wolfenstein within the game #hint: take a nap on the top floor bed when you get to the safehouse#. The graphics on Xb1 are very clean/clear with no frame rate issues that I could see. The unlockables aren't all that great #I thought unlockable concept art died out in first gen console games??#. I did enjoy this game, though it fell short in a few aspects. I plan to keep it and play through a couple more times.",3,1,0,403,1692,40,575,30,6,72.49,6.49,6.68,9.34
"I was pleasantly surprised by Wolfenstein: New Order. The Alternate Reality/History angle with the German's winning WWII was truly unique and made for a fantastic backdrop for an otherwise modern shooter. Gameplay was fast and fluid with little to complain about. The option to go in guns blazing OR stealthy varied the campaign considerably. There is no multi-player for those asking/looking. I did not miss it, as I was looking for a meaty single player campaign and Wolfenstein: New Order delivers it in spades.",5,1,0,88,418,11,142,6,9,55.43,9.17,10.11,10.87
"Wolfenstein was the (first) First Person Shooter I ever played (like many others) way back in 1993 when I was just 9 Years old and I will never forget that. I played the Ravensoft release in 2009 and found that to be quite a sleeper hit and very enjoyable. This latest game was made by MachineGames in Sweden and does not disappoint. Solid controls, great weapons and excellent memorable character designs. It's just long enough, not too short and not drawn out. If you want a new FPS on Xbox One definitely give this a go, you will not regret it. It's a game that was definitely made for the fans but did not alienate any will be new players at the same time. Highly recommended.",5,1,0,128,538,12,180,8,7,71.63,7.24,7.06,10.15
"Wolfenstein: The New Order is a fantastic game overall and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good shooter with a great story. The AI can be mindless at times but it doesn't really take away from the action or story.",5,1,0,46,185,6,66,2,10,62.11,10.31,6.56,14.42
"This game is really fun and engaging with lots of puzzles as well as good FPS action but sometimes it's frustrating trying to figure out how to get past some boss fights with little to no hints so you die a lot and try again, die and try again, die and try again... Get the point? But, this is not always bad as sometimes you discover things you missed after the first or second death. But like all ALL FPS's I've played, there is no real replacement for peripheral vision and this game fails at this but it's in a big club. Also, there are some surround sound issues, so don't rely on shots coming at you they may be behind you but the sound is coming from everywhere. Also, this is NOT for Children! There are Adult scenes (Rated=R)! And blood so parents, pay attention to the 'M' rating. Multiplayer would have been a great addition! Too bad it's missing.",4,1,0,168,667,10,218,10,6,80,6.27,5.78,9.1
"I am a big fan of the old Wolfenstein 3d from the early 90's and always wished for a reboot that would do the title justice. The attempts over the years have fallen far short. With this newest installment it has come very close to restoring the name. This game has a lot of action and has great story telling. I enjoyed that it modified history to bring a fresh spin on how the world could have ended up. The gameplay is very good but sometimes the difficulty seems to range too much throughout the game. I played it through on the second to last difficulty so some spots were decently difficult (just right) but then it would get too easy in certain areas then become absolutely unforgiving in others. Overall, even though the game is a bit short for a game with no multiplayer offering (about 10 - 12 hours) I would recommend this game as it is worth at least one play through.",4,1,0,165,700,16,227,8,9,69.51,8.69,7.71,12.13
"A smooth shooter with great graphics and cool weapons to tear apart your enemies with. Too bad that so far there's no plans to release a multiplayer or co-op mode add-on for this game. Still worth playing though.",4,1,0,41,169,2,52,3,5,85.67,4.71,6.27,7.42
"With the lack of great next gen games, I picked up Wolfenstein with the great Best Buy Gamers Unlocked deal. Regardless, the game was mindless fun. It was a solid First Person Shooter with an OK story. However, the game lacks any multiplayer, so once you finish it I don't see myself playing it again. There are lots of unlockables and things to find if you are into that stuff. There are also two story lines, so you can play twice if you care about both stories. Overall, it was decent. For the price I paid I recommend it. MSRP, not so much.",4,1,0,104,425,7,138,9,4,82.85,4.57,5.67,7.31
"i was not sure to buy this game because it didn't have any online multiplayer but after watching some youtube let's plays i decided i couldn't resist. I am glad i bought it. The story is very long and you will need to play it more than once to get all the collectibles and save different people. The action is great in this game. I couldn't really stop playing it till i beat it. Graphics are good and sound quality is good. You can also choose to do stealthy kills or go in guns blazing. It's up to your preference how you play it. Also you get rewarded by a perk system for doing things like stealth kills, throwing knife kills, dual wield kills etc. Overall i would give an 8 out of 10. only because of no multiplayer.",5,1,0,144,565,11,189,11,4,82.51,5,5.01,8.29

It starts off during the final days of World War 2 & then jumps to 1960s. The Germans have won World War 2 & have taken over the world. It is your job to take it back from them.

"Having only just started playing this game, I haven't seen very much, but the stuff I have seen I am enjoying. The city is oppressive and gloomy, painting a portrait of a city being destroyed by plague and corruption. With all the twists and turns and various paths it's easy to get lost in feeling of this game. The negative is that the real challenge is to get through the levels without touching any NPC. No killing, no knockouts, no suspicions raised. As with most stealth heavy games, guards patrol a set pattern, always turning the same direction and pausing for the same amount of time. This is my biggest frustration with these games. With these new systems, AI should be more random, more lifelike. Give me consequences to taking out the guards. If you were a guard talking to your buddy, and all of a sudden he disappears when you turn your back, would you be concerned? At any rate, this game is a great play and makes me excited to see what the future holds for the new consoles.",4,3,0,183,786,13,251,11,8,73.91,7.08,7.68,9.5
"I got this initially thinking it would be something similar to the Assassins Creed series, which it started out as.

"There is a plague about the world. It's a dark setting in a sparsly populated city. Curfew is in effect. You'll progress at a snails pace but this is a game about stealth! You aren't going to buy this title for instant gratification. Finding the hidden treasures is the name of the game. Hidden is the keyword here. Prepare for hours of study in the ancient shadow arts. Mr. Thief is a master of his art. He transverses the environment with smoothness and fluidity. You have skills that can be upgraded such as stealth, combat, and efficiency. There are benefits to the skills but loot is scarce. You'll have to manage your resources carefully. Buying arrows and tools may be more important. Careful planning will get you through your endeavors. Just keep focussed with focus. The controls are great. Everything works. You'll slide through the environment like biscuits through molasses. The world is detailed with several hidden areas. There is a story being told every time you complete a chapter. The world is dynamic with new areas opening as you complete events. The story transitions in real time. Events take place in the world and you experience them. There are tools and weapons. You have your bow and an assortment of arrows ranging from offensive to defensive and some unique environmental modifying catalysts. The blackjack is your other weapon for infighting. You'll be able to dodge most attacks but everything about the combat is upgradable. Replay value depends on your preferences. People still replay linear games. Look up speed runs. If you turn off all the assists and can still finish the game on the hardest difficulty finding all the loot in less than a few hours, then you've probably conquered this title. No game is perfect. Because a perfect game is boring. Technology-wise, I think everyone believes this game should be maintaining a solid 60 frames per second. Graphics and technology in general won't make a great game. BlueRay movies show at about 24 frames per second. Too fast and you get the live TV effect. Residents are robotic with 3 lines of scripted communication. It repeats redundantly. Nothing new here, developers don't spend time designing clones that carry on conversation. The attention to detail is notable but it leaves you wishing you could be able to interact with more of the environment. Throwing buckets and candles at guards instead of being limited to bottles. Thievery is the name of this game. You get instant money for larceny but it would have been better to have had to haggle with the Fence. Sale a couple of valued items and receive a better price. The system works irregardless (it's a word). Play the game but don't believe the reviews until you've experienced it for yourself. I don't personally care for popular reviewers on video sites because they never truly play a game. They'll tell you 7 to 10 hours but I've already sank approximately 30 hours into this game.

"I've been playing this game series since the first season came out. I really recommend this game to anyone. It's not based on the TV series. It has different characters who face survival and personal problems throughout the whole game. There are emetional and sad decisions you have to make for the group so keep that in mind. This game is not a 1st person shooter or any of that stuff. It's just a story interaction game which basically you make the decisions of what to say or do of the main character.

"Captures the feel Iga's older Castlevania platforming adventures with a great retro soundtrack. One casual playthrough isn't too long, but additional difficulties up the challenge and replay value. Plus, there are many secrets in the walls! Four characters to play and switch between, each with their own ability, allow you to mix (and combine) powers. It's a premium price to pay for this physical release of a $10 download, but if you are a fan and backer of the new Bloodstained game (or Castlevania fan), it is a must have for the collection. Besides the Nintendo Switch cartridge, you get a case and little character manual with it. I wish the manual would have included control instructions, like game manuals back in the day, but it is really just a character introduction manual with artwork. Fairly light manual, at with only five spreads. This is created with the diehard fan in mind, so, being a diehard fan, my review is skewed to 5. But then, if you aren't a fan, why would you be reading all of this? I included images for clarity on what is included.

"What an amazing & nostalgic experience! Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon takes you back in time to the NES days, to the days of Castlevania 1 & 3. A platformer that plays very much like Castlevania, with a few new more modern twists. This game is basically a reimagining of Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse... where you can play up to 4 characters. A Swordsman, an Alchemist/Mage, Long range & high jumping woman with a whip & a Vampire/Dark Magic user type of character with the ability to fly long stretches... all characters with different attack patterns, sub weapons, strengths & weaknesses. Game takes you through 8 levels, with diverting paths filled with peril or just plain shortcuts. Each playthru can feel like a fresh experience! Game features multiple endings, 3 modes & a Boss Rush mode that is unlockable. Game is all about experimenting and pattern recognition like the old NES days... and the game provides quite the challenge for those that decide to tackle the Veteran mode difficulty playstyle and for those that want to have an easier time, the game provides with a 'Casual' mode difficulty. Getting a physical copy of this game with as much replayability it had, was the definitely worth the extra $20 in its price tag, quite the collector's item from Limited Run Games' partnership with Best Buy. 5/5 game with countless of hours to sink in for all the different playthroughs and endings to acquire & see.",5,1,0,242,1133,38,370,14,10,59.94,9.19,10.02,13.2

There's still some bugs to be patched out, and the open world feels a little simplistic compared to the Saints Row games, but I've got around 40 hours into it and I'm still loving it.

"For anyone who hasn't played these titles it is a FPS with puzzle elements that you can either blast your way through or sneak through. I always tend to play any game that gives options in a barbaric, kill them all, even the civilians manner. this game, unlike many others makes that extremely challenging. the AI is extremely smart and will go around different object, or shoot through things to hit you. running away is an option, except they tend to surround you and they will follow you across the map. Speaking of the map, it is a little quirky and the quest icons can be a little annoying at first, but you get used to it quickly. Good variety of weapons and the augmentations are always fun. There is a bit of a learning curve if new to this game, but all in all it is fantastic to play and gives you good replayability since you can go through all stealth (including talking your way out of boss fights), blast your way through, or a combination of both.

"Games like this now a days aren't worth the $60 they charge this game does a fairly good job of keeping you entertained. For example there are multiple endings that are based on what you do or don't do. I played the entire game twice through and had 2 different results. So of those side missions are only activated by roaming around talking or doing particular things. The news reporter at the end of the game will makes remakes based on those choices. Cons are few. One is once you unlock enough parts of your tech the game doesn't challenge you. Even on the harder difficulty the catch is you have to be mindful about which ones you choose. But by 70% of the way through the game if you also completed enough side mission you will almost be unstoppable. My first time completed i was 90% through all the upgrades I could purchase. The game is only really hard if you make it hard if your a stealthy and patience you could beat the game on any difficulty without being killed There are minor unpolished things like when you drag enemies into a corner or throw them so they can't be detected they have no smoothness to it they don't drag or drop like a body should things like that but over all its good being that you choose the outcome and how people talk to you is based on what you already know or you could go into a conversation and not get any clues because you didn't do x,y or z makes it fun",4,1,0,274,1115,20,364,11,11,69.16,9.8,6.94,12.88

Would definitely recommend.",4,1,0,64,287,10,103,5,7,57.69,8.39,8.26,11.37
"Im a fan of survival horror. While the genre had, for a while, made a shift from inventory management and survival to a surplus of ammo with a focus on action, things are starting to look up with games like Outlast and the latest entry in the Resident Evil franchise. Evil Within 2 manages to create a nice bridge between survival and action by giving players a solid arsenal with just enough ammo to get yourself into trouble. Frame this in a broken world of connected minds, and youve got a satisfying recipe for trippy and grotesque psychological survival horror. The Evil Within 2 is a perfect example of what survival horror should be. The weapons youre provided throughout the campaign help to keep you from feeling entirely powerless, while enticing you to be more courageous than you really should be. Ammo is extremely scarce and you may find yourself using more than you should on standard enemies instead of saving it up for boss fights. This can create a steep spike in the games difficulty, but that really comes down to bad planning. Inventory and resource management are a huge part of what makes this game successful as a survival horror game. You have the option to blast your enemies to oblivion and feel powerful, but that road tends to lead to an abrupt end in your power fantasy as the games challenging boss fights will leave you begging for mercy if unprepared. The Evil Within 2 knows exactly what it is and doesn't try so much to be an emulation of something successful as much as it is an evolution or refinement of what makes the genre so great. Despite the action and RPG elements, the game never makes you feel powerful. You're constantly going into a big fight with just enough in your inventory to make it by (provided you have the skill to survive - I did not. I died over 100 times over the course of my first playthrough on Nightmare). The marriage of concepts from Resident Evil and Silent Hill makes for a near perfect survival horror game that hearkens back to the past of the genre while driving it in new directions that haven't really been seen since Silent Hill 2 and RE4. There's a constant, looming dread of unpreparedness, incentive to avoid conflict instead of just killing everything in front of you. That paired with a story that's as absurd as it is intriguing and emotionally captivating makes for a truly remarkable gaming experience.",5,1,0,426,1928,58,652,17,13,51.92,12.24,9.63,15.47

"The gameplay of this title is not like the first one. There are several open world sections and the game is not scary. While the keys and upgrading different characteristics can be fun, I feel that overall the experience is underwhelming. The game is not directed by the legend in gaming who directed the original the evil within and it definitely shows. This title is not scary at all. The tense battles of the original are replaced by very average boss fights. The director on this one spent too much times trying to develop a story that, quite frankly, seems to be 2 separate stories rolled into one game. Overall, I was quite disappointed in this title. While I played the original multiple times over the past 3 years, I beat this one within a week and will be returning it shortly. I would even say that the gaming mechanics take a step back in some areas. The game is still fun, but its nowhere near the caliber of the original.",3,0,1,171,748,25,257,11,7,63.91,8.21,8.02,12.07

"Last time I purchased a hockey game, I felt a little overwhelmed by the controls. At 40+ years of age, I don't have the time I used to to put into games so I wanted to go with old school controls I was semi-familiar with. So getting this and going with the '94 control scheme (one button for shoot / one for pass / one for deke), I hoped that would be cool. Well, not as cool as it used to be but I'm still winning. Having said that, I do feel WAY limited and am playing on semi-pro. About to up the difficulty to normal and see how I do. Again, you're limited compared to regular controls. Also, FYI, if you're into customizing your team -- like I did my expansion franchise Houston Aeros -- there are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYY too many things to change. It's cool to be able to change so much but pretty tedious. Haven't delved into other modes.",4,1,0,165,645,10,223,10,6,75.75,6.79,5.39,9.02

The gameplay is better than ever. With 2k18, you needed to adjust the sliders to make the game play great. 2K19 plays perfectly out of the box. There are a few areas that can be tweaked but they are very minor. The MY Team does make you play some online games to unlock features that you will want to have. I HATE that. I hate being forced to play online, and win, to open features. I understand they want us to try out stuff, but adding the Must Win caveat really makes me hate the mode before i even try it. Bad move, 2K. There is so much to do in the game that it can be overwhelming a bit. The learning curve can be a little steep, but it is well worth a little effort.

"Are you ready to party like it's 2004? Then Kingdom Hearts III might be the game for you. I'll admit that I'm not a die-hard fan of the series but have always sort of admired it from afar, then never given it a whole lot of attention. I'm a huge JRPG fan, a huge Square fan, and even a huge Disney fan, but ultimately this game does nothing for me. It looks absolutely stunning on Xbox One X and presumably almost as good on stock Xbox One but the game feels way too much like a PS2 title to be enjoyable in this day and age. You could have told me it was a 4K remaster of a 15 year old game and I'd have believed you. That said, if you're a fan of the series anyway and want to see how it all comes together, go for it. Sometimes that nagging itch of wanting to know the end of a story makes the suffering worthwhile. That wasn't the case for me.",2,2,0,180,653,10,225,9,6,80.79,6.96,4.05,10.22

"Great game! I have been a fan of the KH series since I first played it when I was 7, this is just one more great addition. The combat has been upped (you can now swap between 3 different keyblades mid fight and each keyblade has a special second form/finisher), the worlds are huge, and the game play is fun/ addictive and easy to get the hang of. Nevertheless, unless you want to be confused, I wouldn't recommend this to newcomers without first beefing up on the old lore or playing the old games; because they reference a lot from the previous games with little context. They've lowered the difficulty since KH 2, (save the very final sections of the game) and unless you go on proud mode its downright easy, but it still is wildly entertaining either way. And to anyone who think the graphics are short of great (okay, I believe you), nah man; this thing is beautiful. Some of the animated sections looked on par if not better than their Disney counterparts and the pirates world was weirdly enjoyable (water combat no longer makes me want to kill myself). So I highly recommend this game if you've played all the others. Also, just a heads up, buy at least one potion/ingredient from every moogle you see. He'll give you a postcard after every first purchase and you need a butt-ton of postcards to get Orichalcum+ (needed for the strongest keyblade).",5,1,0,250,1072,22,350,10,12,63.02,10.68,8.23,13.52

"First off, I haven't played any of the kingdom hearts games up until this point, so consider that for my review. This game had the hype. My friends who were big kingdom heart fans had been talking fervently about this game for a year. Every month and week leading up to release I would get some breathless update on how this game is gonna be the best thing since sliced bread... So I bought the game on release. The reviews were good. And I had done my homework into the story line (there are many synopses online). But wow was I disappointed. The combat by itself is largely boring to actually do. You hit the same button repeatedly with the same combo, over and over and over and over again. Yes, the developers do spice up stuff by having these amusement ride combos cash-ins, and that's cool. But having just come from God of War, the combat mechanics in this game are a tier below. So I'm left with just a meh feeling. Writing and story. So everyone knows the writing is... Just weird. I'm not super invested in these characters, but I could see if you're a lifetime fan of the series, the character interactions might have some more weight for you. But as someone with no prior experience, the character interactions were awkward at best and dumbfounding at worst. I don't know if I should blame the translator, or the writer, so I'll blame both. Story is infamously convoluted, and I'll say it rings true here as well. All around, I would not say this game is worth full price of admission. $30 seems like a fair deal if you're just looking for a JRPG and don't have any experience with this game series.",3,2,3,307,1263,24,419,22,5,77.21,5.96,6.27,8.71

"Ive been anticipating Kingdom Hearts 3s release since I finished Kingdom Hearts 2 in 2006. Actually, though, Kingdom Hearts 3 is the 13th game in the series - preceded by such titles as 358/2 Days (Three Five Eight Days Over Two) and Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -a fragmentary passage-. The storyline for the series is about as incomprehensible as the titles, with time travel and alternate realities and clones. To tell the truth, if you dont already have the game, you probably wont care about it at all. Which is a shame, because this is the most Kingdom Hearts-y game ever. Each previous game added or changed a game mechanic, and this game brings them all together. There is almost too much to do while in combat, with every flashy attack flowing into the next. One of the most striking aspects of the game is the graphics, especially on the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro. Specifically, when youre with Buzz and Woody from Toy Story, or Rapunzel and Flynn from Tangled, the characters and environments look as good - sometimes even better - than the movies they come from. Its remarkable, and really shows off how far weve come. The writing isnt the best, but the voice acting performances are solid, led by Haley Joel Osment playing the main character, Sora, as he has since the first game. It is funny, sometimes, having characters like Goofy talk about finding a heart in the datascape, or Mickey Mouse in a black cloak threatening monsters with a sword, but thats really what Kingdom Hearts is all about.",4,1,2,268,1202,27,395,13,11,61.22,9.84,9.14,12.28

Im playing on Xbox One X and it fluctuates between 50 and 60fps. Now does hinder the experience? No but I would like them to address for the future. But overall its fun the gameplay is good plus it has one of the best soundtracks Ive heard in a very long time and the story is not bad from what I can understand anyways haha.

"Took me a while to complete this game's story mode, but it was definitely long and worthwhile just to see how the story played out. The gameplay was definitely fun the longer you stayed with the game and learned how its new mechanics work. Speed Cards is introduced as your new system for upgrading your ride beyond its natural limitations, which kind of keeps you coming back in hopes to being ready for the next big event. Sometimes you have to replay events to earn enough to get to the next big thing, but it's not a constant thing if you are frugal early on with base shipments and earned rewards. For a smooth gameplay style, I recommend you save all of your Speed Cards until you really need them. Don't sale the ones you don't want; store them to invest in rolling three unused ones for a chance to score a really powerful one later on as you progress through the game with your car of choice. Save up all of your money to get that dream car you always wanted (mine was the Jaguar F-Type R). The only downside to this game, when compared to the likes of Hot Pursuit, is that the cop chases are either very difficult to get past later on in the game and that they just end automatically after you get toward your final checkpoint. It's nowhere near as good as it was when you actually had to work hard and think creatively at dispatching them in previous games. The game is split up between Race, Drift, Drag, Off-Road, and Runner (Cop Chase) events. You'll most likely spend most of your time as a racer and doing off-road events because those two are the most challenging as you get deeper into the game. (Off-Road is particularly unfair on certain difficulty settings.) There are a million little distractions to do in the open-world of this desert city, so go out and explore, find derelicts, and save up for your dream car. Then go online and challenge the world with your unique ride.",3,1,0,359,1505,26,488,14,12,65.81,10.45,7.7,13.15

If im doing illegal driving I expect to get reported and chased. It does not happen at all in free roam. Customization in this game is good. EA took an extra year of dev time to make this and it shows no effort. I cant recommend people buying this game to be honest.",3,2,0,118,478,5,156,11,4,84.1,4.19,5.26,5.99

"Here are my impressions regarding this game: Pros: I liked the addition of over new 100 Digimon to the game (300+ in total). It was nice to see what the side characters were up to when you did not see them in the first game. The story was good overall. It was a pain to get the pre-order bonus but once I received it via email, it filled up my Field Guide and I got a couple costumes. Cons: You must have played the previous game in order to understand this game. The story felt disjointed at times because the main character from the previous game impacted your story. Not much was improved design wise so if you were not familiar with the layout, you are bound to go through a learning curve. You will have to do a ton of level grinding if you plan on completing your Field Guide. You do not get a choice of gender for your protagonist, but it is about one person after all. On a final note, you have to pay for the DLC in this game, versus the previous game which was free. Overall, it was a good game. I have considered going back and forth between this game and the previous game to see if I would get a fuller story. I highly recommend this game if you have played the previous one in the series.",4,3,1,236,942,22,311,13,7,76.92,7.04,6.04,10.99

Then I found out, you can only play as the male character and the female character you see on the cover art, is just a skin you can choose to use while only online. Its like theyre going backwards. Why have your first game have the ability to choose between a male and female character, but not your second one? And also advertise it as if you have the option to choose.

"I am a huge fan of the zombie genre, and thoroughly enjoy a good zombie game! I have played through the Left For Dead Series and loved it, so going in to Dead Island, I already had something to base the experience off of. I like the first person perspective quite a bit, and the controls and action is very satisfying! The story line and quests change up enough to keep me interested, and the open world concept is a big plus! The down side. First, the action is great except they forgot to make you and the other zombies solid objects. For instance, if a zombie rushes you and you miss with your attack, they don't stay in front of you, they run right through you, and now you have a zombie behind you. And you can run through them as well. This can be hugely irritating when fighting a horde of zombies because if you back yourself into a narrow alleyway to fight a bunch of them, the ones you miss end up behind you, and the bottleneck you intended to use as a defense is a detriment, not a help. Secondly, I don't mind blood and violence, but this trend that everything has to have cussing and cleavage to make it interesting or realistic is false. Every woman on the island is a scantly clad model in a bikini, and the language gets old... I'm a grown adult, and would enjoy playing action games even more without adult content. It seems like it would be an easy option to add to the Sound Menu. Toggle adult language on/off. Overall, it's a fun game.

The My Player career mode is still not fun at all, and now you have to run around in a laggy arena in order to go through it. Also, most of the moves, clothing, accessories, etc are locked inside loot boxes. Not cool. At least you dont have to pay real money for them, but still a pain.

While this game is not on the same level as Lego City Undercover it is still a fun game to play with fun challenges. It follows the story of the movie so DO NOT play this game until you have seen the movie.

"I was able to play this game at E3 2015. I'm sure the final version will have minor differences but I will share my experience with the game. For Honor is very much a cooperative effort with your four teammates. You will have a tough time if you try to go '5150' on your team members and take down the enemy on your own. During my match I played on the defenders as the second defender. There were three bases A, B and C that we were trying to take a hold of. The goal was to get to 1,000 points to make your enemy army feel defeated and give them the finale blow before winning the battle. From my experience, you earn points the more bases you take over. My defender teammates would call out bases they intended to take over or defend. You and your teammates can team up on an opponent, but it will leave you vulnerable. If no one is there to defend your base, another team can run to it and claim it. Similar to capture the flag type games. There are also perks you earn as you kill off your enemies. You can head over to your fellow soldiers and inspire them as a perk, heal yourself or kill a bunch of your enemies by using a catapult. You do have the option to customize your character. There were different armor options and you can choose between playing as a male or female. There is no statistical benefit from playing as a male versus a female. They are equal matches. I choose to play as a male. I didnt have much time to look through the armor options, but there were at least four I was able to choose from. The main concerning aspect is whether the gameplay will get repetitive. While the excitement of battle stayed strong throughout the 25 minutes I played, Im having a difficult time seeing the replay value in the game. The game could get boring once you settle into the game and the controls become second nature. Check out the trailer online for an example of graphics quality. I did find the graphics to be crisp and well polished.",4,18,13,373,1547,35,516,25,6,74.66,6.55,6.6,9.72
"For honor is a fantasy based fighting game that pins the samurai, knight, and Viking factions against each other. In terms of skill based game play the mechanics include parrying (controlled with timing) , blocking (directional input) , dodging (directional input as well as coinciding button press), attacking (controlled with directional input), and chain attacks ( heavy and light paired with directional input) While the game is fun, certain scenarios will make you angry, facing a team that gangs up on you will lead to your immediate death. In a game that stresses Honor (it is in the title after all) you may very well be faced with opponents who have zero of it what so ever. The customization of the characters is in depth and relies on a small part of RNG. Gear pieces can be awarded at the end of games or 'scavenged' in boxes or bought by using in game currency(that can be earned in game/bought) called steel. The leveling process to get the different tiers of weapon and armor qualities lead to a grind, but at times can feel rewarding. Downside to this game is the ability to boost by buying different armor sets to have permanently and/or status boosts (increase in xp, steel, more item drops) at the end of a game session. This model of microtransactions is common in Free to Play game models, but in a game that costs $60, it has no place in it unless it's purely based on cosmetic items. Overall fantastic game concept but executed rather poorly in a sense of server management as well as built around microtransactions.",3,4,1,271,1226,32,404,9,15,50.15,13.74,9.82,16.77
"Great concept and a beautiful game. The Fighting engine is great. Unfortunately, the released the game before it was complete and never really focused on the core issues. Instead of getting dedicated servers they used p2p which means getting connected and staying connected to an online match was near impossible. Everyone in the party had to have open NAT type just to have a chance. I believe they have servers now but much too late. instead of correcting connection issues they tinkered with the warriors. Killing great warriors and making other much too strong. I understand balancing, but taking a player that you have put a ton of hours into and making him unplayable is frustrating to say the least. Also the micro transactions are insane. My friend bought the $100 version of the game and didnt even get his perks. couldve been a GOY candidate",2,1,0,146,692,20,223,12,7,65.27,7.18,9.64,10.35
"I bought For Honor caught up in all the hype and it was worth it at first. Exploring the game was exciting and collecting gear while leveling up heros was great. Then the issues began. The game uses players xbox 1 systems as the servers for the game. Anyone with a bad connection who is the server or who leaves mid game freezes game play until another 'server' can be found. If a server is not found in enough time the game drops and all experiance and items you may have gathered are lost no matter how long the match has gone (matches can last 20 minutes). After one attempt at a game session of 3 hours i only completed 3 matches. At that point I gave up playing at all and havnt touched the game since. It would be fun but honestly its not worth the annoyance.",2,1,0,148,605,12,198,9,7,76.96,6.61,6.44,9.82

"For Honor is the best swords and Shields multi-player game I've ever experienced. You can play as either a Samurai, Vikings or Knights as different factions at war with each other and each one has multiple different classes to choose from and they all look and play differently. It's also not for children. Some of the execution finishing moves are brutal and could be in Mortal Kombat. They do look good though. Also a very polished looking game visually. Unique combat system with depth. And there are multi-player modes that u can play against the a team of computer controlled characters if u don't enjoy playing with other real players just for fun or to get better until your ready for other players. It also has a single player story mode for people that don't like playing with others at all. Very complete, good game and if your into the medieval time period even a little it's worth a purchase.",5,2,1,167,726,14,246,10,8,65.26,8.31,7.99,10.03

"First thing's first, if you haven't played Batman: Arkham Asylum then I recommend doing so. It hints back to what happened there often. If you haven't played it then you'll be sitting there looking pretty confused when you see Joker, Sharpe, and probably other things/people that I can't think of off the top of my head. Now look man, this game is a game of the year edition for a reason, all those 10 of 10's and 5 out've 5's you're seeing on the cover aren't make believe, this game is the real deal. Whether you're the world's largest batman fan or you've never even heard of him(which is unlikely) is irrelevant, this game is one of if not the best RPG games I've ever played. The gadget's you can use are awesome(there is quite a bit of them), the fighting is just flat out ridiculous, it put's in just the right amount of stealth to where you still get the thrill of stealth take downs but without over doing it to the point that it gets boring, tons of side-missions(optional), unfortunately no killer croc or scarecrow(atleast not that I know of), but there are still a good number of villains. The ending to the riddler's challenge in Arkham Asylum was just nonsense to me, they gave him a larger and better role in Arkham City. The thing that separates the regular B:A.C. from the game of the year edition to me was the fact that it brought in Robin and Nightwing. Unfortunately they aren't playable in the campaign mode, but you can use them in Riddler's Revenge(the challenge mode). I think Catwoman comes with the regular B:A.C. but you might want to double check that. Another thing as far as the challenge mode goes is you can use countless other costumes for Batman, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing( You can't use the other batman costumes in story mode until the main story is complete). The ending left me with a confused look on my face, but Harley Quinn's revenge made up for it. On challenging gameplay, I rated it a 4, but if I could I would give it a 4.5. Don't misunderstand me, it is a challenging game, it WILL make you think. The hand-2-hand could be a little bit more challenging in the campaign mode, but it get's pretty tough in Riddler's Challenge's. So if you just want to test yourself against a mosh pit of opponents then you can, just not so much in the story mode.",5,7,0,459,1791,32,614,21,8,71.48,8.72,5.79,11.53

"I got this game after playing through 'Batman, Arkham Asylum'. This game has a great storyline - it's almost like watching a movie and you are inside controlling Batman. The game is full of all of the familiar DC Comics characters and challenging bosses. This is one of the few games that I only had to take a cursory glance at the controller function buttons, and go to town without having to go online to 'cheat' my way through certain puzzles or scenes. It is intuitive and can offer hints #an option in the setup# if you are killed. The game is able to render 3D, but I can't comment on it as I don't have the special glasses needed. BTW, if you WANT to get the 3D glasses, don't expect the cheap ones used in movies to work. There are plenty of thugs to battle and tons of upgrades. Batman has a ton of gadgets to help him throughout the game. I'm 57 years old and addicted to this series - WB and Rocksteady have done a great job at bringing a decades old character to life in a game that will give you hours of amazing play. As a retired teacher, I would say that I would NOT recommend it for young children as there is some mature material throughout the game, but for teens on up, I think it's OK. I like the fact that when Batman has fights with the criminals, he never kills them - only knocks them out.

"I'm thoroughly enjoying the game so far but it's definitely not going to appeal to everyone. If you've played the first game then there's quite a few things done differently. To start off, the familiars are gone. Whether you are happy or not for this will depend on how you felt about that system. It is replaced with very standard Action RPG combat you can find in games like the Tales of Series and Kingdom Hearts. Characters can equip multiple weapons, learn skills (not the same as learning spells) and equip a sub weapon. What if you didn't play the first game? Well NNK2 stands on its own and doesn't really have much of a connection with the exception of a bit of location lore. Gameplay wise, the game is fast, fluid and beautiful but it's pretty easy. There's no difficulty settings to select so you're not going to struggle much if you've played a few JRPGs. Storywise, NNK2 isn't the strongest. The game focuses more on you assisting with King Evan quest to build his kingdom than resolving any conflicts or hunting down a primary villian. Cutscenes are short and voiced acted scenes are few and far between. You'll do more battling than you will reading/listening. For the story that the game does have, it's a pretty standard story of a young boy wanting to bring people together and live happily ever after (literally). One of the biggest parts of NNK2 is kingdom building. This is where things can drastically shift based on the player. Kingdom building is where you recruit your citizens, build different shops you can profit off and do some sidequests. This is a huge part of the game and partially optional. Do you need to fully max it out? No but there is a certain point you have to hit with your kingdom to continue the main story. So if you don't like the city management aspect of this game then that might be a bit of a problem. All in all, it's an enjoyable JRPG if you want a somewhat relaxing time. The biggest complaint I have is that the text while running around is incredibly tiny and autoscrolls far too fast for most people to be able to read. And I do wish some more of the game was voice acted as I feel that some of the scenes lost their impact due to their silence.",4,2,0,419,1747,39,577,25,7,73.32,7.2,6.95,10.43
"If you ever played the first or even if you haven't, this game was a blast to play. So many different styles of game play you can explore. While it can be difficult at times, if you take your time & enjoy the game, you'll eventually get the hang of it. The art style & music is top notch as well. If you're a casual RPG fan, you'll love this as well. Highly recommended.",5,1,0,76,281,6,100,6,3,82.66,4.88,3.6,8.22
"This game feels like its unfinished. Which is ridiculous because it was announced years ago. Most of the characters are one dimensional and contribute little to nothing, the plot is extremely boring, the pacing is way off, and the game is TOO easy. Theres a hard mode now but early adopters like me didnt have that option because it wasnt patched in yet. The battle system is decent as far as action RPGs go, but nothing that special, especially when a lot of us who wanted to play this when it first came out did not have a harder difficulty available. Even then, its not that great. Skirmish and kingdom building are way too arbitrary, clearly thrown into the mix to make you feel like you have a complete game, but its not hard to realize Ni No Kuni 2 was not really finished when they decided it was time to cease development and ship. Even the graphics are inconsistent. Some places are gorgeous, others fall short. This game was clearly not faring well in development and never got on the right track. Extremely disappointing, since the first game on PS3 was one of the best titles for that console.",2,1,0,200,885,21,290,11,9,65.71,8.61,8.59,11.47

"While so far there are only a few very small hints at ties to the first Ni No Kuni, this game definitely stands on its own. The kingdom-building aspect has been what I've sunk the most time into thus far, but the new locations and characters have been great as well. Combat isn't quite the hassle mechanically that it was in the first game (Familiars have been replaced by support creatures called 'Higgledies'), but the new engine does force some of the forested environments to be more open and less vegetated. The animated cutscenes have also taken a big step back, with far fewer vocalized sections instead replaced by text alone in most cases; the charm and quirkiness of the first game is lacking a bit because of this.

I couldn't hear the protagonist say 'live happily ever after' without wanting to backhand him. Since then I put it down. Its still a good game and I'll most likely continue but it seems very 'kiddy'. I prefer the Tales games a lot more. If you're ok with it the game is still fairly interesting with a lot of fun game mechanics and gameplay.

Many of the people you meet along the way will join your kingdom and help build your town, or even your armies. The more you do, the more you get, and I'm loving it.

The variety of enemies is also shockingly low with so... many... pallette swaps!

"Ive waited for a sequel to the original Ni No Kuni since it was released on PS3 in 2011. Ni No Kuni 2 delivers on brining the series onto the PS4 and updating many things that made the original a success. It has a very compelling story, the graphics although look cartoony - play very well, and I really enjoy the real time battle system. My only negatives are that it should have more voice acting and even though I enjoy the battles - the game is a little on the easy side. Ni no kuni games have never been ones that required you to grind for levels and it really shows when you are taking down enemies that are five levels higher than you. Another nice piece for the series is the kingdom builder - it adds an extra element that will both side you in your travels as well as bump up the number of hours logged in the game. I was able to beat Ni No Kuni 2 in about 40 hours and that does not include any of the additional content coming with the Season Pass. Overall, well worth the $48 paid to get an immersive RPG to fill your time until God of War comes out in a few weeks! :)",5,1,1,212,849,16,299,9,10,63.61,10.24,6.49,12.44
"Some people will actually like this game, I thought multi player wouldn't be a big deal - the other players don't actually bother me much at all. The issue for me was it feels like its geared to leveling up go here go there fast fast. Fallout for me was for the exploration, taking your time to look around. The map is great but I feel like you cant really explore it, enemies spawn all the time - clear an area and they re spawn so quickly. Not being able to pause and when dying having to go get your stuff back are online games I get that, I just don't like it. I have only played for 2 days but have gone back to red dead so take my view with that in mind - 2 days to decide I didn't like the game. I was looking for fallout, the small things you see like vault tec make you smile but overall the game play has changed enough for me not to like it.",2,12,1,176,659,8,219,7,9,76.05,8.9,5.04,11.88
"Despite being mutliplayer it felt as if very few (if any) players online wanted to interact. The notification message text was very small and didn't realize i recieved team requests until they sent it to me 4 times. The free in game items were nice but didnt benifit much other than grabbing the attention of online players for a few seconds. In game events felt boring, due to if you are in the vicinity of the event taken place it doesnt matter if you actively are participating, you would recieve the event prizes and xp without doing much of anything. There were many lag spots especially in areas where enemies would spawn making it hard to defend oneself during battle. At times i would recieve server errors and would be unable to play despite having perfect internet connection. I highly suggest not getting this game until bugs are fixed or if mmos arent your cup of tea.",1,7,1,158,712,18,243,7,12,53.81,11.36,9.39,13.59
"Let it be known that I loved Fallout 4. It was my introduction to the Fallout franchise. While I did go back and play bits of Fallout 1, 2, New Vegas, and 3, I played through Fallout 4 three separate times, eventually getting the platinum, 100% completion trophy on the PS4. Even when the story ended, I loved wandering around the Commonwealth and the DLC zones, finding all the cool little visual vignettes the designers had hidden in each broken down shack and ruined campsite. Each time I'd wander out -- alone -- I'd come back with bits of junk that would help me reinforce my settlement, personalizing my own little corner of post-apocalyptic Massachusetts. And in my survival playthrough, I'd have to think very carefully about just how much food, water, and ammo I had with me. That's what Fallout 76 is like, but in West Virginia, and with this constant feeling that some jerk is going to step out of the woods and end you for your inventory full of junk. It's light on story (yet heavy on lore, if you like reading terminals and listening to holotapes) and all about exploration and survival. Life is about food, water, radiation, ammo, and the deterioration of your weapons and armor. Now, I've been playing since the beta, and that hasn't happened to me, yet (knock on wood scraps). The limited number of players on each server and the humongous open world map make it really easy to not see another human-controlled character for an entire gaming session. When you combine that with the absence of any human NPCs, however, that can make Fallout 76 a very lonely experience. There has been a lot of controversy connected to the launch of this game. It is buggy. I have been disconnected a few times. There are choices that the developers made to make this work as a multiplayer game that futz up the solo Fallout experience I enjoyed in Fallout 4 (e.g., bobbleheads are a single-use perk, almost like a super chem), and others that are just weird (e.g., you can pack your power armor up and carry it around with you). I'm hoping Bethesda will do what Hello Games did with No Man's Sky and spend the next few months carefully addressing the issues their gamers are raising, while at the same time adding new and cool aspects to a 2.0 version of the game. If they do, I would come back and boost my review to 5 stars. If they don't, I could easily imagine this game fading to a 3- or even 2-star experience.",4,2,0,451,1898,47,650,24,8,65.83,8.75,7.37,11.69
"The NPC-less world is a bit stale, but doable between the story delivered via terminals and holotapes, but you very rarely run into other online players, whether you want the company or are just don't want the trouble of higher level characters bothering you. But personally, the technical problems like server disconnects, not saving quest progress for certain quests whether signing off or server disconnected, and spontaneously not being able to respawn anywhere among other things make this more of a hassle than fun to play. This is probably up there with destiny for buyer's remorse.",1,2,0,99,482,15,162,3,19,34.9,16.59,11.93,19.26
"This game was released way too soon. It lacks any engaging story elements, is online only, suffers from performance issues, and is overall fairly boring due to lack engaging content within the game.

I would not recommend purchasing this game until it has been further patched an improved.",2,2,0,72,332,10,110,4,10,59.32,9.46,9.67,12.76
"I've been a huge fan of the fallout series for a while now and I really started with Fallout 3 on the Xbox 360. I never completed 4, but will be going back to it soon. Especially now that I've shelved Fallout 76. I follow the two Fallout (Fallout and FO76) subreddits and while I appreciate what Bethesda has done for communication, it has really tarnished my feelings for the developer and in the future, I will be hesitant to purchase another one of their games until we see how it turns out. The lore is great. The exploration is fantastic! Unfortunately, this is about all the game has going for it. It's a huge bug-ridden mess, there are so many issues. Combat is clunky and don't even get me started on V.A.T.S. I play on an LG C7 OLED TV and while there is HDR, there are NO video options for brightness or anything of the nature. My TV is calibrated perfectly, yet this game is so bright - even in dark scenes. It all just looks washed out. The lack of including even the simplest things really drags this game down. The building feature of Fallout 4 was pretty much an 'experimentation' leading up to this game. There are just far too many issues and the game feels so lonely without the NPC's and dialog trees to go through, which are all highlights of any grand Bethesda game of this scale. Save yourself the money. Get something else instead. Wait 6, 9 or even 12 months and see if this game shows any improvement over that time span. Hopefully, Bethesda doesn't abandon this game. The ONLY reason I give this game 2 stars is because some parts of it are very enjoyable (the lore and exploration)...WHEN it works. This game does have promise and if handled properly, could be a fantastic addition to the franchise. Maybe they will 'rework' this like what happened to Final Fantasy XIV, when they turned it into 'A Realm Reborn'.",2,2,0,347,1446,34,491,26,5,73.58,6.31,6.48,9.26
"As an avid Fallout fan, I was of course excited about the new fallout being released. I was very willing to put up with more settlement building and online play (even though neither are things particularly well liked in the fallout community). What I have enjoyed about the last 3 fallouts in particular is the depth of the stories and NPCS/companions that you encounter that add to the gaming experience. What I can only assume is an attempt to cut cost and coding, there are no NPCs in this new Fallout. No companions. Only other wandering online players that may or may not kill you as much as ally with you. It really does feel like you are wandering through an empty wasteland. This will be the last game I pre-order; it does nothing but perpetuate bad habits of the industry. Save your money and go back an play New Vegas...",1,2,0,153,662,14,222,9,8,66.83,8.16,7.9,10.46

It doesn't even register Playstation accomplishments when it crashes but will still remember to steal your crafting materials, even when it made it impossible to have a chance to retrieve them. Extremely dull and grindy, there is no sense of progression after level 50-60. After you've found the major locations there is absolutely nothing. Crafting is 98% GARBAGE and very few useful plans(>1%) ever drop. Ridiculous amount of armor recipes, 100% of which are not ever worth crafting, it is all just for show. Perk card system stops progressing meaningfully after about level 70 and gets VERY annoying with all the card swapping. Zero effort was put into any quality of life touches regarding the perk system Inventory management is a never ending nightmare, there is no way to preset any armor combinations and food is constantly rotting with no easy way to manage it effectively. It is obvious that other than cut and pasting code from other Bethesda games and creating very little new art that this game had 4 months of rushed development, not 3 years.

The one thing that I have always loved about fallout is the great in depth story line that it runs with but with this game it is pure garbage. I think That due to its a one course way with no options how to get to the end. The lack of npcs I this game made it worse than vanilla games and just very bland. I do like the idea of playing with other players but it would be nice to be able to go through a nice story mode instead of an open world mode and basically a new version of fort ore/pubg which not everyone likes those trash games.

I would reccomend this game to anyone who has previously enjoyed the exploration aspects of Fallout games and does not mind it being light on the story aspect or the fact that it has a multiplayer/survival component. I would NOT reccomend this game to someone who is wanting it to be Fallout 5 or is expecting it to be a single-player RPG. It's not a cash grab as other reviewers are calling it.

By far the worst video game Ive ever purchased in my life. Theres nothing original or clever about this game. They clearly didnt want to pay a story writer and voice actors. Besides that the game it self crashes, freezes and is super buggy. There is no redeeming qualities about this game. Id say they swung and missed but after playing this you can tell its 100% a cash grab off of the success of previous titles.",1,1,1,109,449,7,153,8,5,74.26,6.29,6.25,8.02

"This is the first attempt from Bethesda to take the Fallout world online. There are not a lot of real changes from Fallout 4 when it comes to the graphics and overall game play. The lack of NPC's is a disappointment, but it is fun to play with friends. I have had the most fun by gathering up the 3 TV's in the house and having a few friends over with their PS4's and playing that way. Like the LAN parties back in the day. We tried 4 players, but the home internet connection could not handle it. Anyhoot, I think Fallout 76 is a good gaming experience overall. I feel that it is a good way to tide one over, until the next single player Fallout game comes out. Probably some time in the real 2076.",4,1,2,140,547,10,183,9,5,80.46,5.9,5.27,9.08

"I watched many reviews that bashed the beta but I did not want to base my opinion on early beta game bashers I wanted to have my own opinion so I bit the bullet and here are my impressions/review. After playing for a few hours of trial and error I bumped into a few players that added me to their group and that's when the game picked up for me. I have a few memorable things happen to me in the game,I was in a abandoned building with another player online and he said he would be back he was grabbing a snack so I decided to roam around outside while he came back but all of the sudden a level 20 scorcher elite came out of nowhere with his goons trying to kill me and I was just like lv 7 at that time and I had to run back into the building my friend was in and hide and you could hear the monster saying 'you will have to come out some day' I was like what?? lol so then my friend finally came back on and we ended killing the orcs and that was really fun. I like the perc card feat the leveling in the game etc. I am not too fond of the survival gimmick but its not a deal breaker because at times it makes me feel immersed. ok now the bad: Game lags like crazy and sometimes when you teleport to someone it will teleport you in the middle of zombies! smh.. another thing that is cringe worthy is how sometimes you have to do a mission were dracula in dragon form spawns out of nowhere flying in the sky spitting some green fire.ohh and he is level 50! it becomes such a pain to get to where you need to go. over all the game is fun with some frustrations that I am hoping they will fix and I think that at this rate it is too early to fully bash on the game since its so early and games like the division and battlefront had bumpy rides also so we will have to wait and see.",4,2,3,369,1397,19,472,12,12,67.41,11.5,5.5,14.36

The game times these unlocking, so you get one per day. I bought this game despite already having the Wii U version because it is a GREAT 2D platformer with tight controls and tons of secrets. There isn't a ton of challenge if you just breeze through it, but it you want to collect everything, the game can get pretty difficult and challenging if that is what you want.

You explore all of kind of different areas from jungles to snowy peaks, and collect fruit to unlock more bumpers to knock you around to other areas. I highly recommend this if you're looking for something different. It can be frustrating at times, and it's annoying that there isn't any fast traveling, but I think the creative pinball/platforming mechanics make up it on their own.",5,1,0,135,597,13,195,8,8,67.51,8.04,8.45,10.6

With the statements that follow, keep in mind I've sunk over 24 hours of gameplay in already. So far I've noticed a few times where the ground does not render in quick enough but this is infrequent and usually only if moving quickly, just wait for a second to let it load in. There was some choppiness in very high activity zones but that smoothed out after all the elements rendered in (takes a few seconds). One time a save was lost, lost about an hour of game time (frustrating but not too bad). Overall, this is an incredible game that I intend to continue sinking hours and hours into because it is so rich and interesting. The map and environments are beautiful and terrifying at the same time. I highly recommend it on the Xbox as I believe the devs have fixed most of the issues and it is highly playable, but be prepared to occasionally have an issue once in a while - just be sure to save often.",5,1,0,210,861,20,292,9,10,65.52,9.92,7.04,13.14

"Lego Harry Potter's gameplay is similar to that of most previous Lego video games, with an emphasis on collecting, exploring, and solving puzzles. Casting spells is an integral part of the gameplay, with a wide range of spells available for unlocking as the player progresses. As there are many spells available in the game, the player can use the spell wheel to select the spell. Potion-making is another integral feature; potions can help the player complete levels or, if created incorrectly, have adverse side effects",4,0,2,87,424,17,144,4,13,44.73,12.42,11.5,16.52

"Battlefield one is the excellent counter to call of duty's infinite warfare, and a perfect answer to the longing of many gamers (myself included) to play a shooter that doesn't cast them as a barely human cyborg, powered by cybernetic implants. It is the difficulty of BF1 that makes it so compelling. It is incredibly inconvenient every time you reload your weapon, and your character takes 30 seconds or so to do it, but at the same time, a little grin creeps on to my face each time it happens. Health is hard to regain, unless you have a medkit, and it is not uncommon to be unable to ADS because of the gasmask on your face, protecting you from a deadly cloud of mustard gas. It's these little details, that make this came so compelling. The story is incredibly powerful as well. From the opening sequence where you play as about 5 different characters, all of whom inevitably perish, the game powerfully conveys the hopelessness of a war where battlefield tactics had yet to catch up to the death dealing technologies of the period. The Short anthology type stories do a great job of highlighting specific aspects of the war. These stories are extremely moving, as they manage to connect you to the characters and create meaningful development over the course of only three or four levels. BF1 also features an immensely fun multiplayer. The most enjoyable aspect of which is the new operations feature; a bit of a cross between domination, and rush, with the large scale chaos of conquest. One match will take about 3 rounds, and sometimes moves to a different map. Usually at least once in a course of a match, one side is reinforced by a zeppelin, train, or dreadnought battleship. The scope of the matches is monstrous. Each time you spawn in, the camera zooms into a spot on the map, speaking to how small, helpless, and inconsequential each soldier must have felt; especially when there are things like Zeppelins looming in the sky, raining death on all who dare to venture underneath. Whether you are a hardcore fps gamer, or someone who is interested in history, and compelling heroism, Bf1 is a mightily entertaining experience.",5,4,1,376,1722,56,579,16,12,52.71,11.75,9.87,15.36

"Every year I purchase the latest Battlefield and Call of Duty titles. I have a difficult time choosing between them, so I wind up just picking up both. I have to say that with both franchises going back to basics, it has made it a great year for fans of both of these series. That being said, when it comes to realism and keen attention to detail, I have to give this year's award to Battlefield 1. There are so many little things that are captured in this game that really help immerse you in the action. Sure, it's still a first person, fast paced shooter, but everything from the destructible environment to the way the weapons respond are just done so well here. If you have a chance to pick this version up, do it. So much added content and multiplayer maps give this game very high replay value. It is also very refreshing to not have enemies running up walls and jet-packing over you to take you out from out of nowhere. This is what first person shooters should be like. It brings the genre back to basics and you can tell there was a ton of work put into this game, Very impressive and a must buy!!",5,1,0,213,874,15,286,11,8,73.59,7.81,6.8,10.56

"XCOM2 is true to the original storyline. It was great fun to play and certainly met my expectations. The XCOM series are my favorite turn-based games. A couple of things that diminished gameplay: 1) There were some stutters and technical glitches with cut scenes and actual gameplay. Mostly annoying, but it was noticeable and occasionally halted play. I suspect they'll patch and update soon. 2) Multiplayer for XB1 doesn't exist. No matter how I tried, I could not enter, join, or host an online match in any way, shape, or form. I love multiplayer, and was really disappointed. Again, an upcoming update will probably include a fix. 3) Actions/reactions and their results during actual mission play were mostly random and unpredictable. This is as it should be. But when looking at the Bridge screens and participating in that part of the game, the progress was TOO predictable. I had no trouble telling when an emergency mission would pop up and require my attention. I finally got annoyed and sometimes just skipped over an 'urgent mission' because it always got in the way of my soldiers' healing, research, construction, etc. Likewise, the timing of the game's progress on it's final countdown to disaster was also easily predicted. I still really loved this game, and am going through a second run-through at a more difficult level. While this game (like most) has a linear story, the best part is the missions which have much more random play. This gives me a number of 'what if' actions and reactions to try out from saved game files. If you're a fan of XCOM, you'll overlook the glitches and hiccups. It's a great game, with hours of fun play.",4,1,0,294,1312,34,433,21,7,68.03,7.25,8.33,10.23

"Come on now its soul calibur one of the most underrated fighting games ever and despite it not be big as tekken ,MK it doesnt matter with this game you can see what fighting is about and despite it missing the big chronicles mode we had in the 2nd one the character creation does make up for it",5,2,0,58,236,5,78,1,27,34.19,22.9,7.62,26.65
"After a good half day of knocking on the fighting engine, it feels good. I felt the high point was SC2, 3 and 4 were good but, lacked something. While I 100% completed SC1 and SC2, I fell out of playing 3 and 4 after a few hours. This doesn't feel quite as difficult to recommend. The gameplay runs well, the controls are tight, and the match load times aren't bad. The basic additions to the game include the reverse edge mechanics and a gage mechanic. In my limited game play against the AI, I don't find it overpowering nor cheap. The game play looks good, provides a nice clash mechanic, and I like it. The visuals are quick to parse and provide the relative info about the attack type. Lightning effects or Fire effects indicate specific attack types. The bad includes a troubling tendency to slice a fighting game into pieces and reselling it a character at a time. Day 1 DLC has no real place in the market and should be abolished. Tira was a built in character in 3 on and they only cut her to make for a pre-order/season pass bonus. In short, a good fighting game marred by marketing and with some interesting additions to a solid fighting system.",4,1,0,219,913,21,304,14,7,73.52,6.89,6.82,10.09

I love how is fosters teamwork and delegation and support from one another. Now, compared fo Overcooked 1, this game has excellent additions and challenges. The additions (one of them being a way to throw food to others) is superb. Plus, online co-operative play is an new addition...but I would argue that while a nice option, the game is far more enjoyable to do with others in the same room.

The character dialogue is so KOTOR and ME. Kinda weird, but makes you learn about the world you are playing in. I'm not sure I'll have a real opinion until I get to end game where drops matter more. I think this game will be dependent on how that looks for longevity. You definitely feel more powerful as you level.",4,4,1,91,375,9,125,7,5,77.43,5.69,6.15,9.16
"First of all stay away from the Legend of Dawn edition it's a ripoff. The unique weapon is no longer useful after a few hours of game play and you can buy better looking armor with the coins you earn through the in game merchant. This has to be one of the most stunning XBOX games I have ever played. But the amount of game play it takes to level up your character will become unbearable. Many of my friends that left Destiny 2 have returned due to the absolutely poor drops in Anthem. I played just a few days ago for 4 hours on Grand Master 1 and did not get anything I already had gotten a dozen times or more. Even on the higher Grand Master settings the rare drops are few and far between. Some posts say it may take 10-20 hours of game play to get an item you need. In short, if you love stunning graphics this is a must own. But if you hate grinding run away from this game!",4,2,0,178,693,7,229,10,6,79.93,6.53,5.43,8.69
"Let me start by saying that I went into this game with an open mind despite what reviewers were saying. I really really wanted to like this game. I've been playing it for over a week straight. It was cool to fly around an open world, land, shoot enemies, complete various objectives, etc. The story is kinda forgettable. The main hub/fort is vibrant but also kinda lacking at the same time. Comparing what was released to what was shown a few times at E3 is really disturbing. It looks and plays nothing like that. That 'gameplay' trailer was a complete lie. The loading screen will be your new friend as its what you will see 60% of the time. This game has bugs.....LOTS OF THEM. Bugs ranging from the sound completely going out, to mission objectives that never appear causing an entire mission to have to be quit and redone, to constant crashes to the games title screen, crashes to Xbox home, and times when the game just completely freezes. This game in all honesty is a godforsaken mess. What the heck happened Bioware? Oh yeah, thats right, EA happened. Lets also talk about the loot system and drop rate. It is for the most part broken and just bad. Playing on Grandmaster 1 will still drop some common items laughably and 99% of what you get ranges from Uncommon to Epic. Very rarely and I mean VERY VERY rarely you may get a Masterwork item (Better than Epics). Which comes to the reason I am here reviewing this game and ceasing any more play time with this horrendous junk. Tonight, after pouring hours and hours playing and doing missions and strongholds......Finally, a LEGENDARY dropped. MY FIRST ONE IN ABOUT 60-70 hours. These things never ever drop, I mean never. The planets must have been aligned for me to actually get one. I finished up Freeplay, which is where I got it, quit the expedition. While its loading guess what happens, CRASH TO XBOX HOME. Everything I had just done and received.....GONE. The game doesn't save until the end of a mission. In a buggy disgusting mess like this, the developers put the save at the very end!? I was in complete shock and could not believe it. I also think the game is partly rigged to do that when you get good drops so you have to grind this garbage forever with no reward. Do yourselves a favor people, avoid this game and stay very far. Don't even accept it as a gift and don't even take it for free. We should be getting paid by Bioware and EA for play testing and putting up with this no-where-near-finished shell of a 'game'. Instead we paid top dollar for a buggy mess. I haven't bought EA games in a long time and gave this a chance. Done with EA and Bioware, never spending a dime on their half finished games again.",1,3,1,504,2108,36,690,40,5,78.22,5.48,6.44,7.9

It takes some time to learn what your focus should be in the game. The open world I feel will continue to grow and this very well could become a classic like Destiny. Destiny got some negative reviews when it released and now Destiny 2 is one of the top games. The graphics are some of the best Ive seen on my Xbox X. The worlds are so realistic is is a pleasure to just explore. Being able to jump and fly in your suits is way cool. I got the Legion of Dawn edition on sale for $32.

"The beta had more glitches than the game of today. I can play for hours now and not experience game play issues. I've never played a game that didn't need patches. Cons first: It doesn't have 'Borderlands type' dialog (my #1 co-op shooter). A lot of people aren't mic'd up. I completed 100% of the missions without vocal communication from other team members, but the game feels less like a 'team effort'. Also, with more team coordination the game would be more 'tactical', and progression in the game would move at a faster pace. Pros: You have to play the game on 'hard mode' to give weight to flying around and battling foes. That's what make this game really really fun. The weapons in the game feel amazing, and I don't believe one gun does it all. I'm using all the weapons, and the special abilities are awesome to use. The micro-transactions are a joke, and don't impact my game- play since you can make your suit unique by using thousands of color combos. Selling dropped guns and completing missions can produce coins that give you the ability to purchase items in the micro-transaction market. If you read reviews, they talk about the fact that once the glitches get resolved the game will be much better. At that time the game would be able to get to 4 stars but never 5.",3,0,3,244,1004,16,329,15,7,76.25,6.66,6.58,9.13

Yes, I really enjoy Destiny 1 and 2. I also really enjoyed The Division and Diablo 3. I did not like Fallout 76, but that was a huge cluster which this doesn't compare to. The loading screens do suck, but Division has them. Destiny has them. Get an SSD to mitigate this. It did wonders for me in Division.",4,1,5,108,464,17,162,10,5,68.97,6.32,6.72,10.62

"This much anticipated game is truly fun to play. The flight mechanics, gun play, enemies/bosses all feel good. There have been quite a few bugs, but BioWare is listening to the community, responding (being as transparent as possible), and squashing the bugs in a timely fashion. Good game IMO, and a rather large area to play with lots to do and find. Two thumbs up.",4,0,1,66,288,10,97,5,6,69.1,6.9,7.62,11.34
"While other reviews may not shock and awe, I like this game. It has a Destiny feel but more freedom. I liked Destiny's overall premise but the gameplay and loot system weren't great, and the coordination required more, along with not being able to do certain things without a pre-formed group. I like that this still allows matchmaking in the dungeons and missions. The graphics are great and overall the gameplay is fun.",5,2,3,76,338,8,109,5,8,70.07,7.26,8.4,10.29

"So far so good, I am enjoying more than Destiny 1 and 2. It is a bit of a grind having to talk to so many people in town. The story line is on the shorter side but there are plenty of other missions and contracts to keep you busy. Leveling up your player takes forever. But from what I read they are working on fixing some of that and it sounds like the DLC to come will be free, so that works. So far I'm enjoying.",5,0,2,88,320,4,110,6,4,86.2,4.88,3.56,7.68
"This game has gotten a lot of uncalled for negative press. A lot of streamers are bashing this game due to its lack of end game content but as a new IP the expectation of having a plethora of content endgame was talked about beforehand.

"The NBA Live series has come a long way. In a few years, the series has gone from an absolute joke, to an actual fleshed out and worthwhile game. I still would like to see Live give you more flexibility in the franchise mode like NBA 2k does. To be more specific, I would like to be able to play as any team I want to during franchise mode within the same season. This is not something Live allows you to do at this time. The other aspect that needs a little work is the post game. It feels a little generic. I do like the efforts Live has put into the animations. They definitely are closing in on 2k in this area. Where Live has won me over, is the continual evolution of this game. Since the game has been released, the Live development team has been hard at work with numerous gameplay improvement patches as well as visual enhancements. Most of which were pulled from NBA Live community feedback. Some people see this as a negative, stating that this game should have had these patches in place prior to it's initial release. However, I look at it as great customer service and a willing to listen to their community to give us what we want. There is not enough of this going on in the gaming industry and it is a very welcomed concept. Most games will have periodic improvements that occur over the course of several follow up releases, but Live's team has made the effort to continually improve a product that has been out for over 4 months now. We will have to see what that will mean for NBA Live '20, but in the meantime, I applaud EA and the Live development team for their efforts in trying to give their fans a quality product.",4,1,0,312,1301,30,437,17,8,69.71,8.1,7.11,11.19

"I am not a 'car person' by any stretch of the imagination, and yet, I'm incredibly addicted to this game. I bought the game on a whim based on the exorbitant amount of positive reviews, and I'm glad I did. The game is full of detail, allowing players to take every little piece of car apart. You are awarded experience points for repairing cars so you can increase your level and obtain new tools, abilities, and better garage facilities. It's like an RPG with cars. It's also a bit of a puzzle game. Customers will give you clues by describing issues they are having with their car, and it is up to you to locate the problem and repair it.

"To start, I wanted to give this a 4.5 star review. Here's why. Back in 2003, Blue Tongue entertainment developed a Jurassic Park game where you bred dinosaurs and created your own park. This was awesome. The game became a legend. Now, the fun is brought back with JWE (Jurassic World Evolution). Unlike its predecessor, you start JWE on isla Mataceros. This is the softball thrown to get you into the game. You're given a limited set of dinosaurs that you can breed and a few buildings. The game guides you through how to succeed. It's great to finally have a tutorial. The interface is much better than before. You have alerts that appear at the top of the screen to keep you abreast of incidents that will lower your park's rating. The shoulder buttons can be used to quickly access ACU and Rangers (which you need for emergencies). The D-Pad gives fast access to different buildings and object placement. There's even a dashboard menu (opened with Square) that tells you everything you need to know at a glance. It's never been this easy to run a Jurassic World/Jurassic Park. There are 50+ dinosaurs in this title. Most Dinosaurs are unlocked by excavating fossils. Dinosaurs range from classics like T-Rex and Triceratops to overlooked dinosaurs like Chunkingosaurus and Struthimimus. If you complete the right objectives, you can even unlock both Indominus Rex (Jurassic World) and Indoraptor (Fallen Kingdom). I have mixed feelings about the Deluxe Dinosaurs sold as DLC. For an additional $12, you can purchase 7 more dinosaurs that were included in the Deluxe downloadable version. The animation looks super realistic. Dinosaurs walk, socialize, fight, and even hunt in realistic fashions. The only animation complaint I would give is the kills start to follow quickly identifiable patterns. Dinosaurs of a specific build will use the same kill animations. An example is when a velociraptor hunts a goat, the animation is the same as a dilophosaurus (without the frills). Something unexpected is the story behind the game. There are missions that unlock other islands and content, but these missions also feature dialog between characters. As you listen to the dialog, you start to uncover some of the more insidious secrets to Jurassic World. Overall, I'd strongly recommend this game. It's a great experience and fun for the whole family.",4,6,0,401,1889,63,636,34,7,60.69,7.72,9.39,11

"FULL REVIEW: linklink I do not know anyone that does not like dinosaurs, but that does not immediately make Jurassic World Evolution for everyone. RTS was the correct choice for this game, but many gamers may lose patience with the title. One thing that continues to bug me as I play is the lack of a pause option like The Sims has. Yes, you can pause the game, but I mean stopping time in the park so you can survey, assess and plan things. It would be great were that to be added. I also think that PC players will get the overall best experience as this game begs to be played with a mouse.",4,2,1,115,467,9,153,6,8,74.83,7.58,6.53,10.8
"Bought this digitally as the physical copy comes out a month after the digital so if you are looking to play asap, without a doubt buy it digitally. The roster of 42 dinosaurs plus the 5 from the digital deluxe edition give it a good variety to create living ecosystems across the 5 islands. The systems in place to balance the three branches of entertainment science and security. The creation system and management system are fantastic, the only con I can point out is the control system. It is a little wonky and was clearly designed for PC but it still works on console.",5,13,12,104,464,16,167,5,10,49.87,11.47,9.01,14.47

"One of my all-time favorite games is the old Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, which I still replay up to this day. Jurassic World Evolution is the 'sequel' to that awesome game, with the new Jurassic World in play. It looks great, plays great, and is still lots of fun! You start off with one island, and you have to proceed enough in the game to unlock the other 5 islands and more dinosaurs to dig for and breed. And one of the islands is the original island from Jurassic Park (which is open and with no budget! A big thanks to Jurassic Park movie fans, I would say). THIS IS NOT AN ACTION GAME... it's a sim game, so know this and research the gameplay BEFORE you buy it, so you know what you're getting. I love this game and am glad I got it, despite initial apprehension (I didn't think it would be as good as the original).",4,0,1,163,642,15,218,9,7,75.31,7.25,5.72,10.93
"I never review games but after purchasing this one this afternoon I thought I should come here and say I love this one. I was looking for something casual and fun, and I got it. I love dinosaurs and the ones in this game are beautiful. The controls are a bit wonky but if you can play The Sims on the PS4 you will be fine here. If you love Jurassic Park and/or dinosaurs do yourself a favor and get this one. Just hearing Ian in the beginning was enough to have me grinning and the hours following were just as awesome...until Grady showed up. Disregard Grady..",5,0,1,109,442,11,147,8,5,78.91,5.64,5.87,9.49
"I am basing this review off my 10 year old purchasing this game with his birthday money. It's not an easy game to figure out and it's easy to get stuck and to the point you can't do anything. The makers of this game would do well to add more prompts and information especially when first starting the game. Example...everything you build in the park needs power which is almost impossible to figure out how to do and there are no instructions or guidance. Thank goodness for youtube and other gamers who have put this information on there.",3,0,2,102,431,10,143,6,7,70.97,7.58,7.3,10.72

"This game may be good for kids 10 or 11 years old but as an avid gamer and someone who loves builders,sim,and management games this game truly is horrible imo. Theres nothing really to do in this game but watch dinosaurs walk around it's really not that fun, the items you unlock as the game progresses,doesnt really add anything. I do no recommend this game to anyone,especially at $59,99. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PARENTS ,THIS GAME ISNT WORTH IT",1,1,6,86,356,11,122,4,9,65,9.53,7.16,13.72
"This collection is a great buy. I put it in, and instantly jumped right back into games that I remember from my childhood. Also I just turned 23, so some of these games are before my time. It feels good to discover them. Streets of Rage 2 is a great beat em up game. Phantasy Star IV is one of the first RPG's of large scale, even on the Sega Genesis. Sonic 2 was alwys fun, and even had terrific level design. Comix Zone was tons of fun to play with its inavative leve design, and gameplay mechanics. That is only a handful of the games that you will experience with this collection. I gave the challenge rating a 5 because believe it or not, some of these games were quite difficult. This collection also features every entire game, and has a save feature which many of them did not support back then. Simply put, this is a great way for older gamers to remember the games they enjoyed and for younger gamers to discover a forgotten age of gaming.

"This is easily one of the best retro collections ever. I owned a Sega Genesis many years back and this collections has most of my favorites. It's gret having Sonic the Hedgehog, Columns, Streets of Rage, Shinobi and Vectorman all in one collection. The controls work very well, which I am thankful for. I have played some retro collections where current controllers were not taken into account, but Sega has worked these games so the PS3 Dualshock 3 works perfectly with all games. The graphics may be dated, but the fun is not. Many of these games still hold up alongside the current generation of games and are still a lot of fun to play. It's also interesting to see how the graphics of the Genesis games evolved over time as technology improved. Play an earlier game like Alex Kidd or E-SWAT and then play Vectorman 1 or 2 to see what I mean. There are a few minor bugs in terms of sound and graphics in a very small number of areas, but nothing that will have any real effect on your enjoyment of the games. These were probably in the original games and may be fixed with future operating system upgrades. Also, the original Genesis cartridge for Sonic & Knuckles had a feature that let you play as Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic 2 and 3, but that is not in this collection for some reason (maybe it will be a future download). Despite these two minor issues, I would recommend this to anyone who ever had a Sega Genesis or who has an interest in retor gaming.",4,6,0,272,1166,32,399,13,10,61.5,9.88,7.99,13.08

However, there's nothing to really detract from the nostalgia.

It also is the only game i know of that can play music straight from the XMB while in game. What's also cool is that there is a SAVE feature on all the games!

Im usually sucked in by final fantasy storyline but this one didn't intrigue me at all after like 5 hours of playing went back and traded it in. best thing about the game was the demo IMO. If you loved it or liked it on psp and want to replay it, go for it. It is a remake for a specific fan base and it does look better than it did on psp so in that case it's worth playing, but not for the ridiculous 60 dollar price. Maybe a 30 dollars game at best.

The graphics are straight up bad and the camera sucks booty. type 0 has a lot going for it so it overcomes it's faults and the characters are actually not annoying for the first time in forever.

"This is a port of a mobile game, and based on the responsiveness of the controls it certainly feels like it at many points. You should know that the game is made to be replayed over and over again with many sections of your first play-thru guarded by monsters Lv. 60-99. Many other missions and stories won't be available until later play-thrus, some only unlocking on your 3rd play-thru. The achievements are simple enough to get on a single play-thru, but after that it just seems later play-thrus for a couple extra missions on top of more grinding to be able to complete them is a bit much. At that point, it's less of a challenge and more of just a grind. Not a bad game, but definitely not optimized for a console experience. It's good if you're the kind of person who likes repetitive grinding for incremental yet paltry rewards.",2,1,0,161,663,10,224,8,9,68.7,8.68,6.94,10.53

"The game is an HD version of a PSP title, and it shows. Some areas look disastrous, and some look good. The real problem is the price - $60 is insane for a PSP game. Considering that other PSP ports were quite cheap (Peace Walker HD, for example), you can tell Square loves to nickel and dime its fanbase. Essentially, this is a $40 (tops) game packaged with a $20 demo. Also the demo runs at a garbage resolution on Xbone: 1408x792.",3,1,0,81,332,7,112,6,5,76.15,5.99,6.11,8.86

Each fighter has a distinctive move set and style of fighting, utilizing each fighters strengths and weakness is paramount to ensure success and a top rating.

"I first played Devil may cry 1 , 2 & 3 on the ps2 and then played Devil May Cry 4 on my Xbox 360, and what an awesome ride they all were. We then were given DMC ( Devil May Cry ) as what seemed like a reboot of the series, it received a mixed bag of reviews, as some of the changes were just a little to much for some of the die hard fans of the original Devil May Cry to accept. I think the biggest change was to Dante himself, apart from just not sounding like himself he also received a total new character model, the most shocking thing being the short dark hair style instead of the longer white hair . I know that something like hair length and color might seem kind of petty but MANY people really had a problem with it and I as well had to get used to the new look, voice and hair. Now after the initial shock as I began to play the game the issues I had began to fade from memory as the gameplay of DMC was just as fun, flashy and furious as it was in the original games. During the early cut scenes I would see our new Dante and still get a slight feeling of wrongness about him, but after a little more play I didn't even think about it again. The game is just to great to let the little things I mentioned above keep you from having a blast with this game. Now on to our new flashy Xbox One version ( Definitive Edition #.. This is still the DMC you remember except with upgraded polished graphics # it looked awesome on the 360 ) and running at 60 fps and 1080P. I can tell you that the new polish and increase in frame rate and resolution make this already beautiful game simply jaw dropping.. DMC is full of color and is amplified to the extreme in this new version , leaving you drooling at the beauty of this game, and the 60 frames per second give you some of the silkiest controls you have ever had.. This is the question , is a game you have played before worth the purchase price again ? That is what you have to ask yourself. To me at the low price point of 39.99 it is a steal . The new graphics , frame rate and resolution alone are enough for me because I truly enjoyed the game on my 360. If you have never played this game or any of the past entries you are in for a real treat at a relatively low price point. Great price and great value , this is one game that I can say is a must play.. Solid 5 out of 5 Side note : If you don't like Dante's new look you can change his appearance with the character model skins that come packed in this new version. I have been using the skin from the first Devil May Cry and he now looks like our old Dante. There are a selection of skins , I think you have a choice of a skin from DMC 1 - 4 . so if for some reason you don't want to play as the new redesigned Dante you can put one of the skins provided on him and just forget about the new look.. I personally think that was a nice touch for this edition.. Edit : 3-15-15 -I have completed the game on Demon Hunter difficulty and have completed the extra content Virgil's fall.. The main campaign took me about 91/2 hours to complete and I completed Virgil's fall in about an hour & 45 min. I know some could complete this game faster but I am one that looks in every nook and cranny for collectables and such. But even if I didn't you could only shave off maybe 45 min to an hour . But I put in about a total of about 11 hours and 10 minutes into my first play through , and that's not a bad game length at all .. Not to short and not to long , it just feels about right and never over stays it's welcome.. Now it's time to start again on the next hardest difficulty and get some more achievements and enjoy the game all over again.",5,3,0,732,2827,33,942,30,9,73.2,9.11,5.7,11.56

"I would say this is probably one of the most campiest, cheesiest, yet kinda beautiful and decent RPG's to hit the PS4. Now most people may not know about this game but actually this game has been around for 5 years. I first purchased it on 360 in 2010, then on PC on a Steam sale 2 years ago, and now I purchased the PS4 version hoping that I will actually play more than 60% of this game and finish it. Nevertheless, in comparison to the other versions, I can say the PS4 version is the definitive version of this game. The textures are re-done quite nicely, pop-in is non-existent which was a huge problem in the other versions, and the combat/enemy animations appear 10X more fluid than earlier. This version also contains the separate expansion: The Fall of Setariff which is an added bonus. However, with these said do not expect a great game. In fact, I would say Two Worlds is a better game than this if you know what I mean. But on the contrary to that, know this is not necessarily a bad game. It's a very simple RPG, hack and slash and can be repetitive, confusing, silly, frustrating, janky, and could put you to sleep (problem playing earlier versions). But if you can overlook these cons, it's a pretty decent experience! One of the things that has helped me to avoid losing interest in the PS4 version, is increasing the difficulty to the hardest level: 'Gothic.' This has turned the game into a more 'Dark Souls' experience but make no mistake this game is still just alright. I give it 4 stars because it's not that bad, there are a lot of good ideas present (sawing wood for no reason, taking a bath for no reason, sleeping for no reason, using smithing tools for no reason, etc) that you can tell that maybe there was not enough time to get developed into the full release. I think with this latter aspect, they were trying to go for a 'Skyrim' experience but IDK.(JoWood if you are out there correct me if I am wrong). There is some good humor in this game, good environment/enemy designs, and good combat concepts. The bow and arrow feel actually pretty satisfying. Anyway, if you can get it cheap, it's not bad.",4,3,0,402,1669,37,569,19,9,65.61,9.36,7.21,12.14
"I wasn't expecting much from a cheaper RPG, and I got a little bit more from Arcania:The Complete Tale. This game may be no Fallout or Witcher, but it is another good RPG to play on PS4.

I recommend this game to anyone that has The Witcher 3 that may want another RPG to play to take a break from The Witcher.",4,2,0,86,320,10,118,4,7,68.93,8.99,4.7,13.25
"Arcania is one of those games which actually on a ps4 shouldn't exist. Best description of game is its a fantastic ps2 game with early ps3 graphics.

"This is a tough one to recommend. It's a spiritual sequel to a 15 year old game that is unlike anything else on consoles. The gameplay is very unusual, it involves talking to very, very chatty characters, listening to their stories, then deciding whether or not to help them. There is almost no action to be found, just a lot of decision making. The story is very large and confusing, and seemingly made up of 100's of short stories all woven together. If that all sounds fun to you I recommend giving it a chance. Otherwise pass. An added bonus is that buying it on disc means you'll get a ton of extra. A soundtrack CD, a map, some bonus content, and even a thank you note from the devs.",2,1,0,133,539,16,192,9,6,69.71,7.21,6.03,10.72

This is one of the best game on the 3DS in my opinion.",5,1,0,73,290,7,99,4,7,73.58,7.53,5.94,11.14
"A spin off of the mainstream Monster Hunter. I liked how you can gather eggs to hatch monsters (the eggs have patterns to tell you what kind of monster you are hatching), and also have the ability to create stronger ones by messing with their genes. The fighting system is pretty simple and is basically a rock/paper/scissor game. I haven't messed with the online, but you can challenge other people to battles. The monster field abilities are similar to HM moves on Pokemon, but don't take up any slots on the monster. You can try the demo which is the beginning of the game, and transfers everything over to the full game. Careful though because I don't think there's a level cap in the demo, so you could be way over leveled when you transfer the game.",5,1,0,143,599,8,202,7,9,66.6,9.05,7.38,10.41

"Layton games typically interweave a masterful 3D environment (for 3DS), a good story, some exploration, puzzle solving, and video sequences. This Layton game fails across the board. There's no use of 3D in this edition and the story is mind numbingly boring. The scene design is Laytonesque but lacks the detail and features expected from previous work. The puzzles are few and far between compared with previous titles and finally include trick puzzles. While at first I welcomed the inclusion of trick puzzles, their overuse and lack of variation make them tremendously predictable. The video sequences are short, contribute nothing, and are of low quality. The quality of Layton games has improved over time since Curious Village all the way up to the crossover Layton vs Wright. That is until this. The product has all the hallmarks of being rushed and poorly planned. Let's hope this is a one off blunder. Wait for this game to hit the bargain bin before buying.",1,1,2,164,783,26,258,12,8,59.87,8.3,10.11,11.81
"Im not great at reviews but I had to try for this game. The best part of this game is the storytelling. Any JRPG fan will appreciate it. Think back to the great ol days of JRPG storytelling, if you miss those days then buy this game. You'll love it. It takes place in a world split into different realms after a Human vs. Daemon war 1,000 years ago. You'll lead a group that eventually equals 9 on a journey to free the world from the control of 'Daemons.' The battle system is reminiscent of the romancing SaGa series. If you are a fan of the SaGa series from Square Enix then buy this game. This might be one of the last great 3DS games. Definitely one of the last great JRPG'S on 3DS. I collect this stuff so I got 2. I wanted to keep one sealed for my collection. I'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10 just because I'd love to see what it could be with a bigger budget. I definitely recommend this game.",5,2,0,186,700,11,240,17,2,86.57,3.9,3.62,6.74

"When I saw this game get announced I was interested in getting my hands on it. The team behind it previously made the game called Legend of Legacy and while the art style of that one was slightly off-putting and the game was serviceable it didn't quite scratch that JRPG itch that I had but after going back to the drawing board and taking fan feedback from that game they released a solid JRPG experience that blows there previous title out of the water so pick this game up and join the alliance and go on an epic journey.",5,1,0,101,422,8,137,2,24,40.82,20.11,8.18,23.37
"So first off this was the first time I played this game, I guess it flew under my radar back in the day. Recently it caught my attention being a steal at $9,99. I looked a some reviews on YouTube and it immediately looked like something I wouldve played growing up. Theres something about these older action adventure games that hit home for me. If youre going into this one for the first time know that this isnt some passionate remaster like the recent Spyro. Its still very much the same game as it was in 2003, but dont let that detour you. Yes, the controls can be a little clunky at times and sure the puzzles can be a little frustrating but for me thats apart of its charm. It doesnt hold your hand either, so if youre used to games that keep you on training wheels this one probably isnt for you. Like I said, I snagged it for $10 at the time and for me that was without a doubt worth it.",4,1,0,176,705,9,226,9,8,78.35,7.19,6.24,9.87

"Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy came out in the days of the Playstation 2, Xbox, Gamecube, and Dreamcast -- though the Dreamcast was long gone by the time it released. This game was quickly forgotten because there were a lot of platformers back then, especially of the 'mid-tier' variety (Voodoo Vince, Vexx, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Kao the Kangaroo, and on and on). It was tough back in those days to compete with the likes of Mario, Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, Sly Cooper, etc. That didn't mean that Sphinx was a bad game -- quite the opposite! And since the genre isn't as alive as it once was, it's nice to see a forgotten gem like this brought back. While it shows its age, this is definitely the best looking version in existence. If you like the platforming genre & have never played Sphinx, I'd recommend giving it a go. It doesn't have voice acting, or even odd noises like a Banjo & Kazooie, but it doesn't need it. It's a fun game for all ages.",5,1,1,180,731,14,240,9,8,73.74,7.94,6.6,11.11

"This game brings something new to he table for Gearbox. While the art style of Battleborn will have you reminiscing of your days playing Borderlands, the game pretty much leaves all its similaritie there. It has much more in common with League of Legends or DOTA 2 than your average multiplayer FPS. The game is about unique heroes that you must master, while choosing which of their stats to increase. It is part of a wave of new games called hero shooters. However, many compare this game to Overwatch. While both are onjective based arena shooters that put you in control of a hero with their own unique weapons, stats and abilities, these games have very little in common after that. Battleborn offers the ability to customize your hero as they level up in a match, choosing which of two traits to pick each level progression. Add this to the ability to deploy turrets, stat boosting structures and drones at designated spots on the map, and you have a game that will likely not play the same each time you play. The animations are beautiful, but can be a little over the top during intense moments, making it hard to play competitively, as you lose track of what's going on around you. The game also feels as though it isn't polished enough for it to be taken seriously as a competitive online game. However, the foundation and ideas that Gearbox has laid will make this game a definitive title in this new genre as they continue to update and add content to the game. Gearbox is actively working on this title, so look forward to all the little problems being smoothed over within the next year.",4,1,0,288,1288,29,427,13,11,58.92,10.55,9.16,12.89

This game introduces characters upgrades while you play and it has a co-op campaign mode alongside it's PvP multiplayer modes.

"I've been playing NHL video games since Blades of Steel on NES, trust me, you don't want to waste your money on NHL17. I've been reporting bugs to the game developers support on twitter with video evidence and they do not respond. You can control the puck much better in NHL 16. Passing is better as well. There are less features in NHL 16, but there's also less bugs. Save your money! I've been providing feedback to the developers directly as well as multiple surveys since NHL15 and they totally missed the bar on this one. They left out important features like coaches challenge which can be a big deal when you have a bad call that costs you the game. You can see here linklink issues with the gameplay and obvious glitches that cause issues with controlling the puck and these weren't even taken during online gameplay! Invest yourself in NHL16 and say goodbye to EA Canada ever getting this one right. They don't listen to fan feedback, they get more money every year if they release a mediocre game and promise the moon and stars the following year.",1,2,6,197,846,18,275,11,8,70.56,7.87,7.8,10.82
"This game is a great leap forward for the series and probably the first time I can truly say I've enjoyed a sequel much more than an original. The story truly continues from where the first game left off, answers the questions from the first game up front and leads you into a new storylne very appropriately, while still leaving you wanting to know more about the story of the character you are playing. The controls are much improved from the first game, the combat is much better and more adaptive than the original, and the side challenges and achievements are actually worth something to your character and the storyline (not just miscellaneous fluff like the flags in the first game).",5,14,0,122,560,14,181,3,21,40.05,17.78,10.46,20.86
"This is my first time into this series, I did not play AC1. I decided to get AC2 since the story sounded interesting and everyone said 2 was way better than 1. The graphics are stunning. The cities are enormous. There are enough side missions to keep you occupied for a very long time. Or if you just want to explore the cities causing mayhem along the way, you can do that too. The storyline missions aren't just a run and gun type mission. They take planning. You can't just bust up into the place to assassinate your target and expect to survive long. This is definitely a must have game and I look forward to Revelations coming out soon.",5,4,0,122,508,9,172,10,5,75.18,5.8,6.26,7.83

"I just bought this game recently and I can't get away from it! I'm a huge fan of 'open world' or 'sandbox' style video games and this one, for me, stands close to the top!!! I love the story taking place in the late 1400's, it's a time period not usually depicted in video games and the graphic design and gameplay really give you a great and realistic feel of Italy in that time period. The storyline is excellent, great characters, beautifully written with emotional intensity. Of course combat variety really gives the game a powerful edge. And the abilty to free run and explore makes the game more accessable because you don't have to follow the story everytime you play, you can do side mission or explore the land... up to you!!! Overall, excellent game! 5 stars all the way!!! Can't wait for the next one coming soon!!! Highly recommended!",5,4,1,157,659,26,237,11,6,64.64,7.79,6.81,12.33

"Assassin's Creed 2 is a great game, and its better than anything i thought ubisoft could do. There maybe be some problems with the game in the challenge and length. I say the length because i know alot of people just try to follow the main storyline and don't try to do any of the extra events. I say the challenge because once you get every move down you basically just walk up to someone and their dead in less then a second, which i've played and seen this happen when you get surround by a group of gaurds and then like one swift move and almost everyone is taken out? It makes no sense. But overall this game is great! I would recommend this game to everyone who has an 360 or PS3.",5,3,0,137,541,9,177,7,7,77.67,7.29,5.91,10.46

It's one of the few games I've picked up recently that I had to keep playing until I finished it. The puzzle aspects of the game are challenging but not frustrating. My only slight complaint is that the controls can sometimes be annoying (I found myself flying off a building a couple times by accident), but that doesn't deter me at all.

"I was not a huge fan of the first Assassin's Creed. They got a lot of things right, but after a while it just seemed like the missions repeated themselves and before long it became kind of a chore to continue playing. So I got rid of it without ever finishing. This game is what Assassin's Creed SHOULD have been. As an independent game designer, I am consistently blown away by the care and attention that every aspect of this game has received. That's not to say that it doesn't have its faults- the opening scene, for example, is boring and unnecessary- but what it gets wrong is NOTHING compared to what it gets right. I wish all games had the polish that this one does. It's a true work of art, and I'd recommend it to anyone- whether you're a fan of the 3rd person sneak-around genre or not, this game is an awesome experience.",5,2,0,164,653,15,220,8,8,72.54,8.23,6.17,11.86
"This is an excellent game. I like it better then the first. The first was very repetitive and later in the game you could not walk 10 feet before getting attacked by the guards. This time it is so much better. First you can now bring your notoriety down so guards will not attack you all the time. You can rip down wanted posters, bribe heralds, or kill politicians. When you unlock the level in the game you can start to rebuild your family villa. The small town and home looks very dark and dingy when you get there. The more money you get from missions and treasure boxes you can take that money and put it to the up keep of your villa. This is fun to do but it is not going to affect the story if you skip it. The town will start to give you discounts on weapons, armor, etc. It will also start to generate more money for you that you will be able to collect and spend on those things. Finding assassins tombs is fun too. You will find them on the map but have to find the secret entrance and then have to go through the building or tomb to find the resting place of the assassin. Finding all of these will allow you to unlock Altair's armor from the first game. These are just a few of the great things about the game. I recommend picking it up. Just a great story game that I am still working on to finish.",4,2,0,260,1031,9,329,18,5,85.12,4.97,5.47,7.16

I watched a few trailers and i was amazed by the new and improved things you can do. I bought it yesterday the day it came out and was a little surprised. As soon as you start the game there is ACTION. What surprised me was you got to battle outside the animus with Desmond. That was awesome. I don't want to give anymore details you definately have to play it yourself. It's the best!!!!!",5,2,0,103,396,7,138,9,3,81.87,4.68,4.22,7.3

This game is even better than the first there are a few flaws in the game but they arent even noticable for the average gamer. The story is compelling and original the missions are always fun and challenging, but the graphics and the gameplay are what makes the game top notch. Seriously the best part is running on rooftops. its not like prince of persia where the running/jumping mechanics are tediouos and annoying. THis game is just a lot of fun! and it takes a very long time to get old. You have to play it just to try it out, but buy the first one first it only takes about 7 hours to beat and then you can start on this one!

"Assassin's Creed II is a huge step up from the first game. It gets rid of the required monotonous gameplay aspects and gives some more variation. I felt the animations and voice acting were a step above the last game and the beginning tutorial sequences and storyline helped to get you more intertwined with Ezio and his motivations. The fighting system is updated a bit to include various weapons that you can use - whether you bring them to the fight or steal your opponents weapons. However, the general rule of waiting and countering to kill your enemies still holds true in this game. It can get a little old, but it's still good time.",5,1,0,116,515,18,173,6,10,61.04,9.55,8.77,13.94
"If you liked the first AC game don't even finish reading this review - go out and buy ACII right now! In all seriousness this game takes everything that Assassin's Creed did well and made it better, then took everything that the first game fell short on and went well above and beyond the improvements necessary. The result is a stunningly beautiful game that is easy to pick up and get completely and totally addicted to. The story is very compelling in ACII, and your character is a bit more robust. The voice acting is really quite good, and the cut scenes are even better than in the first. Apart from looks the game delivers on several other levels, though. The controls have been refined from the first game, the combat is a bit more challenging, and the environment seems to be more interactive and open. In addition you can finally get in the water without desynchronizing! Simply following the storyline provides many hours of gameplay, but all the extras are what makes this game well worth the purchase. Much like in the first game you have items to find, but there are also puzzles you can solve to unravel part of the mystery behind Abstergo, and even property management that increases your income. If you invest enough effort into the property at the offset money becomes no object and you'll always have the best weapons and armor available.",5,1,0,241,1095,33,365,11,11,56.47,10.83,9.57,14.24

"my personal number one game of the year, I will play CoD MW2 for a week hardcore, then set it aside to destroy this game, maybe even twice. They have gotten rid of the flags, with is both good and bad IMO, since i still haven't found all of them in the first game, even after 4 play throughs. as far as repetitive, the first really wasn't that bad compared to what some say, but this one has been opened up in so many ways that it will be one big sandbox to get lost in. PS, Ezio can swim, steal weapons and kill with them, grab people while hanging on a ledge and throw them off, use a new barter system to buy weapons and upgrades instead of earn them, and can use a gun, and so much more... did i mention that he is best friends with Leonardo Da Vinci? geepers I am pumped... now I wont be able to sleep tonight because of all the adrenaline... try it for yourself, if you hated the first or heard bad things, give the second one a try, they listened to the customers and revamped it... it will be amazing.",5,1,0,202,774,10,260,9,8,75.16,8.35,5.41,10.96

The game's best moments are spent negotiating clever environmental puzzles and sneaking stealthily around corridors to deftly fell bad guys; unfortunately there's surprisingly little of that sort of thing for a game about an agile assassin.

"Overall after playing about 100+ games so far, this is probably the best iteration of MLB The Show in many years. There still is the obvious and frequently frustrating/annoying/maddening thing with the CPU taking control of the gameplay in any game, where human input doesn't matter for variable periods of time (see any of my past yearly reviews for an expanded comment about this- ALL sports videogames suffer from this, too), but so far, it seems to be a bit less than last year- and I have found that it can be corrected by simply saving the game at the point when you see you are no longer in control, and then restart it again at that point- this seems to 'reset' the gameplay mechanism, and on restarting, you might get a fair shot at the gameplay results. The 9th inning CPU comeback mechanism is still alive and well, BTW. This is what I was referring to above, regarding outcomes for pitching, hitting, etc, by the human player. Also often referred to as gameplay 'scripting', and it remains the single main issue, IMO, that makes this game less than a 5-star game.

I can't speak to how much better the graphics are since I have no comparison, but it is a very pretty game. However, it's the gameplay that matters the most, and this game is nearly perfect! The controls are tight, and the gameplay mechanics don't get old too quickly. There are quite a few quick time events which I've never been fond of, but they're easily overlooked considering how fun the rest of the game is. I love action/adventure games with puzzles and this is all of that. Definitely worth buying!",5,1,0,137,554,12,183,9,6,78.38,6.11,6.03,9.59

I did not expect to get into this game the way that I did, but I am hooked. This is the best game I've played in a while and the graphics are glorious. Awesome gameplay as well. There's lots or action and exploration. Gameplay is smooth as well. I absolutely cannot wait for a sequel to this. I believe it will be Rise of the Tomb Raider and I have high expectations and cannot wait! I highly recommend this game to anyone considering it.

"Tomb Raider wears its influences on its sleeve. If I was explaining how Tomb Raider plays to someone that hasnt been following the game, Id say its the beautiful love child of Uncharted and the Batman Arkham titles. It takes the smooth platforming and gunplay of Naughty Dogs series and mixes it with the quasi open-world exploration and equipment upgrade elements from Rocksteadys titles. But to say Tomb Raider is just a by-the-numbers amalgam of those two popular franchises is doing the game a huge disservice. Tomb Raider manages to take the best elements from those brands and mix them together so well that the resulting concoction feels like something wholly fresh and original.

The campaign is very lackluster though, and the fighting system is not very deep at all. Combos are EXTREMELY limited and can make for some pretty boring matches even at high tier matchups. I dont think the game is worth the full 60 dollar price tag, but that doesnt mean you cant enjoy it.

"The game is a lot of fun. There are some really nice customizations for characters; in fact you can have multiple characters to play through as. The game adds some new characters to the SAO Universe to join you on your unique journey. There are also tons of familiar faces that can join you on quests and boss fights anytime in the game. There are squad controls as well to help you control how your squad reacts in battle. The story is very unique. It is separate from the SAO canon (Anime) But it is a lot of fun and the story is really good so far. The game's dungeons are fairly challenging as well. Which makes it more fun. The game is Subbed into English but there is no English dubbed version. That is very important to most. As far as I know they will always speak Japanese in the game and the subtitles are English which isn't a huge deal and you get used too it. If you watch anime you probably are used to it. The AI Characters are a little off at times but they do definitely help you clear enemies and bosses. What's extra cool is each companion is different; So you can mix it up when fighting different bosses cause each one differs in skills and weapons. There is also a fairly decent size of weapon selections as well. Also Online Boss fighting mode and PVP Boss fights. Its pretty cool. Overall I really enjoy the game as I am a SAO fan already.

He is leaning how to control the game and there arent any real ways to die or get stuck in the game. There is no platinum trophy which is a bit odd for a full priced retail game. I figured Id at least get an east platinum out of it. The only other thing that struck me as odd about the game is that Ryder is the only voice in the game: the pups dont talk. Also they dont seem to use the licensed music from the show, some kind of Muzak appropriation soundtrack.

The music is mesmerizing, with every song having a unique feel and fitting perfectly with each area that you explore. Boss fights are exciting and memorable. I really loved being able to change into different forms, each with their own set of special abilities. The equipment and shop system are great as well. There are secrets hidden everywhere and many areas you can't access right away when you first come across them. This aspect feels very similar to the Metroid games (a huge plus). Also worth noting is the inclusion of an actual instruction manual and cool stickers with the game itself. I'm glad that there are still companies that put effort into their physical releases. If you are ready for something both new and old, you definitely can't go wrong with Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom!",5,1,0,170,781,22,256,12,8,65.06,7.7,9.12,10.84
"This game is hard but totally worth the learning curve. You control a girl who uses a fishing rod to get around. Think the Legend of Zelda hookshot, but bouncier. It's a platformer that's physics based, you need to let out slack on your fishing rod to bounce and get the momentum to propel yourself higher. Then release to launch yourself higher in the stage. The graphics are the only drawback. The game itself doesn't look like the cover, it's mostly cartoony pixelated environments. This game is hard and challenging so be prepared.

You play as Kawase as you go and do some deliveries or item searching in various parts of the town.

Overall I am impressed with how well 704 Games listened to fans, I didn't play NASCAR Heat Evolution so I really can't say firsthand how much the game has improved, but from what friends have told me and things I've read/watched the game is heading in the right direction.

"These last few years have seen the re-release of the fan-favorite Kingdom Hearts series. Possibly as small recompense that the series proper hasnt been given another true installment in over a decade and thus skipped over this entire last generation of major home console, these games are bundled Remastered versions of PS2/PSP classics. The graphical enhancements are notable, but are they worth the full purchase? Are these not the same games weve already played? For us Americans, yes and no. You see, these are the Final Mix versions of these games, which until these releases, have never seen the light of day on Western shores, having previously been Japan exclusives. So then, there are some elements of these games that are certain to have never been experienced by most American games. So what do these changes add? What do they take away? Do they warrant the new purchase price and time investment? Since most of us have already played the original version of this game, Ill focus on the new version for this review. Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Fix does a lot of what Kingdom Hearts Final Mix did. Nearly all basic Heartless get a palate swap, some more visually appealing or sensible than others, but still essentially the same. There are additional cutscenes, fully voiced in English, which explore more of the goings-on with the games antagonists, Organization XIII, and fill-in a few more gaps between this sequel and the first installment. They fill time mostly well, although some drag out longer than they are welcome. Another minor addition is a new puzzle sidequest. Simple in its execution, there are several crown-shaped piece scattered around the worlds. They are not hard to find, but somewhat difficult to acquire, with most requiring Sora to max out his Drive Abilities. Its a nice distractive additional quest for the collector types. Sora also gets an additional Drive Form, Limit Form. His clothes resemble the color scheme he had in the last game, and he can preform the special Limit abilities he could last game. Because they take the place of Magic Commands and can be difficult to time right and be blocked, they are not very useful outside of being the experience needed to level up this Form. Still, the sheer power of this Forms combo finishing moves make this Form very valuable in combat, especially since Sora can trigger it alone without any allies. There are new synthesis materials that are quite powerful, but difficult to obtain. Most come from a new section of the game, the Cavern of Remembrance, in Hollow Bastion/Radiant Garden. In it, there are new Heartless, palate swaps of other Heartless that are much stronger than their counterparts. They drop the new synthesis type materials, Remembrance, and some strong weapons for Donald and Goofy. They are not earned lightly, but they do provide a good challenge and excellent means of grinding high levels. There is also another group of additional special Heartless, called Mushroom XIII. As you could guess, they resemble the members of Organization XIII. They are scattered throughout the Worlds, and their powers faintly resemble their Organization counterparts. They are the only source for another synthesis material needed for unique items, Tranquility, and they drop extra staves and shields for Donald and Goofy, but they are mostly too weak to be effective. And sadly, these new enemies are where the game loses some of its traction: the difficulty. Each of these encounters plays like a mini-game, and the challenges you are expected to complete range from doable if you know how to downright nigh-impossible. Trying over and over again, with no apparent progress can suck some of the fun out of the game and replace it with frustration. This trend continues to an even greater extent with the final addition the Final Mix makes: extra boss fights. And theres a LOT of them. There are fights against Absent Silhouettes, rematches against the Organization XIII members defeated during the mid-quel Chain of Memories, with reworked mechanics to include KH2s battle system. These can be very challenging, particularly at lower levels. There is also an additional fight with Roxas toward the end of game, replacing what was just a cutscene before. At the end of the Cavern of Remembrance is the Garden of Remembrance, where Sora can fight Data Rematches against the greatly power-up members of Organization XIII. These fights are mostly identical to their previous encounters, but their stats are maxed out and some condition mechanics are made much harder. And to top it all off, there is after-game fight with a foe called Lingering Will, to set the stage for Birth By Sleep. His combos are unbreakable, his Strength, Defense, and HP enormous, and he can lock Commands. These fights can be downright insane, impossible to beat at lower levels, and possibly even difficulties. They are extremely trying on even the lowest game difficulty setting, to say nothing of Normal or Proud Mode. This kind of difficultly greatly harms the game in my opinion, require ridiculous amounts of practice, grinding, and farming to be able to complete for 100% game completion. Victory seems to come more from luck than perseverance, and thats not a good point in my book. In sum, Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix is still a phenomenally good game, in terms of story, gameplay, battle mechanics, and character. While the new edition adds much to this release, it can suffer a bit from much higher difficulty. Sure, its all optional in theory, but not for us completionists. A new purchase is easily warranted for the die-hard fans of the series, but for those who might want to try it out, it may be better to wait for a price drop.

"I have always been a fan of the Kingdom Hearts series. I've played each and everyone of them. I slept countless hours on Kingdom Hearts 2 when it was released on PS2, and ever since a final mix version was created from it, I've been wishing it to be translated in English. Birth By Sleep on the PSP was one of my most favorite Kingdom Hearts. It was a day one purchase for me. I had beaten multiple times. Now, let's talk about the 2.5 Remix. KINGDOM HEARTS 2 FINAL MIX: THE GOOD: At the base this is still the Kingdom Hearts 2 we grew up with on Ps2, but there has been a lot of new editions since this is the final mix version. Tons of new bosses, new abilities, new weapons, items, and Sora even receives a handy new drive form that pays homage to the first Kingdom Hearts. This being a HD remastered, Square Enix really outdid themselves in some area. The music tracks for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix have all have been completely re-orchestrated to one of the most dynamic soundtracks I have ever heard. The upgrade in SOME textures really are great. The BAD: Some texture weren't really changed. (building and some armor and other details in textures) With everything else looking so nice and top notch, it is hard not to notice the textures that weren't changed at all. Something else, (not a big deal) the loading times for drive forms are a bit..timely sometimes. Not a big deal. KINGDOM HEARTS BIRTH BY SLEEP FINAL MIX: This HD version of Birth By Sleep is a great Upgrade from it's psp original. I'm not going to be as hard on it about the textures as I was with 2, because Square came a long way with Birth By Sleep HD Remastered compared to the Psp's original textures. As for the Final Mix version, a ton of new bosses, mirage arena events, new commands, new weapons, items, and even a 'Secret' story episode has been added. The BAD: Now, you noticed I didn't talk much about the Remastered upgrades? Because outside of the textures, there really aren't much. They kept the original music tracks with the exception of 'Dismiss' and 'Keyblade Graveyard'. I wished they would've redone them as well. I came to my attention when I was listening to the 2.5 soundtracks, and the only tracks it contained from Birth By Sleep were to two I mentioned earlier. The reason is: Those were the only two tracks they redid. Not a big deal, but I noticed it. The only reason it's worth mentioning: They did it for Kingdom hearts 2 why not keep the quality consistent and do the same for Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep? As for the camera, it helped me when I set the Left/Right Camera to inverted. This sets the L3 to L=L and R=R direction whereas the original settings were L=R and R=L. BottomLine: Other than those minor issues this is well worth for the forty bucks I paid for it. If you played 1.5 Remix and loved it, than you will love this one even more. If you hated it, the upgrades and changes in Kingdom Hearts 2 will make you love it. If you're reading this review now and are curious about buying this game, DO IT. And if you haven't played the 1.5 remix, there's a collector edition that includes both the 2.5 and 1.5 Remixes and the soundtracks and art of them both. If you really don't want to shell out 90 bucks then you can always just purchase the standard edition of them which totals to about 60 bucks. 2.5 = 39.99 1.5 = 19.99 I hope this helped your decision.",5,3,2,658,2633,54,896,47,5,77.43,5.94,5.61,8.88

"Review for Kingdom Hearts 2 Pros: Expanded levels- KH2 expands the areas of worlds that were in the previous KH. There are also new worlds to choose from. The music- The music is KH2 is amazing. Many of the songs are taken from their respective movie, such as This Is Halloween, and are blended in with the game to deliver a fun atmosphere. Gameplay-The gameplay can be seen as very simple or very complex. To someone who just wants to play he/she can play through by simply mashing buttons, however the game offers a variety of tools that can make the game more suitable for the more advanced player. There are spells, summons, special attacks, tram attacks, etc. The best thing about is that they are not difficult to perform. It all depends on the playing style of the gamer. Visuals- The graphics in this game were nicely retouched, complimenting the Disney/Final Fantasy theme. Cons: Cutscenes-The cutscenes in this game seemed a little excessive, especially in the beginning. Telling a story is not a problem but the game would not allow the player to immerse his/herself in the fame without interrupting them with a cutscene. They were nice to look at but should have been a little less. Gameplay- As stated before the game can be played through by button mashing. The problem with with this is that players run the risk of playing a game that extremely repetitive. Without using the extra tools the game will seem bland and boring. Story-The KH story is a very complex one to understand. The die hard KH fan will be more willing to explore and try and understand what the true purpose of the story was. For the casual player, however, the story would just seem complicated and end up not making sense. It does retell some parts of the previous games but it is still recommended to play the other games first, if you are interested in the story. Overall Kingdom Hearts II is a fun and complex game that will appeal to both hardcore and casual gamers. There are obviously more pros and cons to this game but I felt these were my biggest concerns. I believe people should try this game as it is very well put together.",4,0,2,385,1698,39,553,23,8,68.33,7.89,8.36,10.75

"The Kingdom Hearts series was once all the rage, until an erratic release schedule pushed the 3rd, and final, game in the series back almost a decade. This game is meant to bridge the gap for those new to the series. For vets, like myself, there's a ton more content than the original KH II game that came out so many years ago on the PS2. It's wonderful, and the remake of the PSP game, Birth by Sleep, adds alot more content to an already packed game. Buy it and you won't be sorry.",5,0,2,97,375,5,126,5,7,77.25,7.3,5.41,9.82

"MK11 boasts great and deep fighting mechanics which take the best from previous MK installments and borrow some from other popular fighting franchises. Audio and visuals are top notch with sharp play controls. There are lots of single player and multiplayer options. The gear system is a bit broken, with high (border line) unfair AI in the Towers of Time and steeply prices krypt items which require ample grinding to unlock. However the developer is said to be patching this.",4,2,0,80,390,9,121,5,10,62.64,8.5,11.01,10.9
"Mortal Kombat 11's variation system is rather extensive and each character has hundreds of combinations of gear pieces that can be equipped (masks, weapons, costumes/skins, etc.). However, all of these items (even the basic variation icons) are locked away either inside the Krypt or the Towers of Time. This is where the issues begin to get out of hand. The Krypt is just a large lootbox mode disguised as a third-person adventure game. The boxes inside the Krypt are randomly generated for each user and all cost such a high amount of coins to unlock/open, in contrast to the very small amount of coins that are earned from playing the game itself. This means it will take hundreds of hours to unlock all the gear for your favorite character and will take thousands of hours to get them for the entire roster. To make things even worse, rewards cannot be earned if the game is being played offline, and it requires internet in order to validate your rewards. So, if you were looking to play the game 100% offline, that is not a possibility. I would recommend passing on the game and picking up MK XL instead, as that game can be found for relatively cheap on either the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 and it includes all of the characters (on disc) along with all of the other DLC without any need to grind it hurts Ive already paid 100$ for this and they still want more never again.",3,2,0,254,1100,22,361,10,12,60.82,11.09,8.5,13.62

"Metro has been a surprising blast for me to play. The story and nature of the game had me immediately glued to the game - I played for 4 hours straight on my first try. The pacing, dialogue, and setting are that good. It also has a bit of a horror element to it, but not an uncomfortable amount - I was sweating from the tension and eerie moments, but was never truly scared (I bought this game for the story and shooter gameplay). Ultimately, I was expecting the game to be good, but it exceeded these expectations.

"I waited for this game to drop down to 25$ to pick it up, and honestly It was far more than worth it. I loved the first metro when I got it on PC and never got last light until this redux'd version. Last light met my expectations of a metro game and introduced more mechanics and elements expanding on the original. But we are here to talk about the redux, not just last light. For those who played the original metro, this redux'd version plays very similar to it, but with a few notable changes. these changes are minor cosmetic changes such as picking up all the supplies in a stash instead of each piece individually. The most disappointing change was the removal of the armor system from 2033 in the redux. this isn't a big deal, but I was hoping more for a game updated visually without touching the game's mechanics. Because there is no stealth suit or heavy armor the stealth plays more closely to last light and the health i can not tell for sure, but I know you can not have the same protection as heavy armor. For those who have never played the metro series, this game is not for everyone. Focusing on the combat, you have the choice of a stealth approach or all out firefights. supplies can be little and far in between depending on what difficulty you play on. The shooting is solid and satisfying as is the bits of chatter you will hear between soldiers as you are sneaking around them. Overall I love this game and is an instant favorite for those into stealthy FPS games that limit your resources.",5,1,0,285,1207,27,400,14,9,67.44,8.91,7.65,11.93

They do not react to gunfire, don't react to receiving damage, and honestly don't feel right... They have a very stale feel to them, which translates quickly to the gamer...

I think it would be nice if they can make the game to where it has an easy mode in which case the settings for each car would be already set so you could control the cars a lot easier, and for people who wanna get into setting up the cars and mess with the settings they can, and make it a hard mode or something to that nature.

"I'm not a fan of the mainline Dragon Quest series, but I wanted to try out a game with this style of combat. I really liked how colorful this game is and the great variety of enemies. This game is actually a lot of fun. In addition to fighting hordes of monsters in the main story, there are a lot of interesting side quests. The main story itself is very generic, but still interesting enough, most of the playable characters are cameos from the main Dragon Quest Series (there are 4 original ones, so far), but they are all interesting and quirky. The characters have a lot of variety of weapons and move sets, and the two main characters can change their vocations to give them access to new weapons. The only main issue with this game is that it can become repetitive quickly. Personally I can only play it in short bursts. However, the game counters this by giving you new characters with new weapons and combos, and also by adding new areas and enemies. All in all a very fun experience, when you are in the mood for fast pace action that is light on the story.",4,1,0,200,846,23,291,10,9,63.44,9.38,7.59,12.6

"This game is not as stiff and rigid as it looked like during Tokyo Game Show. That was a huge turn off for a lot of people and they definitely smoothed things out. I have to say that first in case people still have that in their heads. +You. Can. Pet. The. Dog. Whenever you want. Plus you get an achievement for doing it so many times. :D +Really interesting story plot where you go between Purgatory and Real life. Sadly the IRL segment is limited to choosing where to go next and healing yourself. +Beautiful art. From characters to scenery, they went all out with this aesthetic and it Works. +Crafting is there to power up your equipment using what you find. +Costumes to unlock. The Day One version gives you 2 from the start as a bonus start. +Fascinating mechanic of carrying the regrets of monsters you kill. If you let too many thoughts build up you start to suffer so staying clean is key. Cleaning yourself also gives you crafting items so it's a win win. +Endless Dashing. I didn't see a limit--or didn't notice one--while playing. Mostly dashed through dungeons in record times since walking/running is far slower. Honestly I felt like a speedrunner mapping out the best dash routes. +/- Voice acting. I'm really on the fence on this one. Some of the characters are really well done and felt Triple A quality. Nailing the small nuances of their character and bringing life. Then there's some that are good but don't quite reach that level. And there's some here and there that are not impressive at all. It's honestly a mixed bag. You can hear them giving it their best, but they don't quite resonate. -RNG drops. Crafting needs drops from enemies more than anything else. A dungeon run could get you anywhere from 12 of what you need to only 3. It's all luck. -Enemy designs. For the most part, bosses and rare enemies definitely stand out and have that high level of polish. But for the majority of enemies, they're quite simple. They do fit the game world without question, they're just very same-y. Would I suggest this? I would simply from the art direction alone. It's genuinely really pretty to look at. Architecture, colors, fashion, it's all lovely. The RNG and mixed voice actors are the main reason for going 4 stars instead of 5.",4,4,0,420,1767,38,583,45,4,79.93,4.43,5.77,7.35

Skate 3 - Friends said it was great and it looked good. I wasnt sure if I wanted it or not but I did get it and im glad i made that decision! I love the game and at the time I got it I understood the way the map (i guess you would call it that) worked. It was so much easier to complete missions/do tricks or compete in events.
