Jimbro, ^863424218^112^18^"This is the model phone my employer has provided as a work phone. I have always liked the phone and I finally upgraded my Tracfone. So glad I did."^5^August 19, 2018
iPhone6s, ^863424218^78^39^"It's an iPhone it it's amazing...plus it was a great deal at the right price."^4^March 11, 2018
Gmom, ^863424218^67^0^"Purchased about a month ago. Had been looking at used ones and also looking at the phone on this website. One day I noticed the price had gone down. I took advantage of the price. I have an iPod so knew a bit about the working of iPhone but still takes a little bit of a learning curve (had an Android previously). Really like the phone and the features that it has. If you are on the fence try it. The activation on the website was flawless. No problems at all and very easy."^5^March 24, 2019
teacherb, ^863424218^50^3^"Have only had the phone a few weeks, so am still figuring out what it can do, but so far I love it. It takes very good pictures, a main reason I purchased it. I love being able to use iMessage with my iPhone-toting son and save paying for texts. I also receive photos of my grandchildren that way with such ease. The size and feel of the phone are just right, after buying an inexpensive clear cover for it."^5^February 14, 2019
Maryo, ^863424218^47^0^"I've only had the phone for several weeks. After having an android, the iphone took a little bit of getting used to. The phone has a lot of storage and features that I would probably never use, as I am  'tech challenged'.  The screen is a nice size and I was pleased that the keyboard was a little larger and much easier to use. The battery life seems to be long. The support I was given by TracFone for setting everything up was superb. So to date, I'd give this phone 5 stars."^5^May 8, 2019
Alexis, ^863424218^44^20^"I got this phone in June and I've had it science. The phone is very rugged and it looks beautiful. It works amazing to. Over all I highly recommend this iPhone."^5^September 8, 2018
Lovely77, ^863424218^31^3^"I bought this phone a couple weeks ago. I'm impressed! I previously had an iPhone 6, so this was a nice upgrade. The camera is amazing, the phone is fast, it works so smoothly. I have no complaints! This is still a good phone in 2019. And I'm in love with the rose gold color! I'm glad I made this purchase."^5^April 14, 2019

iPhone 6s customer, ^863424218^5^0^"The phone is fine except for the text messages. It only works properly when connected to WiFi or by using data.

BeOutside, ^863424218^1^0^"Other reviews said StraighTalk customer service was aweful, so I avoided it. I used my desktop to do the activation. My cell number was ported over almost immediately. The StraighTalk site accepted the code from the back of the plan card, and I signed up for automatic renewal with no issues. This is my first iPhone so I'm getting used to the differences from my previous androids. Cellular coverage seems comparable at this point (3 days in). I'm traveling this week so I will get to see how it really compares. So far it looks like I will gt twice as much data (2 GB vs 1 GB) for almost $20 less per month. Now to see how long Apple supports the 6S before turning it into a paperweight."^5^July 3, 2018
Nan777, ^863424218^1^1^"I chose to get this phone because I have been using an iPad for several years and love it.  The phone came and was so easy for me because it is basically the same as the iPad.  It is a great phone"^5^July 26, 2019
Sparky, ^863424218^1^0^"The phone is great as is the price, but understand that you will
have to set it up yourself.  The Apple IPhone store in Naperville,
IL would not help us in any way.  We drove over 1 1/2 hours to get there and they turned us away at the door because we did not buy the phone from them and we were not using one of the
top 4 providers.  We got it done with Apple ICare on the phone, but took over 3 hours.  Setting up the Straight Talk was fine, no problems.  This is my first Smart Phone (I'm 68) and I really like it.  My wife has the same phone (6s) and she is helping me.  So far so good."^5^July 12, 2018
Patty, ^981575517^1^0^"This casing is so slick that it is harder to hold than melting ice. I have already had to replace my first one. The camera is okay. The volume button on the side makes it easy to accidentally turn volume down even during calls trying to hang on to the phone. The price is good but if you aren't going to put a holder on it. You might want to rethink. Insure though."^3^March 18, 2019
Household6, ^990814292^30^0^"Quick Wireless is the worst choice to buy from! The item description says their iPhones are unlocked and come with a charger and USB.  This is false!  NO charger. NO USB, nothing! When I put my SIM card in the phone,  it would not work. I went to the Apple Store and was told the phone was still locked by Sprint. The phone also had some scratches on it and a bright spot on the screen that would not display.  I have sent back the iPhone,  I have no idea how long it will take to get my money back! Don't make the same mistake; DO NOT buy from this company!!!"^1^September 19, 2017

SenoritaC, ^45111496^172^65^"Learned the hard way that the $45 plan I choose was more than I needed. Very rarely use the call side of the plan. Use 99% of the time for texts. SO I bought a $30 plan - found that I am NOT allowed to change the plan. ST added the $30 plan and I lost a week of service.

To explain - $45.00 bought 30 days of full service. Tried to change the plan - they added the card and I got only 21 days of full service. I was told that I would have to purchase a totally new ST service and change the number in order to have a $30.. plan.

Voice mail recordings are always static and are not always clear.

Customer service is poor. I have called in a few times for help. When the rep is done with the task they have just hung up. This caused me to have to call back, hold through the queue and then ask for help again for the other questions I needed hello with.

When you want to add a pre-paid card in reserve - you must call or chat in.

I need a second phone for my crafting business - I defiantly will NOT be buying that service with Straight Talk."^2^December 8, 2015
CrazyBirdman, ^45111496^162^27^"I have been a Straight Talk customer for several years & have been fairly satisfied with them. In October 2014 I bought a Samsung Galaxy S4. I was offered the 'Easy Exchange' warranty program & I bought it. January 14th 2016 my phone failed. I reported the phone was broke & they sent me a prepaid FedEx envelope which took about four days to get. I also had to pay a $49.00 deductible. I sent the phone back as instructed. It is now February 1st & I still don't have a replacement phone. Not only do I not have a phone, Straight Talk isn't sure when my replacement phone will be shipped. I have been without a phone for over two weeks with no real idea of when I will get a phone. THE 'EASY EXCHANGE' PROGRAM IS A JOKE. Once I get a new phone I will be dropping Straight Talk & going with a carrier that will let me bring my own phone."^1^February 1, 2016
Devlinlarvae, ^45111496^133^11^"I love the Straight Talk plan so I would have given it 5 stars, but buying it on line would have been a huge irritation if I hadn't already read the other reviews that said this same thing: THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS THAT TELL YOU TO PRINT YOUR ORDER TO GET THE PIN!!!!!!! That is so stupid. You buy it on line, wait about an hour and then they send you your digital purchase by email. What they do not tell you is that you have to now print it out to get the actual PIN number that you need. You do not get it in the email like you would assume so if you are not by a printer it is pointless to buy it on line. Other than that it was great."^3^June 6, 2016
Cuteypye26, ^45111496^70^12^"This company used to have a better deal than any of the other carriers, until recently. They decided to stop giving $5 off for auto-refill and only give $1 now. Their $45 plan now comes out to almost $50 after taxes, and that's with auto-pay! I remember when the $45 plan used to be a little over $46 with taxes and auto-pay.  Another drawback to this company that I just found out tonight, is if you want to jump ship and take your number with you to another company, your new cell phone carrier pretty much has to plead and negotiate with Straight Talk to let them have your number !  My new carrier spent most of this evening trying to get Straight Talk to give up my number so that it can be ported.  Here it is 3 hrs later and Straight Talk still hasn't held their end of the bargain! My new carrier also let me in on that Straight Talk has a history of doing this to customers that want to discontinue service with them. My suggestion to anyone wanting to try this company, you can do better! 
-There are companies that have hot spots and you can tether your phone to use it. Straight Talk doesn't let you tether your phone.
-Also, for $50 you at least 8 gb of data with some other cell phone carriers,whereas it's $49 with taxes for Straight Talk's $45 plan and you only get 5 gb of data."^1^December 2, 2016
Alan, ^45111496^59^19^"Straight Talk's service is good. I've only had a few minor problems. The biggest was when I was driving through South Dakota and my phone went off completely and it took nearly two hours to talk to someone who knew how to fix it. I've also ordered a refurbished phone from them on the straight talk site (much cheaper than on here from what I've seen). I had to buy an extra month of minutes though - even though I've been a customer for years and am enrolled in the auto-renew program. The package was delivered via FedEx 3-day shipping that took over a week to get because Straight Talk put the wrong address on the box. The ordeal of explaining how I even figured that out would take too long to write. After I finally got it, the phone was in a big box with one medium sized bag of air, with the smaller box the phone was in bouncing around. If you never had to deal with straight talk you are blessed. Their service isn't bad though (from my experience)."^1^March 14, 2017
CNoons, ^45111496^55^14^"Customer service is absolutely horrible. They read from a script and just repeat everything until you want to give up and end the call. I would NOT recommend Straight talk to anyone unless you have no other option. Reading through reviews, this is a common occurrence and they obviously don't care how horrible their customer service is.
Just know when you sign up with Straight talk you will NOT be happy with the customer service if you ever run into an issue and you will most likely end your conversation with them and not be happy with the outcome either."^1^November 16, 2016
cassowary, ^45111496^55^2^"Walmart should include some instructions on how to use this e-card. It only took me about an hour to figure out you have to 'print' it to see the pin number."^5^March 18, 2016
RaspMeringue, ^45111496^53^12^"We've been using Straight Talk for years now and I have never been more frustrated with them until this situation occurred. We were on the last day of our service and both our phones are on the same days of service. My phone was still working and as far as we were aware so was my SO's but it had died so we just refilled them as usual. However, in the time my SO's phone was dead, they deactivated it a gave away his phone number. It had only been HOURS maybe that it was deactivated and they gave away the phone number he had been using for years! This is only double frustrating as he's also got job app he just sent out with his 'old' phone number because they just effing give away your phone number the second your phone deactivates apparently. I'm holding back my swearing but I'm absolutely livid about this. That is so ridiculous. I will be switching phone carriers because of this and will never recommend StraightTalk to anyone. Their customer service has been a nightmare too, every time we've had to deal with them through the years. I'm just done and that was the straw that broke the camel's back!"^1^February 19, 2017
Clareysgirl1, ^45111496^52^13^"I got so tired of paying ridiculous money for spotty or nonexistent service and decided to switch to straight talk after hearing from others how great it worked. I now get much better service and the same unlimited options I had before for a fraction of the cost and I couldn't be happier. I have travelled across the country this summer and had no problems with signal. You do have to remember to load a new calling card to your account every month but you get reminders well in advance. I found that it is a few dollars cheaper to buy them in store rather than the auto delivery on Straight Talks website even though  that is more convenient. Great service for far less money - a no brainer."^5^August 18, 2016
Vick, ^45111496^49^6^"I had been on auto refill . My debit card got compromised. I called in ahead of time and told them my new card number.  They started me over as a new auto refill customer.  Now the fee is higher monthly .  The way I found out is through my notification on phone when auto refill went through later and bill was higher.  I called and explain to them and they didn't change it back. I Canceled and currently looking for another plan."^2^November 13, 2016
bummed, ^45111496^46^11^"all i was asked before i purchased straight talk service and a phone was if it worked in my zip code, i put in the zip and was told, Congratulations, it works in your zip code. i have never been able to complete a phone call without dropping the call and do not even need this $45 unlimited data plan.  i use my wi-fi at work and home and dont even try the data on straight talk because i know it will not work.  How about a cheaper plan with just texting since that is all that works, even though it just sits there 'sending' for a few minutes and then i have to 'retry' after that.  hopefully after this months bill is up, i can go with someone else and dont try and tell me to contact straight talk, when i talked to them, they said first of all, make sure you have 3 bars!  3 bars, why didnt you say that to begin with instead of just telling me that 'Congratulations' it will work in your zip code."^2^February 22, 2017
Tara, ^45111496^44^7^"Love the service, picks up everywhere and is economical. The process of ordering online is NOT 'hassle-free'. Unfortunately the time delay of 24-48 hours especially if your item gets put on 'hold' to make sure not fraud is not easy. Even after you call in to verify it's still delayed. I would recommend buying a couple days before you actually need in order for the delay not to affect you. I buy this every month and go through the exact same thing every month. You would think they would know it's me based on my ip address and same product every month."^4^December 29, 2015
CandleChick, ^45111496^42^8^"I've only been using the Straight Talk service for two months as I write this, but I haven't had any issues with the service thus far. I save quite a bit of money every month on my phone bill and I haven't noticed any difference between Straight Talk and my previous 'big name' brand carrier. I think the only downside to purchasing the plans via e-mail would be the amount of time it takes to get it delivered to your e-mail (around 4 hours), BUT if you purchase the plan in advance and not wait until the last minute, it's not a big deal."^4^February 9, 2016
MGinNY, ^45111496^36^14^"I was a customer of straight talk for over 5 years.  Making and receiving phone calls is fine.  However everything else is pretty bad.  It is exceedingly difficult to get any customer service, and when you can finally talk to a person (if you can find a way to do so) they are not knowledgeable or helpful.  I never had a decent data connection (and I hardly used the data) but for the occasional email or map when I didn't have wifi it never worked well in any area for the entire time I had service.  They will also not unlock the phone I paid for outright and told me that I signed the end user agreement so I can't use that phone to take to another provider.  Now switched to another prepaid plan - paying the same and have data connection just fine.  There are much better prepaid options out there now."^1^June 23, 2017

I received the email about 10 mins after paying. Didn't have to print nothing, just went to print preview to view the PIN."^5^June 28, 2016

Kristin, ^45111496^25^4^"After confirming with three seperate StraightTalk representatives, I purchased a Bring Your Own Phone Activation Kit, which includes this $45 plan, for my iPad Pro. Literally four hours on the phone with them later, they determined that the kit will not work with the device after all. To get a refund has, so far, required two more hours on the phone with them, and they are now asking me to drive to the post office (about 45 minutes round trip for me) and pay postage myself to mail the kit to their Florida office. This hassle is to correct their mistake and their misinformation. I seriously doubt I will ultimately receive a refund, and my 6 hours of time is gone forever. StraightTalk is terrible. Do consider other options instead."^1^April 6, 2017

Dorteto, ^45111496^18^6^"Worst customer service ever, got package two Saturdays ago and just getting service today. Been getting the run around and transferred left and right. Made a complaint and asked if I could get a few comped days for the trouble of not having a phone for two weeks. Not only did they not give me any comped time they tried only giving me 20 days of service instead of the month I paid for. Finally got the 30 days after arguing I haven't used any days. A rep told me sorry for the inconvenience and the girl I was dealing with probably didn't know how to send me a new Sim card that's why he had to reorder it. So the people helping have no odea what you or they are talking about. Worst service I've ever received in my life!!!"^1^August 27, 2015

Greg, ^45111496^16^7^"I've been a faithful customer of straighttalk for the past seven years.  I've had two lines personally and also purchased lines for my parents.  That's a total of 4 lines for 7 years.  The customer service was absolutely appalling.  Tracfone/straighttalk seem to not care about their longstanding customers.  I finally had enough and decided to switch to AT&T's prepaid service which I should've done sooner.  

My straight talk service utilized the AT&T network so it only made sense for me to switch to AT&T's prepaid option.  My straighttalk plan ended on 8/13 at midnight and that morning I attempted to port my number to AT&T however Straighttalk wouldn't release my number to AT&T.  I was forced to purchase another $45 plan in order to reactivate my number so it could be transferred.  Once transferred, I lost the minutes which was a complete loss.  

The customer service was absolute garbage.  I sent an email to the corporate office of tracfone (since they don't offer a phone number) and didn't receive a response for 2 weeks.  

AT&T offers 2GB less of data however, with auto refill you save $5 per month on your bill. Also, with their mult-line discount, you receive an additional $5 savings on subsequent lines.  All in all, I'm glad I switched because the attention and service I've received from AT&T has superseded the last 7 years wasted with straighttalk.  DO NOT PURCHASE."^1^August 23, 2017

I got the email containing the card  less than an hour after making the purchase and I had no problems adding it to the phone account.

ManoloMom, ^45111496^10^2^"For those of us who are moderate to above moderate usage of both phone and internet this fits the bill. For excessive usage it does slow down a great bit but it is still worth the price. My phone is Verizon based which gets the best service for this area. That responsibility falls on the shoulders of the consumer. Find which Straight Talk phones or transfer phones use which service for provider base and the $45 card applied to the phone that utilizes the best service for your area just can't be beaten."^5^March 14, 2016
deadthelma, ^45111496^9^3^"For some reason, I've always gotten the best service.  I used to live in an extremely rural area where people would have to sit outside to use a cell phone successfully,  but I never had to with straight talk.  Also, I like it better than a plan because it's just easier, and I've been with straight talk for 7 years now.  That's not to say I haven't experienced a couple of hassles with customer service now and then, but I think they've made a lot of improvements, and I think a lot of it has to do with miscommunication. 

HERE'S HOW TO KEEP YOUR PHONE NUMBER

 A lot of people gripe about losing their phone number when they reactivate their phone, but the trick is, if your service has been disconnected because you didn't add air time right away, all you do is select the add airtime option and your service comes back on with the same number.  If you decide to reactivate, it activates it with a new number.  I've gone as long as a week with no service and still had the same phone number because I simply added the airtime as if my service hadn't run out.  In fact, most of the time I forget and end up going about a day before realizing my phone is out of airtime.  I've had the same number for 5 years now (would be longer, but I chose to change it)."^5^April 25, 2017
walmarxxxx, ^45111496^9^1^"It's pay as you go cell service. Nothing too exciting, but it is cheaper than a contract and just as good. The only issue I have is that when you load the new card it just automatically add the the to the end. Instead you lose the remaining time."^4^March 16, 2016

quan, ^45111496^6^1^"I've been using straight talk for years. Last month I made the mistake of trying verizon's fake unlimited plan, which I'm still dealing with, since they decided to open a second account in my name and not tell me it was active until they sent me bills for $291 dollars and threatening to report me to the credit bureaus. 

Regardless if you have a hard time with the major carriers or not, these headaches just don't exist with prepaid plans like straight talk. If you can't pay, or you forgot to update your new debit card info or something, you just don't have a working phone for a few days, then you go pay it. 

No late fees, no collections, no worrying about your credit.

They work with sprint, verizon, t-mobile, and at&t. You can use unlocked carrier branded phones from all carriers. Not that every possible phone would work, but you have many more options than you would with anyone else.

I started with the straight talk S3, then used a verizon LG G3, now I'm using my Nexus 6p with their verizon sim.

If you want more data for the next month, in the app just select 10gb $55. Then the next month go back to 5gb for $45.

I've never really had any problems that weren't easily fixed with a fairly quick phone call."^5^May 17, 2017

Scott, ^45111496^4^0^"I purchased the Straight Talk service from Walmart, 2 months ago. I had the worst customer service experience of my life. I brought over my out-of-contract Samsung Galaxy S4 and ported over the phone number I've been using for 10 years. I had problems with Straight Talk's online activation and had to call technical support to set up. After being transferred up the chain of support, I was finally put in contact with someone that could activate the phone. (every person you speak to at Straight talk asks for all you info every time, contact info, sim card number, etc, so it's excruciatingly slow), Phone worked for one month.

On the day the service auto-renewed, my phone and data service stopped. Called support again and after being transferred up the support chain, it was determined that the sim card number they had in their system was incorrect. They put in the correct SIM number and got the phone working.

One month later, when the service renewed, the phone again stopped working. Again, I got transferred through support people. Again, it was determined that the SIM number in their system was wrong, I asked that they try to reset it like the previous time but was told they could not do that but would send me a new SIM card.

The next week, new SIM card arrived -- it was the wrong size. Again called and explained the whole story. Straight Talk said they would sent me another SIM card. The support tech said he had to deactivate the previous sim card. After 2 hours on the phone, he came back on and told me that my phone number was lost and I would need another phone number! I was told there was nothing they could do but I could call the original provider and ask if I could get the number “portable” again. They did not know what phone company now controlled the number or who I should call. It was bad enough that they lost ownership of my number after I had warned them not to, and they assured me they wouldn't, but they also refused to acknowledge their mistake or offer any remedy.

I asked to speak to a manager but the support tech refused and told me there was no one that could help me. I asked for a manager's name and contact info and was told they could not give that to me. I asked to be transferred to a manager and was told they are not allowed to transfer calls -- that the manager would have to come over and use their headset. I said that would do and was told that the manager was in a meeting and that it could be 20 minutes or longer. I asked if there was another manager and was told all the managers were in a meeting. I asked if they could take my contact information and have them get back to me, and was told they could not do that. So i waited a half hour for the “Senior Manager” to come over (and use service tech's headset!). I explained the situation-- and there was no remedy, no acknowledgement, no solution, nothing. He would not give me his name or contact info. The senior manager confirmed that “as per corporate” they have no way to email or call outside the company. Useless. Time to get another phone service and a new phone number."^1^February 2, 2016

Nancysclocks, ^45111496^1^1^"We have been on straight talk for years. Even talked several of our friends and relatives to switch to straight talk. Never had any problems with the service but the customer service is awful. I got a new straight talk iPhone 6 about 6 months ago and gave my old straight talk 5s to my sister in law at that time and helped set up her service. I ordered a new SIM card for it. When we got it in the mail we called and told them she wanted her old number transferred and they ended up giving her a new number by mistake. Even though it was their mistake they said that we would have to get a new SIM card and they would have to send it because wasn't available in the store.  Took about 5 days to straighten it out with the new sim. A few weeks ago my brother in law gave me his old iPhone 7 and I got on line to transfer my number to it. Tried to call my sister in law in the mean time and got a recording of no service. I finally figured out they transferred my sister in laws number to my new phone.  Her phone quit working and she is home bound and and was getting home health. I thought it would be an easy fix, but no. They said since her phone was a straight talk phone I had to get a new SIM card for her and they would have to send it and it ended up taking about 6 days to get it. I had to drive 30 miles to take her my phone so she would have one. Then I had to go back when I got the SIM card to fix her phone. That finally taken care of I transferred my number to the new phone by calling them. They ended up stopping my auto refill for no reason. I have been on the phone with them a lot lately. They are all overseas and most of them you have trouble understanding and they have trouble understanding you.  I tried to call their corporate headquarters to let them know about my problems so they could improve their service to no avail. I was routed all over the world about 10 times to overseas countries, everywhere except their headquarters in supposedly, Florida. I finally gave up. I really don't think it exists."^1^December 20, 2017

I have been ordering the (Email Delivery) Straight Talk Card online for over 5 years now. Unfortunately, over the past 3 months it's been taking up to 48 hours to receive the email & pin.  At first, I figured it was maybe a delay that was temporary due to maintenance.  Now it's becoming an inconvenience. The email & pin use to be delivered within an hour. Now there's a disclosure stating it can take up to 48 hours.  Sorry to say, it's not worth the wait anymore.

ShanaD, ^45111496^1^1^"I was happy with Straight Talk service to begin with. However, out of no where, my SIM card deprogrammed and stopped working. I contacted Straight Talk customer service. They said they'd ship me a new SIM card. No big deal, a couple days inconvenience. Well, first they sent me the wrong shipping info. Then, I contacted them again and they gave me the right info and assured me the card would be delivered the next day. That was a week ago. Every time I track it changes the message saying it left the same facility in Florida, different times every day. Every time I contact the customer service they try to tell me it will arrive the following day.
Now I'm at day 10, different info every day. The customer service says nothing but 'Sorry for the inconvenience'. Again, if it were just me I'd think it was a fluke. But after going on different online forums and social media apparently this is a very common problem with Straight Talk. First, your card goes bad for no reason, then they jerk you around for a few weeks saying they're having shipping problems with the new card. At least a half dozen other people on their facebook page are having the exact same problem right now. 
Wal-mart - I would suggest you push Straight Talk to get their card and shipping issues resolved or sever your ties with this company."^1^December 12, 2017

SassyTruthReviewer, ^50213225^132^31^"I have purchased the email phone card for 5 months now and have waited to post my review. 

First, it does what it says. You purchase and in my experience within 10 minutes, I have my pin sent to my email.  

Except

One time, my service ended on a Friday and I get paid on Friday. I didn't remember to order my card until well after 6pm. Let me tell you that it took a day for me to receive my pin. I went so far as to try to cancel it, but it wouldn't cancel. 

The other 4 times, I order my card (email pin) on business days and sometimes at 8pm or later, and during the after business hour times, it may have taken nearly 4 hours, but if ordered by at least 6pm EST, I got it within 10 minutes of receiving my order confirmation email. 

All in all, great and convenient to do. I have encountered the issue of going into the store (Walmart) and there were no phone cards at all. And, there is the issue of transportation and gasoline. This saves me the trip and that's the SassyTruth!"^4^September 25, 2016

I have always tried to figure out this data graph and mess with it hoping that my internet gets faster somehow so I took a picture of my data graph and as you can see it isn't showing data usage since the 10th so idk if that means my data this month is really unlimited or what.

I call the customer service number and they told me the reason my speeds are slow is I'm over 2 GB.  I almost blew a gasket.  So I asked for a manager to clarify this $55 plan.  She said there's restrictions and she would lift them to go back to high speeds.  Why do I have restrictions?

Just purchased the phone on the 25th and am very just disgusted. Today I spoke with a very rude agent who insisted I speak with technical support despite me telling me I have done so eight times already and the issue was not resolved. Once I finally reached a respectful human being who cares about his job in the refund department I was told that even though this is a straight talk phone and product I am unable to receive a refund because I purchased one of their airtime cards that they allow to be sold at Walmart.

Mine, ^50213225^46^16^"Straight talk.  Should be giving 10 gig's.   For 45.    Not 55.  

I've had straight talk since they opened.    

And I started with 2 gig's.   And a few years later they gave me 3 gig's.     For 45.     

The companies out there now are giving unlimited gig's.   

So I'm thinking about moving my service.    

So to all of us who have had this service since day one.   


We deserve to get unlimited option like they did in the beginning and then we found out that we only got so much. And then they shut us down to a crawl.     

Well hopefully they will catch up to all the others"^1^April 17, 2017

KSKL, ^50213225^39^16^"I have two phone numbers with Straight Talk - one working, the other not. I have spent hours and hours and hours on the phone with their reps ('just a moment while I check my system') while they check service in my area (good coverage), check eligibility of the THREE unlocked phones I have tried their SIMs in (two of which we've both confirmed are eligible). I have driven 5 miles to sit under a cell tower, on their instruction. I have waited 24-48 hours for activation, on their instruction. They have sent me a replacement Bring Your Own SIM and I now have FOUR SIM cards that do not work. I have taken my phone to Apple where the Genius Bar determined there is nothing wrong with it. Yesterday I called in the morning to try one last time and at the end of the call the rep told me if this didn't work I could get credit on my working SIM in a separate phone for the non-working one. After a day of trying to get the non-working SIM to work I called back last night and spoke to a supposed supervisor named 'Andrea' (although I doubt she was a supervisor, or else everyone who answers the phone is a supervisor. She refused to transfer me to anyone else) and she both could not help me AND basically called the other rep a liar as she could not or would not give me some credit in my working account. I have $65 of non-working SIM cards and even a little bit of effort or a gesture of goodwill such as half that amount in credit on my working phone would have made me go away. And I told her that.

I'm trying to minimize certain things I used to do a lot on my phone, like watching shows on hulu & videos on YouTube.  I play a lot of games and that doesn't seem to take up too much data.
I love the straight talk app, so I can monitor my data usage.  the service for phone calls & texts is also excellent.

The problem I ran into was the data that is suppose to be (unlimited high speed). The initial issue with one of my lines was my fault, we did not know tethering or sharing data with other devices was not acceptable per there conditions. The second issue though I believe more took place because they assumed we were also tethering one of our other phones as well but is not the case. It is just used frequently for movie watching through amazon which made our data usage be high. Unsure if this is a common practice but as of right now. Only one of our lines is still working high speed and that's because the data usage isn't high."^1^March 9, 2018

jms6612, ^947596782^14^1^"I switched over from an Alcatel A564C Android phone to this iPhone 6s plus because some of my apps wouldn't run anymore on the Android due to a non-upgradeable OS.  It is very frustrating to have apps stop running due to forced OS upgrades that are not possible on a phone.  I'm very glad that I upgraded to this iPhone because it is better in almost every way, and there is no Tracfone prohibition against future OS upgrades since they are done from Apple.  I've already upgraded the iOS to the latest version 12.2, and all apps run quickly and smoothly.  Even the built-in 12 MP camera blows the Android's camera away in terms of image quality and resolution, and the plus model includes an optical image stabilizer.  There is no going back to Android for me."^5^May 14, 2019

At first, the phone can't accept calls, it goes straight to its voicemail. I worked with Apple tech support as well as TracFone tech support. Apple tech asked me to remove the phone's SIM card, wait for 10 seconds and insert it back in. However, my iPhone still could not receive calls and have gone directly to voicemail. TracFone tech asked me to turn off the phone, wait for few seconds and turn it back on.  The phone immediately began to receive calls, they no longer put calls in voicemail! It works perfectly."^5^October 16, 2019
Evan, ^947596782^3^0^"I bought the iPhone 6S from Tracfone in June 2019. It came with iOS12.4. My only regret it it only has 32GB of memory, which is only a fraction of my entire music collection on iTunes, so I have to select which playlists to put on it from my MacBook. I also us it in CarPlay mode in my 2016 Honda Civic - if you drive and use it a lot of your data (same for roaming - turn it off it not needed) that you may have to top up rather quickly. Also note that the phone is locked (by Tracfone) in the first year of ownership. After 1 year, you can call their tech support to unlock it. If you travel overseas, you can't put a new SIM card ino the phone and use it unless yu can unlock it."^4^August 22, 2019

I also think the camera works really well! in my opinion, it's a great phone for the price! I've also dropped it a few times (just recently from the top of some bleachers) and with a basic screen protector, from tj maxx, and a Kate Spade phone case there is not a scratch or crack anywhere!!"^5^November 6, 2019
jmiller, ^947596782^1^0^"So I've been an android fan/user for the past 3 years but I recently purchased a macbook and ipad and liked them so much I decided to give the iphone a try, but didn't want to splurge on one of the later models until I was sure I was comfortable using ios. Well I've had the phone for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say I probably will never go back to android. 

The phone is in fact BRAND NEW, comes sealed with instruction booklet, headphones and charger, as well as a sim card (the sim card slot opener is underneath the phone holder in the box in an envelope, use that and not a paperclip).  If you already have an apple id account setting up is a breeze. I was able to transfer over most of my apps from my android using the Move to IOS app on my Samsung phone. If you have straight talk your service will now be under tracfone but you still pay through straight talk and buy straight talk monthly plans. 

The 32 GB of space is more than enough, I didn't transfer the 2,000 photos I had on my camera roll from my old phone, instead I uploaded them to google photos on my old phone, then downloaded the google photos app on my iphone and chose which photos I wanted to transfer to my phone. I was initially worried about not having expandable memory like I did on my other androids, but after installing all of my apps and downloading my itunes library, I still have about 14GB of storage left 

The camera is probably one of my favorite features. Coming from an 8MP phone and going to a 12MP phone, was a huge deal to me. I take lots of photos for work so having a good camera is a must. I like the live photo feature that allows me to take photos and takes like a 3 second video with each one. The screen is very nice and vibrant I also love the touch ID feature, I no longer have to use my password on certain secure apps on my phone. I also like the fact this phone comes with a headphone jack, unlike the 7, 8 or X  series. Syncing my iphone to my macbook and ipad is another great feature. With icloud, I can take a picture with my phone and have them automatically show up on my macbook and ipad. I also enabled the sync over wifi that way I can sync my itunes library to my iphone without using an USB cord

Overall, for the price this phone is a steal. I know it's almost 5 years old but I think if you'd like to try out an Iphone without breaking the bank this phone is perfect. 

*I suggest getting the square trade 2 year warranty. For $50 you get a piece of mind that if you drop your phone, spill a drink or have mechanical failure, you don't have to pay out of pocket. There is a $29 deductible but I find that very reasonable considering the cost to fix any issue with your phone will cost AT LEAST $50."^5^March 19, 2019

The camera isnt as great as they say. WORST OF ALL you cant take a selfie or even hold your phone while doing something. The edge is far to sensative making the phone think youre zooming all the time. I give at 3 stars because it charges fast ( but the battery doesnt last long) Its speed is standered and graphics are good for a 'cheap' phone."^3^November 30, 2019

I wish there was a fix i lose on my timed games The screen is good size and love all the Samsung benefits that it has.

I was pretty happy with the 13 megapixel front and rear facing camera. My only complaint is when sending videos through text. Every time I try to send my friend videos, they look really blurry. I heard that it just depends on your service provider so I guess that's just an issue that straight talk has to work out. Everything else seems to work just fine."^4^October 13, 2018

jms6612, ^891730984^14^1^"I switched over from an Alcatel A564C Android phone to this iPhone 6s plus because some of my apps wouldn't run anymore on the Android due to a non-upgradeable OS.  It is very frustrating to have apps stop running due to forced OS upgrades that are not possible on a phone.  I'm very glad that I upgraded to this iPhone because it is better in almost every way, and there is no Tracfone prohibition against future OS upgrades since they are done from Apple.  I've already upgraded the iOS to the latest version 12.2, and all apps run quickly and smoothly.  Even the built-in 12 MP camera blows the Android's camera away in terms of image quality and resolution, and the plus model includes an optical image stabilizer.  There is no going back to Android for me."^5^May 14, 2019

^891730984^3^0^"I've purchased an iPhone 6 S Plus, when received it I began to setup what needed for the phone to begin using it. At first, the phone can't accept calls, it goes straight to its voicemail. I worked with Apple tech support as well as TracFone tech support. Apple tech asked me to remove the phone's SIM card, wait for 10 seconds and insert it back in. However, my iPhone still could not receive calls and have gone directly to voicemail. TracFone tech asked me to turn off the phone, wait for few seconds and turn it back on.  The phone immediately began to receive calls, they no longer put calls in voicemail! It works perfectly."^5^October 16, 2019
Evan, ^891730984^3^0^"I bought the iPhone 6S from Tracfone in June 2019. It came with iOS12.4. My only regret it it only has 32GB of memory, which is only a fraction of my entire music collection on iTunes, so I have to select which playlists to put on it from my MacBook. I also us it in CarPlay mode in my 2016 Honda Civic - if you drive and use it a lot of your data (same for roaming - turn it off it not needed) that you may have to top up rather quickly. Also note that the phone is locked (by Tracfone) in the first year of ownership. After 1 year, you can call their tech support to unlock it. If you travel overseas, you can't put a new SIM card ino the phone and use it unless yu can unlock it."^4^August 22, 2019

TomWinSouthCarolina, ^45111506^62^7^"I have used StraightTalk for over three years, and used to be extremely happy with the service and coverage.  In the past, I recommended StraighTalk to my friends and business associates.  However, during the last two weeks, I began having problems with the voice coverage.  I have called StraightTalk more than six (6) times in the past two weeks, in an attempt to resolve this problem.  It is not resolved, and I can no longer make or receive voice phone calls.  I can text and receive data.  I have been using Skype to make necessary phone calls.  

In all fairness, each customer service representative has attempted to be helpful, until today.  I spoke with a supervisor, and in frustration, spoke with his supervisor.  The rudest person I have talked to at StraightTalk, was the supervisor's supervisor - who, after being extremely rude, just hung up on me.   

I currently pay for StraighTalk service with three phones - mine, my associate, and for an elderly parent.  I will be changing all of these.  

What good is a phone service on which you can not make or receive phone calls? 

StraightTalk used to be great;  now, it can only be termed a DISASTER!"^1^September 10, 2016

When this happens I just go to the Straight Talk site and purchase the same service for just a few dollars more. Even at Walmart site when I am able to purchase airtime cards online there is normally no more than a 2 hour lag before I get my PIN code via email.

gramma2rd, ^45111506^28^7^"Easy, way to get minutes for my grandsons phone. After you get the email, which in most cases arrives within a half hour of the time of purchase, all you have to do is follow the instructions to add the time to the phone. There are 3 options,  you can do it online from a computer, by making a phone call to an automated system from a landline or you can do it via internet from the phone itself. I`ve tried all three and the only one I had a problem with was using his phone. It said the time was placed in reserve but when the current plan ran out the phone was turned off. Luckily I had saved the email & went to the website, and added the new plan again which turned the phone back on almost instantly.

The paint came off on the sides of the phone. We took the phone to walmart for return and they would not take it back. I have to call Walmart multiple times to get a return label because the seller would not respond (Walmart claimed they called and emailed the seller). On top of that it would take 2-3 weeks to get money back. My relative felt bad for me and decided to keep the phone but this is a horrible experience with both Walmart and this seller"^1^June 8, 2019

caliReviewer, ^45111503^21^4^"I've been using straight talk $45/month plan for about 2 years now and it's the best phone plan I've ever had.  I have used it with iphones and Android.  It uses the at&t network, so coverage is great and data speeds are great.  I travel a lot for work and service is great throughout the country.  It takes a few minutes to get it set up on your phone, but after that you don't need to adjust anything.  Just make sure you track your data consumption and don't go over 5 gigs in your 30 day billing period or you will get throttled to a very slow data speeds.  There are a few downsides.  You can't use straight talk in other countries, even Canada or Mexico.  Customer service is horrible if you ever need it.  A Google search works better than calling straight talk.  It does take a few minutes to set up the data settings on your phone.  I've had problems not getting picture text messages, but not anymore.  Maybe they fixed it.  Overall it's a great service and you will save a lot over Verizon and AT&T."^5^November 20, 2016
Thomas, ^45111503^19^3^"I added a 365 service card, while I still had a month, it merely got rid of my time , then added the 365 form that moment, so I lost a month, and Customer service was not will to fix the issue, so they just lost two customers, since I have two phones that I pay once a year for two 365 cards, I will be using Net10 or something like that in the future."^1^April 13, 2016

John, ^45111503^12^1^"Straight Talk's e-mail delivery plan is a great way to save money and a good alternative to 'auto re-fill'. You can pay with PayPal, which I think is an added bonus. If you're one to stay on top of things and not prone to letting things expire, I'd highly recommend it. I'm already on my 4th or 5th refill with no issues with e-mail delivery or with Straight Talk's 'bring your own phone' service."^5^May 2, 2016
Materminds, ^45111503^11^3^"I know people get nervous about using Straight Talk. Nothing to worry, it's an amazing alternative to the big carriers. No hidden fees and the service is the same. 1st time getting the 6-month plan, it just seems to make sense to save even more!"^5^December 20, 2015

sunny, ^45111503^8^2^"If you purchase your airtime directly from straighttalk they will apply it when your service expires, but if you add a card purchased through walmart you will lose your remaining days, unless you add it on the last day of your service. I received it in 24 hours in my email and had no problems using it. I recommend going through straighttalk directly,let them add on your new time after your old time runs out, to not lose any days of service you already paid for. No problems otherwise."^4^September 10, 2016

None of the reviews, specs, or user manuals mention this, but it has a red LED notification light on the front!! I love this because my last LG phone did not have a notification light, which means I had to wake the phone up each time to see if I had a missed notification.

This phone looks and feels and works like it's brand new. I love it. Super fast, great display and easy to use. Two things I have to mention also. 1) It doesn't allow for video calling. Straight talk, doesn't offer that. You have to use an app like Skype or Snapchat. 2) WIFI calling isn't avail. with straight talk on this phone.

slats46, ^193971639^18^2^"I like this phone, but the texting is a mess.  Only see 4 or 5 lines at a time as you type..  Can't see your entire message on one screen until after you send it.  User had better be sure to review message before sending because speak to text really messes the message up at times, occasionally changing a common decent message into an embarrassing one.  At times it will type the message exactly as you speak it, then change it to wording that doesn't even make sense. So be sure to go back and review before sending because it might have gotten changed after you have moved on in the message. And it only audible alerts once so if you miss the audible you don't know if you have a new message without looking at the on screen message icon.  I'm sure my old TracFone continuing alerting until message was opened.   Don't like the messaging at all but am very satisfied with the other features."^4^March 28, 2019

I have an existing phone (from Tracfone, which is the EXACT SAME COMPANY as Straight Talk) that I wanted to activate with Straight Talk service. That's why I bought this item. I then tried to use the BYOP section of the StraightTalk website to activate the phone. No deal, wouldn't allow me to do so. It recognized the phone when I entered the phone's MEID/IMEI number, but refused to allow me to activate it on Straight Talk. The message I received was something like 'Congratulations! You're already receiving great ...' whatever on Tracfone. Trust me, Tracfone is NOT a bargain when they make you pay per minute. Anyway, I contacted StraightTalk and went through their entire phone tree only to be told that, while they do have a BYOP program, any phones from Net 10 and Tracfone are specifically EXCLUDED from their program. No explanation why -- and there shouldn't be a valid reason why, since they are the SAME company. So, here I sit with this $30 piece of cardboard that I cannot use."^1^September 2, 2014

SO I bought a $30 plan - found that I am NOT allowed to change the plan. ST added the $30 plan and I lost a week of service.

To explain - $45.00 bought 30 days of full service. Tried to change the plan - they added the card and I got only 21 days of full service. I was told that I would have to purchase a totally new ST service and change the number in order to have a $30.. plan.

Voice mail recordings are always static and are not always clear.

Customer service is poor. I have called in a few times for help. When the rep is done with the task they have just hung up. This caused me to have to call back, hold through the queue and then ask for help again for the other questions I needed hello with.

LearnedMyLesson, ^36156160^37^7^"Straight Talk phone cards make a great gift.  Just be sure you're purchasing the correct one when BUYING ONLINE. I bought two of these cards as a gift for my nephew who lives out of state.  I felt purchasing online saved me time - no running to the store or the post office to mail out the cards, and I didn't have to worry about them getting lost in the mail. They were sent in the form of an email containing the Pin number.  Like a good many reviewers for this $30 card, I discovered he couldn't use them with his Straight Talk phone.  It's not Walmart's fault I didn't pay closer attention by reading EVERYTHING in the description, nor is it Straight Talks. So, I spent $60 plus fees on these two cards, then turned around and spent an additional $45+ so my nephew would be able to use his phone. No use making him suffer for my ignorance.  But, SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE HERE WALMART, STRAIGHT TALK AND POTENTIAL PURCHASERS! There are over 100 reviewers here on Walmart.com who did the same thing I did. That's over $3,000 spent on something that can't be used.  $3,000!! and that's only counting the customers who've left a review.   Ok, to be fair, Straight Talk does offer 20 days service in place of the 30 paid for.  One card only. I don't know about most of you folks out there, but I can't afford to throw away $30.  If I had purchased the  cards in-store and sent them snail mail, at least he could have returned them to Walmart and gotten the $45 card. I've learned a valuable (if not painful to my pocketbook) lesson.   Make sure you buy the service plan that works with your phone."^1^February 23, 2017

I've NEVER run out of mins or text avail. The real change & DECREASE IN VALUE OF THE SERVICE PLAN IS IN THE SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF DATA. It was 3GB but is now reduced to 100 MB (1GB = 1,024 MB so 3 GB was 3,072 MB#. So basicly, like a regular contracted plan #ie with Verizon, Sprint, etc.) the change is consistent with low mo. $ for unlimited mins & text ONLY but much higher mo. cost to include ANY DATA.

^36156160^25^9^"When I started using Straight Talk for my phone service it was an excellent deal. But, today I would say it is average, mostly because many of the major providers offer the same service for the same price or in some cases less. The second thing I based this review on is service, can I make a call & can I receive my calls, and customer service. Making calls along the I-5 corridor is excellent but the further you move from the corridor the worse it gets, it is the same with receiving calls. Customer service is poor in my opinion, I had to by 2 sims because Straight Talk sent me the wrong one and even though the customer service agent said I would not have to pay for the correct sim and would receive a free month of service I ended up paying for the new sim card and never received any airtime to make up for what I lost while I was waiting for the correct sim to arrive.

Greg, ^36156160^9^5^"I've been a faithful customer of straighttalk for the past seven years.  I've had two lines personally and also purchased lines for my parents.  That's a total of 4 lines for 7 years.  The customer service was absolutely appalling.  Tracfone/straighttalk seem to not care about their longstanding customers.  I finally had enough and decided to switch to AT&T's prepaid service which I should've done sooner.  

My straight talk service utilized the AT&T network so it only made sense for me to switch to AT&T's prepaid option.  My straighttalk plan ended on 8/13 at midnight and that morning I attempted to port my number to AT&T however Straighttalk wouldn't release my number to AT&T.  I was forced to purchase another $45 plan in order to reactivate my number so it could be transferred.  Once transferred, I lost the minutes which was a complete loss.  

The customer service was absolute garbage.  I sent an email to the corporate office of tracfone (since they don't offer a phone number) and didn't receive a response for 2 weeks.  

AT&T offers 2GB less of data however, with auto refill you save $5 per month on your bill. Also, with their mult-line discount, you receive an additional $5 savings on subsequent lines.  All in all, I'm glad I switched because the attention and service I've received from AT&T has superseded the last 7 years wasted with straighttalk.  DO NOT PURCHASE."^1^August 23, 2017

smj999smj, ^36156160^6^0^"I don't have a smart phone and all I use is texting and some talking. I had Verizon Wireless for a decade, but it didn't make sense to pay $50/month when I could pay $30/month with Straight Talk's 'All You Need' plan, which also uses Verizon's network in my area. I wanted to transfer my Verizon phone and #, which according to the Straight Talk site I could, but they will not let you do this unless you use their $45 unlimited plan. So, I purchased a $72 bundle from Straight Talk that included a $40 Samsung flip phone and a $30 'All You Need' plan. I tried to make the switch and activate the phone online, but at the end of the process, all I could get was a 'portal is unavailable' message. So, I called Straight Talk's customer service and it their agent's computer kept locking up. After a lot of time on the phone, she said it was straight and I should have service in 24 hours, which I didn't. Called back two days later and got someone else to help with my problem. Since I used my service card's pin when trying to activate online, it showed up as being used, which I had to explain several times to someone who didn't speak English very well. Eventually, he got it straightened out and the phone activated the next day. I was then able to port-in my Verizon phone number. However, when I looked at my online bank account, I noticed Straight Talk had charged me for another $30 plan. So, I called customer service back and explained everything to which they directed me to the refund department. After three times of them transfering me to the refund department and cutting me off and having to call them back, I finally got through and was able to get them to add the second plan's time to my length of service. The Samsung phone I got is pretty cheaply made and has no provision for a memory card and doesn't sound as well as the Motorola Barrage I had with Verizon, but it does work well otherwise and it's nice to be saving $20/month. So, bottom line is their prices are good as well as the coverage, but their customer service is pretty poor."^4^September 21, 2014

TereB, ^36156160^4^3^"My husband and i have been using the Straight Talk prepaid phone cards Since March 2010 when we discontinued our land line service. At first my husband was using the $30 card with the 1000 minutes and, since my phone is our main phone, i was purchasing the $45 card. We had no problems with the service and we were saving money by not having a phone contract. Recently, however, Straight Talk increased the minutes on the $30 card to 1500 with unlimited texts, so five months ago, i thought i'd try the $30 card. i do have to keep track of how much time i spend on a call, when before i didn't have to worry about that. Also the call timer on my phone does not agree with the way Straight Talk keeps track of time, so i have to watch that also. i think ST starts the count from the time you push send. it also includes the time when the phone rings whether you pick up or not. i'm texting more now instead of calling. But the good news is that with my husband's phone supplied by his employer now, our monthly phone bill is only $32.40 a month with tax and a small fee!"^4^December 7, 2014

I do hit the restart button which is good for the phone every now & than.  I got a great deal, I have a Unicorn Beetle cover case cause I know I will drop my phone, and this case will protect it, I have drop it more than several times & no issues. The camera takes good pics.I never had an issue regarding hearing the other caller or not being able to make a call, the coverage is available. So far so good, I don't like junk in my life especially gadgets, they either work or it gets replaced, and I won't use junk again.  The only thing I wish was an option for Unlimited features added to your phone.  Tracfone doesn't have that."^5^June 10, 2018

tomseys, ^718154354^1^0^"I was excited to get this phone since it does seem to be held in high regard but in the end very disappointed. On the plus side, the rear camera is pretty good. It is very good in low light and is pretty sharp. The colors are not the most accurate and it is pretty bright but overall a good camera. The screen is clear and vibrant as well. On the negative side, the battery life is not very good even with setting optimized. The Samsung luna pro by comparison is far far better. Even the iPhones are way better. Also, the fingerprint sensor is not near as accurate imo as the iphone 6s or se. It often fails to open the phone which is annoying."^2^January 31, 2020

FORTTY, ^491224133^645^21^"I just got this phone 2 days ago and I'm in love already! My old tracfone was a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime. This was the easiest transition I have ever experienced in the 10 years I have had tracfones. All I had to do was download the app 'Samsung Smartswitch' on my old phone and follow the instructions...easy peasy! All my photos, text msgs., apps, everything was transferred in less than 10 minutes.

I'm so glad I did! So far, I LOVE this phone! It's very fast. The screen is nice and crisp/clear. I'm still playing around with all the settings, so I haven't figured it all out yet, but it's been very easy to work with. Battery life seems to be pretty good. It was 50% charged out of the packaging and I was messing around with it quite a bit, using the camera, downloading/using apps, etc and I just now had to charge it being it was at 15% battery. Here's to hoping this one lasts longer than my old phone!"^5^October 2, 2018
Riley, ^491224133^184^7^"After having this a couple of months, the phone will stop sending and receiving calls and texts.  When it does this, there is no indication anything is wrong, because everything looks normal, including showing 3 to 5 bars of reception.  You don't know it has quit until you try to send.  Then it gives some error message and won't send.  If you restart the phone, it usually wakes up again, only to quit again in a short while."^1^March 4, 2019

I wanted to transfer my On5 phone number and it only took minutes to complete and I had service in less than 15 minutes. I downloaded the samsung transfer app and in minutes all my files, texts, pictures and phone numbers were transferred to my new phone. The J7 is a great phone for the price."^5^November 30, 2018

It's very thin and with a slimline case is less bulky than I had expected.  Battery life seems great so far.

The (small) playback speaker located on the side sounded quite good. which was different from my previous - owned mobile device.

Jade, ^491224133^76^17^"I have been an iPhone user since my first phone, due to needing to getting something cheaper but a decent price, I went with my first Samsung. It's quite different compared to my iPhone X and there are some things I definitely prefer over the Samsung. I don't like that I have to manually do the majority of the things I used to not have to do on my X. I also think the camera is okay at best, I was actually kind of disappointed in how the camera quality is on the Samsung. The Samsung never was able to sync my iPhone X so I could transfer any of my contacts, photos, etc. from my X. My Samsung kept saying it was in another state even after updating the location. Due to this, I had to send myself my pictures to the Samsung and manually put in all my contacts. I lost a lot of my stuff from my iPhone X due to the Samsung being a pain with it's location and not syncing correctly."^3^December 11, 2018

Seeker, ^491224133^41^0^"I bought this phone last week along with a flip phone. This is my first smartphone and while I do like it and am pleased, to some extent, I must say the battery life is almost laughable. I've had it for 3 days and every morning it needs to be put on the charger. I've done no calls and only sent 10 emails so that's not to good, unless its normal. If that is typical or normal then I might have to rethink using a smartphone. Anyway, I like the phone and the picture quality is very good but that battery drain leaves me a bit put off on future phone purchases, especial when it sat with no use for 6 hours and 15% of the battery disappeared."^3^September 14, 2019

Every time I tried to enter my password I had to click on the character 2, 3, 4 times to get it to show, but then it would show up 2, 3, 4  times. I could not just click on a character one time, because it would not show. Then I go to delete the additional entries. I couldn't get it to remove from clicking on it one time, I had to click on it how ever many times it was entered to remove it and ended up removing everything that was entered.  Wanted to get this at least in operation so I went through the set up. The set up had a good walk through of what to do, but some of the settings I had no clue what their functions were.

Occasionally I have trouble when 'tapping' an app that nothing happens, but generally that's a matter of a good cleaning of the touch screen to get it going again.  I've seen comments about poor battery life, but mine is on the charger at my bedside all night and it usually ends the day with over 80% battery life remaining.

jrsshu, ^491224133^3^0^"It's fast, crisp and performs smoothly but it's biggest fault comes in its ill-advertised internal storage space. Yes, you do get 16GB internal storage however you are only capable of using less than half of that which is a huge disappointment. If you want to double your phone as a multi-media device(pictures, videos, app games, etc..) right out of the box, I do not recommend this phone as you will more than likely need to make an additional purchase of a MicroSD card if you don't already own one. Due to the pre-installed bloatware and the lack of being able to see, or disable, most of it the internal storage will fill up quickly if you keep your apps up to date and want to take advantage of its 13MP camera. While I love its performance, I can't justify the price due to the lack of clarity on usable internal storage and there being better options out there. That aside, call quality and clarity is great and it's been fast and reliable as a basic calling device."^3^July 10, 2019

Google voice to text works great for my occasional texting. I'm not into selfies, I'm a DSLR guy, the camera descent descent pictures, auto-focuses well and includes a flash for dark environments. Automatic color balance works well but you get more control in Pro mode. Android consumes a lion's share of the 16GB memory along with the typical too many included apps explaining my one star ding.

Now its 16 GB storage is almost completely taken over by bloatware, so I don't have much room left for installing or updating anything else.  Not even the SD card I installed has helped considering you can't even transfer the major bloatware into it.  If you intend to just use it as a phone, it should work just fine.

Just did a little problem solving from web advice. I attached screen protector & plain thin gel case. Very satisfied with this phone!"^5^September 12, 2019

shyguy, ^491224133^1^0^"When I needed to update my old Samsung, I searched TracFone for the right one. I settled on the Samsung Galaxy J7 Crown for it's long battery life and the Android 8.0 Oreo operating system.  Phone screen is super clear, excellent resolution. Phone call quality is perfect. no wierd gaps in the voice. Clarity is a clear. For my needs, this phone is perfect."^5^February 11, 2020
Carlotta, ^491224133^1^0^"My phone is no longer charging. From the beginning a message would say I needed to use the cable that came with the phone. I am using that cable. The cable will charge other devices but not this one. It acts as if there is a short in the connection but not in the cable . The cable will charge another Android . The phone remains at 0% charged. If you wiggle the cable, it will show it is charging. I have no idea what to do with the phone. It stopped charging suddenly and I really cannot be without a phone."^1^October 18, 2019
^29749074^128^38^"I have been using this for 5 weeks with my Straight Talk UMX Hot Spot. It seems like a very good deal so far but have a few issues with going this route.
Before I bought the Hotspot and this card I spoke at length with a Straight talk customer service lady who was very nice. The problem was that I asked 3 times if this was Unlimited service for 2 months. Each time she assured me that, yes it is. Well, no it isn't at all and was told by another CS rep recently that there is no such thing as Unlimited!
I don't like having to call the one Straight Talk phone number and wade through 15 minutes of prompts to finally talk to someone about this and my Hotspot. There is no separate phone number for data/hotspot or card refill issues.
The other problem is that there is no warning at all that you are running low on data. You have to keep checking the website and when you run out, of course you can't get online to do that!"^4^October 26, 2014
brfanatmines, ^29749074^104^14^"Not sure why the bad review, obviously this is only the data plan associated with a Straight Talk Mobile Hotspot...it will not just give anybody with any device 3G capabilities. The hotspot is a simple device to setup and as long as you do not need blazing high speeds or use a lot of data, this data card is very easy and simple to load. Create an account at Straight Talk, load the code, and you're good to go."^5^August 21, 2014

CGS51, ^29749074^54^178^"I purchased a Broadband card not being aware that I would need another item to be able to use it. NO WHERE in the product description does it say that you first have to purchase a phone or a hot spot unit in order to use it. (AND THEY ARE NON - REFUNDABLE) So to use the $50.00 card I purchased, I had to purchase a $80.00 Hot Spot unit. I WAS NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO BUYER BEWARE when purchasing STRAIGHT TALK ITEMS they are not clear as to what you need to use the product. I only hope they post this review. After I had both parts it worked fine for the trip we went on."^1^May 16, 2014
SavvyShopper915, ^29749074^53^7^"We use the 5GB for general browsing, which works out good for the 2 month span. You can watch a video here and there, but nothing too sizable."^4^November 21, 2014
TCav, ^29749074^41^7^"It's nice to have internet wherever you go. 5 GB for 2 months is more than adequate for use on the road or in places where there is no wifi.. It does NOT replace your home internet, but it's good for use in the car (the kids need to play mine-craft, you know). can't download a ton of movies, but you can find a business or look up some info, or even update your social status anywhere."^5^August 2, 2015
pdmedina, ^29749074^25^5^"When you buy the 60 day plan for the mobile hotspot, it stops working after 30 days. You have to call to re-activate it. StraightTalk says it is a software problem and they are working on a fix. But this has been going on for 6 months now. It is hard to get someone on the phone to help. When it is working, it is pretty fast. Not Verizon 4G fast, but it is ok."^2^April 9, 2016

When I got home I checked my email and no credit contacted customer service and was told it could be up to 10 days and every other time I have returned something it has showing up in the pending area on my crediti cartd. I was also told by both customer service store and online to call the night customer service. I talked to a nice guy mario b. and i not did understand his message very well so i thought i might be getting a refund on the straight talk unopened $50 card bought on line and all i have got this week is snotty, anger, and customer service in store an who did not kmow what to do. I think i deserve at least get my money back for this as a credit and at least a $50 dollare give card. finally goy my refund today the day after i filed a complaint with my american express card. I will hold off on the paperwork with them until tomorrow if you have done anything from my review"^1^December 11, 2015

The website refused my Walmart credit card numerous times and ultimately locked my credit card requiring numerous back and forths to get it unlocked.

Martini12, ^564300365^87^7^"We bought this phone for an elderly family member.  She seems to be doing well in getting used to this phone.  One problem is the location of the camera button on the side.  She tends to touch the easy to push camera button when handling the phone.  The camera showing up on the screen causes some confusion.  Transferring from her old phone to the MYFLIP was more difficult than normal.  Could not do the transfer online, had to call in and get a tech's help.  Now activated the phone has excellent reception, voice clarity is good.  The remaining minutes and time does not show on the screen.  Other than the couple of issues we are happy with this phone."^4^January 5, 2019

DANNY66, ^564300365^55^9^"I bought this at a popular store and thought I could carry over unused minutes from my previous Tracfone flipfone, but now I find I can't. I went online and added minutes but they don't show up on the screen to tell me when I need to refill. And I thought I could refill with just the phone, but I found I had to wait till I had access to a computer. With the previous phone, it was so much easier to get every thing done."^1^November 26, 2018

Bud1941, ^564300365^39^2^"I've owned this phone for about 6 months and have not experienced any real problems.  Data, Text, Minutes, etc., transferred with no problem.  My only complaint is ring tone is entirely too low (I have excellent hearing).  I keep all tones set to the highest level of 15, yet is entirely too low.  To hear ring tone, I have to keep phone in my shirt pocket and then ring tone is about 1/3 what it should be.  Was also disappointed that you cannot obtain remaining data, minutes, text, expiration date anywhere in phone settings.  Otherwise, no complaints."^3^February 21, 2019
Freelance Writer, ^564300365^35^1^"Within two or three weeks of purchase, the outer (front) screen started going black. Then it developed colored vertical lines on the screen. This didn't affect operation of the inside screen. But it was a warning. The unit also does not warn of a low battery, and twice I've been away from the office and found a dead phone."^1^January 16, 2019
CharlesE, ^564300365^32^0^"My old flip phone received a dunking, as a result quit.   I only need a simple phone, no bells or whistle.   So naturally I went for another flip phone.  This phone has extras I do not use, but the worst thing is the battery will not make it through the day.  Sadly I purchase two, in order to have a back-up.   The battery on the second phone is no better.   I must charge the batteries each morning, or leave them charging overnight.   Neither will make it long enough to consider reliable.   Stay away from this phone.   Looks like they are being discontinued anyhow."^1^April 20, 2019

Tried to edit it, that didn't help. Thought maybe it would take a better pic. outside. Tried that and that didn't work. Thought I would take a selfie and you can't take a selfie with this phone. Who ever heard of such a thing?!!!   3rd,  You have to delete everything one by one.(that sucks)  4th,  The battery needs to be charged everyday.  5th,  The fonts are constantly changing on they're own.

I was really pleased with the basic features that came with this MYFLIP phone for my purposes.  photos, video, picks up free local radio stations in the mountains.  I've  had a Kyocera tracphone for ten years and it's now not working, so replaced with MYFLIP phone. I called tech support to make sure minutes transferred and they were wonderful to help me through the process making it quite easy.  I'm going to love this MYFLIP phone.  Funny note: I was trying to setup MYFLIP phone with my AT&T ”fandangled” Iphone and lost connection in middle of setup, couldn't get it to reconnect, so used my New MYFLIP phone to call Tracphone back, which connected immediately and I was able to finish the process!"^5^March 3, 2019

You can't download ring tones or pictures from the store.  You can't change the tone for messages to a louder one.  All of the message tones are too quiet to hear in a noisier atmosphere.

Speaker is nice and loud. It is pretty durable. One time I dropped it on a big hard rock but it took no damage not even the screen on the front. The texting and emailing isn't to bad same with the web browser. The calling length is pretty good as well. When your on the phone with someone and you're in a loud area make sure to put it on speaker. So yeah is phone is a good alternative to your big bulky smartphone.

Tallships, ^564300365^4^1^"This has to be the worst flip Tracfone phone that I've ever had for many years. Bought this phone because my LG 2G was getting old and had to get a 4G if I wanted a Flip phone, the MYFLIP was the only option in my area. The ring tone is low, difficult to hear the party I'm talking too, navigation of phone is not easy, numerous other problems . Connection to my 2016 car only sometimes works, making it difficult to connect to and stay connected to the cars Bluetooth. Only use a Flip phone for emergency and keep in touch to home when on the road. This phone is not worth the aggravation. If I wanted to stay with Tracfone and a better connection I had to, not very willingly, upgrade to a smartphone. Bought the LG Rebel 4, that I don't really need and ate allot of data. So far the LG works great. As far as inexpensive Smart phones go the Rebel is a good choice. If Tracfone ever decides to make available a good LG Flip phone I'll be getting one in a hurry."^1^July 4, 2019

The exterior display, which shows who is calling, the clock, and icons indicating if you have a text or missed call, has already stopped working.  The telephone's signal is also very weak.  It usually takes several attempts to even get a text message to send. What a crummy product.  When I first got the phone, I was disappointed with its lack of ease-of-use.

I'd see missed calls three hours later because it didn't ring, it would change settings on its own, it was very hard to navigate the menue and find anything, very unintuitive and not user friendly at all. I finally got so mad at its unusability when it would not type anything in a text box that I took out all my aggressions on it and punched it until the screen went blank. Now I have an even more useless phone, but not by much. So done with alcatel. Now to find an old LG flip on ebay. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR SANITY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!"^1^July 27, 2019

I had intended on waiting at least another year then adding her to my plan (not tracfone),  but decided a basic phone with limited minutes & data could be good to teach her responsible use before doing so with a gradual increase in freedom with her phone.

Lily777, ^564300365^3^0^"Forget texting. It's a nightmare.  The sound is not loud enough to hear when you receive a text even if you are right next to it.  The battery starts to decline the minute you turn it on.  From 99% to 96% then jump it to 77% looking at it, in the time it takes to turn it back off.  Finding features is also incredibly difficult.  Browse the Web?  Haven't figured that out yet & have had this horrid thing months now.  Oh, and some one else already mentioned you have to text 'balance' to 611611 to find out when your mins. run out or how many you have.  Yep!  And of course that costs mins. + battery life.  Pix are great but have to plug the fone on charge to send or receive:again it's the battery.  I loathe this tracfone.  I heard they are retiring it.  I hope they have another flip phone to replace it.  If they aren't retiring it, I surely would love to get find a new flip phone with some one else.  I'd loose a lot of mins. because my old flip worked wonderfully, easy to use and I transferred the mins.  after yrs of being happy I am now beyond words to tell you how bad this fone is."^1^July 2, 2019
Brad Feuerhelm, ^564300365^3^0^"I like the phone except for it's terrible battery life.

Ringer volume is very low, even when turned all the way up. Message tones are one quick sound, that if you don,t hear it, you will not know there is a message.

JoshMc2442, ^281803361^3^0^"This phone was my first intro to the Edge feature. The Edge feature has a purpose and I can see the selling point to it, but for me it doesn't really serve a purpose. I can navigate other ways much faster than using the edge feature. It also weakened the durability of the phone. I always boasted on the durability of my Galaxy, but this version I ran through two in a matter of months due to accidental drops on the 'edge'. These drops were with a case on it also so I was a bit disappointed in that. When I got my final phone i was very careful with it and it lasted me roughly a year without any breaks cracks or damage. As with most Samsung devices the hardware is hard to beat. Feels great in the hand, heavy yet very lightweight. Camera is dynamite, video is great. Software at times is lacking and sometimes it will lag and drag. Its a small price to pay for the allowance of being outside the box ad being able to download apps from anywhere from anyone. Unless Samsung does some really messed up stuff (like take away the microSD again....i waited 2yrs cause i refused to buy the s6 without the microSD) I'll always be a Samsung guy......I have the s8 early assessment.....its awesome!!!!"^5^April 20, 2017

GalaxyLover98, ^281803361^3^0^"To start off this phone was purchased as a replacement for the Galaxy NOTE 7 I had.. However since they recalled it is figured I'd get this phone instead because it was the next big thing. I'm surprised that I actually like this phone better than the Galaxy Note 7. I'm not sure it it was because I had the blue note 7 & I got a black 7 edge. But I'm glad that I like it better. The camera is phenomenal! I loveeee that it has a flash in the front facing camera. The phone quality is absolutely excellent. I also love the battery life on this phone. It is practically in my hand almost every second and after I put it down it is no less than 50%. If you are considering to buy this phone stop thinking about it and get it!! It really is the best phone out right now! I can't wait to see what samsung has in store for me on my next upgrade!"^5^November 8, 2016

Lioncubmom, ^281803361^3^0^"I had a Note prior to this S7 and loved it! I no longer required the extra features that the note came with so down sized. It took a little getting good used to regarding the smaller size but I'm loving it so far. The battery lasts a long time (hours of Pokémon playing without a needed charge) and man does it charge fast when it's time. The camera takes amazing pictures and maneuvering around the phone is as easy as it has always been. I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for an upgrade or a change of brand. Regarding the reviews about it flying out of your hands, it is light. I bought a clear rubber case for it (I wanted to see the gold tone of the phone) and it stays securely in my hand, no slipping."^5^August 3, 2016

Stinga, ^281803361^2^0^"The edges on the Galaxy S7 Edge are very clean and the aesthetics are both ergonomic and stylish. The camera is very responsive to many different environments, and is especially impressive at capturing crisp images at night/ in low-light conditions. I would definitely recommend this phone for any photographer from an amateur to a professional outdoor landscape expert. The latest Android software makes the S7 Edge very intuitive and customizable too."^5^September 11, 2016

I have just spilled water on other phones from a glass knocked over at the table & fry the phone.

HadHighHopes, ^281803361^2^1^"Considering that my S7 edge is new and has only been activated for 10 days I also bought a protective case and screen protector but that didn't a difference. Samsung claims the phone is shatter proof and water resistant but my device is useless and damaged after dropping it less than one foot in a puddle of water!! 1 ft! I was misled into thinking this phone was less prone to break down but my audio is completely muffled now and sometimes muted with the exception of the speaker but Voice Commands doesn't even work. Very disappointed! The screen is completely shattered and the protective cases for the S7 Edge don't even work because of the design the screen. Don't purchase "^1^April 14, 2016

MusicLvr, ^281803361^2^0^"I haven't had a new phone since 2010, and was quite excited about getting this phone, I know someone who has an older generation of it and theirs is quite durable, they have had several small dropping accidents and not a scratch on it. Now to clarify I am very careful with electronics but there are those occasional mishaps that just aren't expected (my old phone didn't have one dent and only a small scratch after all those years. My new phone wasn't even 2 weeks old and I was standing on the boardwalk, standing, not walking and I had just taken some pictures, which I will admit this phone does quite nicely, when I was done with the pictures I put my arms down and was watching the waves my hands were sweating because it was hot and the phone slipped out of my hands and straight down to the ground. My new expensive phone now has 2 scratches and 2 matching dents. Anything else that was this much and of this poor durablility would have immediately been returned. But that is the fallback with the cell industry now at days since you're kind of stuck with it. I asked the place where I purchased it and they told me Samsung went more for looks that durability on the s7, which I feel after seeing the commercials for the s7 that made them very misleading as for how well these were built."^1^June 7, 2016

OGCaptivate, ^281803361^2^0^"I have owned a Galaxy phone since the first one that Samsung produced, Captivate. I started smartphones with an 'I' competitor which was very advanced for the time but Samsung soon pushed far ahead of the competition. My last phone was a Galaxy S5 and I was not able to get the S6 due to my new carrier contract and now I have the chance to upgrade to a new phone, S7 Edge, and I have to tell you that the features and user friendliness of this phone are fantastic! I am still finding new cool things this phone can do just by adding new apps and looking thru the settings menu. The edge part of the phone is very helpful to get quick info, jump to a app or open a photo. Plus if yo are a new user to these phones there is the easy use option that allows you to do the basic things and clearly puts them out for you on the screen. Easy Peezy. The slim design and the fact that it is dust and waterproof make this a no-brainer when it comes to choosing a phone. Thumbs up to you Samsung for another fine product!"^5^December 21, 2016

SamsungSquirrel515, ^281803361^2^0^"This phone is flat out the best phone I have ever had or had the pleasure in testing. It does everything and has everything. The camera is spectacular. The camera might not seem like much being a 12mp camera but duel lense and low light focus is out of this world. Easily the best camera on a phone to date. The features and tech specs of this phone is amazing. The big battery lasts for hours on in and I'm just really blown away by this phone to say the least. I would definitely recommend this phone to family and friends. I had the note 2 before this phone so you could say I was living in the stone age so you would see my amazement with this phone lol. I actually have tested other phones like the iPhone 6 and 7 also the note 5 and the new moto and lg g5 along with the LG v20. Aldo just recently tried out the new Google pixel XL and I still have to say that the s7 is superior in every way. The only phone that comes close is the Google Pixels and that's only because of the unlimited storage capacity which is just flat out ridiculously amazing lol. GET THE GALAXY S7!!!

The screen and graphics are so much more crisp and more defined. Note over saturated like some other phones I've seen. The design is great overall. Not too hard to hold one handed or get into and out of my pocket. Doesn't slip all over the place. I do use a case and applied a screen protector. I've never had a phone where the screen was the edge of the phone so I didn't want to take any chances.

^281803361^1^0^"I upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge from a Galaxy S6 Edge+ and am very happy I did. It doesn't get hot at all like the S6 edge+ and the software seems better, more user friendly! The only complaint I have is that the glass is not strong enough. I broke the back glass the first week I had it when I dropped it while sitting in a chair and was devastated because it shattered. It should have a metal back for this reason. Since then I have purchased a case and now you aren't able to tell it's cracked but I know! Also I highly doubt it's water resistant at this point. I'm looking into replacing the back glass but if it's too expensive I'll just leave it like it is. On another note the tempered glass I purchased at the same time I purchased the case didn't hold up to its hammer on the screen advertising because I dropped it again, this time on its face and it shattered it. On the upside I was able to remove the tempered glass without any damage to the screen, so I would recommend getting one of those as fast as possible! The downside of the tempered glass on the edge is that once installed, if you have a case on your phone, the edge tab is pretty well inaccessible until you learn how to apply the right amount of pressure at the right angle to get it to work! Also it's very heavy, even without a case. At night when I'm laying in bed, I often have to lay my arms down and rest them for a few seconds due to the tremendous weight of it! But, if you are reading this I urge you to get one despite the cons I just gave to you. I'm almost positive you'll fall in love with your Galaxy S7 Edge just as I did!"^5^September 9, 2016

I don't like how the gallery is set up now. I really hate the fact that the quick contact bubbles at the top of the messages app are gone. I also don't like that in order to send a group message I have to scroll down all my contacts. It was so much simpler before. Personally I think the new update makes some things more complicated and took away what I loved most about the Samsung phones."^5^March 7, 2017
ChrislynnK, ^281803361^1^0^"I upgraded from the galaxy s4 about 3 weeks ago. Initially loved the new S7 but have recently started having issues with it restarting itself, and not being able to navigate some apps. My husband also upgraded from the S4 to the S7 the same day I did. He is also having problems with his new phone, however his major problem is he cannot get any service unless he is connected to WiFi for some reason. Also both of us, even though all notifications are turned on the phones will not notify us when we get text messages or certain other notifications. I am very frustrated that we are both having problems especially with the cost of the phones. Some positives on the other hand include excellent camera, expandable memory, and sleek design. A little difficult to type on but at least you can make the keyboard bigger. The phone also comes with headphones in a nice little case but the new design of the headphones it awful. They are solid plastic with rubber covers that come in 2 sizes, but it doesn't matter what size you use they are very uncomfortable unless you're ears are just the right size and shape. The headphonesecond that came with our S4s were much more comfortable and had better sound."^3^April 29, 2016

Loved the way it performed, the way it felt in my hand. Felt well made. (Upgraded from a BLU phone product) then that fell and broke recently... worst day of my life! I already had my eye on the 7 edge though. Perfect time to upgrade! I thought to myself. So I bought this sweet sleek Ness and just wow! Even faster, doesn't heat up on vr. Quicker, sleeker, smoother, water resistant. I'm impressed. I just hope it lasted till the next surprise phone that comes out next year from Samsung. Hooked for life.

rsoverman, ^281803361^1^0^"I had a 6S Edge that lasted 18 months before I had trouble hooking up a charger. I liked it a lot and went with the 7S Edge as a replacement. I really like this phone too, including the external card option and the getting wet issue. BUT, I have a problem with Bluetooth. I listen to audiobooks all the time. With Bluetooth, there is a split second hesitation(sounds like a stutter) about every 15 seconds. This is with the LG Tone headset. With the Mpow Jaws headset, the split second hesitation turns into 1 - 2 seconds. With regular headphones, no problem. I don't know if the bluetooth issue is with AT&T or with Samsung, but I'm betting Samsung. I have a holster type case and took it off. The hesitation is still there, but not as pronounced. I would still get the Samsung Edge next time. I hope they fix the bluetooth issue. I'm sure it's not a problem listening to music since music is background noise and audiobook is more foreground."^5^October 2, 2016

SmarTechguy, ^281803361^1^0^"This phone is by far the best phone i have ever owned. I'm big on technology and every year I have to get the newest latest and greatest. Last year I went with note 4 instead of s6 only due to no expandable memory. I love this phone. This is the first edge phone I've owned. The edge takes some getting used to due to the way I hold it in my hand. With a case it actually made a huge difference. Samsung pay is amazing. The integrated contact option to take a picture of a business card works really well and makes it really easy. Everything about this phone is top of the line. I gave it four stars just due to the edge being touchy. I have already recommended this phone to everyone and will be buying my third for my brother. My wife is not a big techy but she as well loves this phone. She's big on taking pictures off the kids and loves the better updated camera. The bio-metric scanner is seamless. On the note 4 it would take 4 tries to unlock themail phone. The s7 first try to the point that I press the home button to check the time and it unlocks and opens the phone. It's amazing!!!!"^5^March 24, 2016
Bamdunn, ^281803361^1^0^"After 2 weeks, I really miss my S6 edge. It was an excellent phone. The gaming performance of this phone is the best (for approximately 1 minute 20 seconds). After 2 minutes the frame rate is half that of my s6 edge. The in-game recording feature does not work well. If the performance of the phone stayed the same and the back camera of the phone was the same as the s6 edge, I would love this phone. The new camera on this phone takes square shaped photos instead of the wide screen ones all the other phones take. The low light photos do not come out that well on this phone."^1^March 27, 2016

I was under the impression that the glass was some kind of Gorilla glass, but this doesn't seem to be the case. Needless to say, I've already had to pay a deductible for the phone to be replaced.

Recently I encountered a problem with my iPhone that prevented me from using the full capabilities of the phone so I made the switch to the Samsung s7 Edge. Mind you I was very hesitant because my last android device (Moto X2) didn't live up to my expectations, however my edge blew me away! I absolutely love the camera, honestly it's the best darn camera I've seen on any smartphone in the game right now. I also love the cool features like edge display, and being able to perform multiple functions at once. Did I mention that the design is absolutely stylish (I have mine in the gold color option), and the screen display and resolution is out of this world. All my hesitation went out the window the first 5 minutes of using the phone. I absolutely love it, and don't think I'll ever go back to iPhone'software.

Would be nice if samsung would ecxhnge me my S7 edge for a regular S7, VERY unsatisfied PLUS i went to go exchange it at AT&T FOR the s7 regular version and they said they can't take it back because of the slight damage to the phone and I'm within the 14 day exchange policy."^1^April 22, 2016

I'm not sure what's causing it but if I had to guess I would probably say the problem is extending from Wifi texting and/or possibly HD Voice and video calls.

Snaveebag, ^281803361^1^0^"This is, hands down, the best android experience to date. Fast, and capable of anything you can throw at it. If the plastic build of the past has kept you away from the Galaxy S line, now is the time to give this a try. The Galaxy S7 Edge fits well in the hand and and is probably the most sleek phone around at this time in my opinion. The glass on the back, though beautiful, is slippery, but the curves give it a great feel in the hand. The notification light that I miss from certain manufacturers is included with this device. Camera is excellent in low light and focus' immediately, don't let the drop in megapixels from the last generation fool you. Photos come out better than previous builds, due to the larger camera sensor allowing more light to pass through, in return, higher quality photos. Battery life with my normal use is about a day, usually ending in the evening around 30-40% in my case. In my opinion you cant go wrong with this device."^5^July 12, 2016

GarlicSquash, ^281803361^1^0^"I recently upgraded from my previous Galaxy S4 and this is a huge step up. The camera takes wonderful pictures, the battery last much longer, even with the always-on display enabled and my heavy use. I actually like that the form factor was reduced slightly, I don't notice it with respect to screen size, but one-handed operation is much easier than with the S4. I love the idea that it's waterproof but I'm still too afraid to test it."^5^September 20, 2016

The camera experience was the best I have seen on a smartphone especially in low light. My favorite experience is the battery life and I can easily last up to two full days and with fast charging and ultra power saving mode, there is no way I could have my phone die on me in the middle of the day.

HylianKnight, ^281803361^1^0^"The phone works great out of the box, and after spending some time digging through the settings, I find it easy to find what I need, and what all the features do. The ability to capture screenshots from webpages, and continue capturing for that uninterrupted effect, is a great plus. Camera quality is fantastic, and a definite step up from my S4 Mini(even though, I'll be honest, the mini as a whole was pretty great too). Chose this over the S7 Edge because I prefer to not have those curved screen edges. Gonna take some getting used to in terms of size, and still slightly miffed that the background wallpaper isn't scrollable anymore(yes, still). Has included face chat feature for those who also have an S7. So if you know a bunch of friends who didnt' jump onboard the iPhone bandwagon, or are looking to switch, but held off due to the facetime, this has got ya covered. Expandable memory up to 200GB, but you'll have to wait to get home to upgrade since it requires a special tool(comes with it) to access the memory slot. Non removable battery is another feature, but not sure if I'm happy about that just yet. Time will tell. Yes, it's also pretty smudgy, but that's what cases are for."^5^March 16, 2016

Now can only 'record' my text messages, which I do not want to do. No longer have a feature for changing the tone on the 'timer' not talking about the alarm. I would rather have my old phone back.

Mitch55, ^281803361^1^0^"The most beautiful phone out there. Fast and responsive.

Certainly not a deal breaker, but I'd like to see that flexibility added in an upgrade, or at the least, added to future gen's of the Galaxy......Mitch"^5^December 9, 2016

The amount I talk it up to my family, friends, or a random person in line at a store who notices the phone or me paying with my it, you'd think I was getting paid to talk it up, I'm not.

randerton, ^281803361^1^0^"I got my new S7 Edge about two weeks ago in early March, 2016. I previously had an S5 so waited for the waterproof version with an SD card and better battery life; hence, my rationale for skipping the S6. So far, I really like the S7 Edge - I added a 64MB SD card which has been great. I have not tried loading applications to the SD card yet but understand that can be done if the app will support it. I really like the waterproof feature without requiring the little flap the S5 had over the micro-USB power connection. I also like the wireless power charging and rapid charging features - both of which were not present on my S5. In addition, I've had very good luck with the camera on the S7 so far. The battery life is much improved over my S5 in that I can get through a day now without requiring charging for the most part. I could not do that with my S5. The Marshmellow OS and core apps have performed perfectly so far - I was having issues on my S5 so I'm also happy with this change."^5^March 22, 2016

Ryan11181, ^281803361^1^0^"The galaxy s7 edge in my opinion and my experience for me didn't quite live up to all the hype. Yes the camera works great and takes great pictures. It's usually pretty fast responding. .from time to time it gets slow and sluggish and doesn't want to respond right away. I've had it restart on me by itself automatically. The biggest issue for me is the battery life. With it on airplane mode and background apps restricted and in power saving mode I get close to maybe 12-13 hours of battery life and that's if i don't use it too much. If I use it i get less than 13 hours. An issue with it being slow is happening as I type. I'm typing and it's taking a few seconds for words to show up and if I need to delete it takes a few seconds for the phone to respond to delete. I've done a hard reset a couple times and done a factory reset twice and no change. It didn't seem to help any in doing so"^3^March 22, 2016

Rmcleskey, ^281803361^1^0^"I really do love this hardware. I feel like I'm from the future when I'm holding it. Unfortunately, I don't feel so futuristic when I'm using it. While many of the software features are great and the os is overall pretty stable, the lack of fluidity can be fairly jarring. Just today I had to restart the phone because it was exhibiting symptoms of a memory leak (extreme lag and then apps like the keyboard closing and restarting while using them). Also, the fluidity of animations leaves a little more polish desired. If Samsung were to just polish up the software a bit more I could comfortably say this is the best phone you can buy."^4^March 25, 2016

I got this phone as soon as it came out and I expected some bugs or things I wouldn't like but I have been I love everything about it. One of my favorite features is the fingerprint scanner. I love the fact that I can handle my phone whether in my pocket or hand and not have to worry about accidentally unlocking it or 'butt dialing' anyone and I don't have to enter a password everytime. It's handy when it comes to my niece getting a hold of it and not worring about her unlocking it AMD messing with it. I also love that the speaker is now on the bottom and not the back.

I had a Galaxy s5 before I got this one and I liked that phone but I love everything you can do on the edge. I was afraid the battery would run dead really fast but it lasts me all day so that is a huge relief.

I do love the ability to add memory, the camera is the best one yet and the battery life is pretty good. Also, love the fast, cordless charging. But all of that is overshadowed by how AWFUL it is to actually use this phone due to the curved edge. It's sensitive to touch along the edge so you can only hold it by the corners. Forget giving it to someone to take your photo - they touch it and they've either accidentally closed the camera app or opened up others, simply because they tried to hold your phone.

I love my Samsung s7 edge and would highly recommend it over an iPhone any day."^5^September 7, 2016

No more plugging in the phone and having the micro port get damaged like on my old phone. The phone looks and feels great.

HD4life, ^281803361^1^0^"This is my third Galaxy phone. So far this has been my favorite. I love the size of the battery, and the water and dust resistance. The dual edge screen is great. I love how you can customize the panels of apps and tasks that you use most often as well as other information you would like to see . The phone is fast due to the 4 GB of RAM, and the ability to expand your memory to 256 MB to handle an enormous amount of downloads is great. I highly recommend this phone."^5^September 16, 2016
RayJJ, ^281803361^1^0^"I recently upgraded from the S6 to the S7, and I have to say I'm not all that impressed. Now don't get me wrong, it is a nice phone overall, but coming from the S6 there really doesnt seem to be any speed or performance increase. The battery as well, for being bigger, lasts about the same as the S6, and that is in power save mode and the always on screen shut off. The 2 added features of being waterproof and having an SD card are of no real value to me. If I were looking for a phone, I'd just get the S6 since it should surely cost less now that the S7 is out."^3^March 21, 2016

SparkSan, ^281803361^1^0^"This is the best cell phone I've ever had. I moved from a Note 4 and the screen is nearly as big, brighter, and the entire phone is much smaller and lighter.

I only wish it was cheaper."^5^September 3, 2016

Had the GS 5 as my last phone and have used the other popular brand, but prefer Samsung. Converted friends over to these products when illustrating major differences and ease of use. Will buy the S-View case for the GS 7, since I found it convenient and useful for my 5. Original cases are too slick to securely hold."^4^December 25, 2016

Blackdevil, ^281803361^1^0^"I got this removed because it had a competors name on the review. Ill try not to invlove the 'competitors' name on it. Well I've had every single phone from the 'competitor' we all know who it is. Ive had the first one including the the original to recent one even the inbetweens. The S7 Edge is my first Android device that I love and find easy to use. I had the 'double tap to unlock phone' but I would barely use it due to me wanting to stick to the 'competitor'. If i had the choice between the 'competitor' or samsung I'd choose samsung anytime. I really wish I would have started with a Galaxy. It been about a month now and I haven't even touched the 'competitors' phone. I'm hoping to get the S8 when it comes out as well. The reasons for this is that that the S7 has better customization which sold me from the start. It's software is a bit more complicated but due to not really knowing the settings and geuestures of the phone. I mean from being so used to the 'competitors' phone since they're barley alike even when making a call or messaging. I also love the curved edge even though from the start I'd hit the sides a lot. Another great thing about it is the water resistant/proof since I go swimming a lot in summer. Side to side the 'competitor' and S7 are comparable being used for their own purpose but the shortcuts and animations on the S7 makes it faster and easier to use even though from the start it didn't feel like it was. I'm glad I did the change and I hope samsung keep on pulling out great devices like the S7 Edge. I can't wait to see what samsung pulls out of their sleeves next."^5^June 15, 2016

I dropped my phone about 3 feet and a long crack appeared on the screen. I was very disappointed because my previous phone, a Samsung Galaxy S5 had survived worse drops than that without getting a single scratch on it. Later that day I check my phone and that single crack had rapidly expanded. A single crack expanded to the point my entire screen looked shattered. Worse phone I have ever had."^1^September 7, 2016

I purchased my Samsung s7 and love it already, I only wish Samsung had a 'Imessage' like feature as it was one of the things I loved most about my IPhone.

Cstina2010, ^281803361^1^0^"I have owned various Samsung phones over the years, this is THE WORST product ever offered. You can not hold the phone without touching all the side nonsense. You are unable to text without one of the side items opening and taking you somewhere else all together. I turned off the side capabilities and the keyboard still isn't right. I'm not sure if it's a different set up than the Note or if it's a sensing issue but it's terrible. Also, the battery does NOT stay charged more than an hour and a half. I am not sure why but I assume it has something to do with all the side things but it ate thru my alloted data unimaginably fast.

Come to find other reviews this is a problem. If you're going to design a phone it should last more than one slip.

Would have liked the camera and touch pad to be made of gorilla glass because the camera cracked and the home button is very scratched. 3.

I also notice issues with my SYNC bluetooth connection and some GPS apps. I have had Samsung phones since S3 and now I will likely be sending the S7 back."^2^December 18, 2016

Headed out Wednesday to a conference, and 'woman oh woman' what a beast this battery is! Lasted through my 5 hr. drive, even using Google Maps for the last hour over mountain roads, and still had enough juice to finish out the afternoon of conference sessions with battery to spare. AND the fast charger is exactly that--blazing fast! Can't wait to try it out on the new Samsung stand fast charger, ordered! The screen is extremely beautiful, and i LOVE the Edge panels. Not much of a gamer, but it is handling whatever I throw at it quickly. Camera auto-focus is certainly amazing! Now can't wait to order my S-view cover!!

Jackalope, ^281803361^1^0^"As a long time iPhone user I was hesitant to switch to the android platform. I am glad that I did the display on the Galaxy s7 Edge is the best I've seen on any handset and I checked out many while shopping for a new phone. The camera is also exceptional and the operating system is really quick. One piece of advice since there aren't many choices out there yet for protective cases is be very careful to not drop the phone because by the edge screen design it can shatter easily so be sure and be careful and buy a good case to protect the phone because both the front and rear are made of gorilla glass. I've never had a screen Crack on any phone that I've owned but managed to shatter the screen on my s7 edge within one month of owning it. Thank God I had taken the insurance on the phone. I am still happy with the s7 edge. Just be careful."^5^September 14, 2016

This thing however, can't be killed in an entire day. I'm super heavy on the usage. Always maxing out on browsing Facebook and messenger. Browsing forums on reddit. And playing some neat little games I found on Google play. Every day I average about 7 to 7.5 hours of Screen on Time and thats just the battery! The rest of the phone is amazing as well. The performance is spot on and the user experience is fluid and easy. Not to mention how the phone physically looks and feels. This thing is beautiful. I have to put mine in a case cause I'm clumsy but this phone is one I have a hard time putting a case on. It's so pretty looking and the silver is just flashy.

The case is very slippery, so I was in the market for a protective covering or something to improve the grip. I wasn't quick enough. It slipped out of my hand while removing it from my pocket this morning and of course the screen cracked. Very disappointed in the durability of this product.

chester40391, ^281803361^1^0^"I previously owned the S3 and then the Note3 before moving to S7 edge. I have no issues with it. It is only a bit smaller than the note3 which was a tad wide to put into some back pockets anyway for transport. The curved screen is very attractive and I found that I appreciate the visual affect it has when scrolling different screens. It feels more natural and realistic to see the the next screen coming around from the side like a physical carousel. The resources given to the UI likely help with this. I have yet to play with the edge menu. Ive popped it out on accident a few times but once I learned its placement it doesn't happen anymore. "^5^June 2, 2016

Of course I cannot complain about the water proofing, the exquisite camera quality for both front and rear cameras.

It gave me a good run for all the abuse it's taken and I'm finally letting it go due to its audio jack busting at last after about a little less than a year of use. Mind you, this thing went it's lifetime with only a tempered glass screen protector (which now has a bunch of tiny hairline cracks streaking across it, yet not the screen underneath), taking drops, spills, getting rolled over, tossed, lost, chipped, and only god knows what other atrocities.

Second, this phone uses the GSM networks, and works in places like Hamburg, IA. Third, if you place the battery in super saving mode, you can use it for at least two to three days.

WiseBuyer, ^885539367^1^0^"This phone is pure junk!! You don't want to buy this phone because it's nothing more than a Samsung spam and spy box filled with Samsung junkware and pop ups. I can guarantee I'll never by another Samsung phone after my experience with this one. The volume suck so bad and any words spoken with an 'S' in it screeches and sound like fingernails down a chalkboard. The volume crackles and is so low that you can't hear the phone ring if you're sitting right beside it. This morning I set 7 alarms all 15 minutes apart and didn't hear one of them. Yes, all the volume setting are set to high and I did hear the alarm on my old phone, even though it is not activated. Instead of adding all these useless programs, maybe they need to improve their speakers a little since this is my 5th Samsung phone, and I will admit they never did have very good quality or loud speaker, but this one is a joke. 
What's really annoying are all the Samsung pop ups and apps that you keep turning off but Samsung keeps turning them back on even after you turned them off several times. I don't want Bixby, I already have a calendar and I don't want to your crappy voicemail service just to name a few. I have no use for your stupid cloud, calculator or any of your other spyware garbage. I use Google backup already and I don't need a second program adding the same programs, and I don't want them running on my phone wasting memory and draining the battery. Also I don't know if the Chinese makers of this phone found a deal on the color gray or what, but all the menus, tool bars and backgrounds are light gray with a little darker gray font that you can barely read anything on the gray background. Also even though there is a slide bar, you only have two options for the off colored yellowish gray brightness, you can either have faded gray or washed out bright but no matter how you set the brightness, it looks like crap."^1^February 19, 2019

misscricket, ^29749071^203^34^"$15 bucks for 1 gig does not seem like a good deal at first. It is basically mostly an activation fee. It keeps the device active and you get 1 gig of data for those who only need the mobile hotspot once in a while. Sure beats what the others charge for a basic low data plan. They charge 50 bucks for 5 gigs whether or not you need 5 gigs a month or not. At least I can keep my service active and if I need more data in a month I simply buy a larger data plan card. It is not for the heavy user. Of course the larger amount of data you buy that month each gig gets cheaper. As you are not paying for the initial activation fee and buying in bulk they can charge less per gig too. For me it is a great deal as in most months I don't even use the whole amount. $15 bucks for backup internet is well worth it. It means if the power and DSL are knocked out and I have important things like business to tend to online I am not out more money by losing a sale or an order I made get screwed up by the outage. If its stormy I just switch off the DSL and hop on the hotspot and stuff gets done"^5^March 20, 2014

So buying 1GB data card is really not what it appears to be. I have tried other service providers and this is not always the case.

Additional:

I brought a 4G LTE hotspot and this 1GB data card. I could not get the 4G LTE hotspot to work with 4G LTE. The hotspot would only work under slower speeds."^1^November 25, 2014

Unhappyshopper, ^29749071^23^6^"I purchased this hot spot device so I could use it when I traveled to Pa last year. The I bought 4GB card to go with it because I work from my computer. The connection was horrible and I could not work. when it worked, it was so slow. I ended up losing 3gb of data because I could no use it..This year when I went, I only bought this 1 GB card...and it did not even work at all. I even called straight talk to make sure the data was on the device and they said yes it was showing and I told them where I was at and they said I should have internet. I did not...the whole thing is probably still on there and again I will lose it because I could not use it there and I am home where I do have internet..So basically, I wasted the cost of the Hot Spot device and now 5 GB of data. And I definately will tell peope not to invest in this product"^1^July 3, 2015

crustychemist, ^29749071^13^4^"I purchased the data to use with the U240C hotspot to get internet while staying in RV campgrounds without wifi.  On the plus side it did provide connection to send and receive email and light web browsing. 
The basic setup process is easy,similar to setting up.  
The speed is mostly slow but varying between apps and websites for unknown reasons.  For example, downloading email with MS Outlook on a laptop is agonizingly slow even for the briefest text.  However, email through the browser interface is reasonably fast.  Smart phones connected by wifi also had speed variations by app.
I could not connect to some internet sites at all with Straight Talk, including my home security cam.  The error message was 'disconnected by software'
I data remaining function is very difficult to access and you apparently use significant amounts of data just checking.  I struggled for more than a week to get it working at all.  I phoned straight Talk support and after waiting on hold for 10 minutes was given   the balance verbally.  The agent said there were many complaints that the usage monitor did not work.   I discovered on my own that it will never work if you are using Chrome browser but would sometimes work in MS iExplorer.
I GB of data lasted 5 days of light use.  I would rate $15 for 1 GB a fair value had there not been the multiple issues"^2^February 11, 2017

I bought this phone for some days, matte black, came in the original box, sealed, and all the accessories, there was not a single sign of use on the back and the screen, I pluged it into my PC and use ibackupbot to check how many times it has been charged, and then, boom, cyclecount shows the number of 5, which means it has only been charged for 5 times, basically a new phone, since the battery will be tested at least 1 when it came out of the factory, so the phone has only been charged 4 times by its original user, the battery capacity was still 1950mah."^5^April 21, 2017

I upgraded from the s9 after having the s7 edge and didn't get much of a difference between the 7 edge n 9 but once I opened the box to the 10+ I was instantly pleased with the looks alone!! I'm not very tech savvy but I'm learning how to do so much on my phone and the colors just pop! I would definitely reccomend this phone to everyone!! I love it!!"^5^March 28, 2019

Leafguy, ^480000580^31^0^"Everything I wanted and more! Unsure what these people are saying about the fingerprint scanner, wondering if they are using a screen protector. I mean, I recommend scanning at least 2 fingers 2-3 times each at every imaginable angle, but I do that with every fingerprint scanner on a phone. Anyway, the screen is so crisp and clear, Bixby Routines is actually pretty sweet, and I like that they moved the Bixby button a little further away from the volume button, i use to press it on accident way too often on my 8 and my 9, and you can set the bixby button up for another app, either with a single or a double press, SWEET! I nerd out on the settings everytime I get a new phone, watch multiple youtube videos, and try to figure out everything that I can do, you can do a lot. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"^5^March 23, 2019

Durability is enormously important to me because life cost money and I dont have money to keep buying new phones or broken screens. I once tripped while walking over an overpass and my phone fell atleast 3 stories down. ONLY A SCRATCH! I've been loyal ever since. I love S10+'s camera and new security features.

Prince Habibi, ^480000580^21^5^"The Galaxy S10+ is by far the best device you can buy at the moment. It has 3 pro grade cameras on the back and 2 on the front, both capable of UHD Video! The shots you can take on both are stunning and rich with detail. HDR 10+ really helps bring out the backgrounds! Samsung's New One UI is fluid and gorgeously simple. They took what made their previous skin great and added to it while slimming it down. The new phones also have reverse wireless charging, where when turned on, can charge any Qi enabled device such as a Galaxy Watch or Buds! Lastly, the screen is absolutely stunning. This is by far the best display you can get right now in typical Samsung fashion! Colors are bright, saturated and poppy and the QHD display is crisp and easy to read in direct sunlight."^5^February 25, 2019

Anyways today at work I forgot to take the phone off my hip. When it rang I picked it up to turn it off since i am in the middle of frying food.While trying to clip it back on it slipped out of my hand into the Fryer that is currently at 325 F, all I could do was rip the basket off and toss it and wait  for the oil to drop all the way down just for me to find my phone stuck between the coils and the wall of the fryer. All i could say was omg. My coworker and I got it out just find it fully functional, all I have done is turned it off as quickly as possible wipe it off as good as I can and stood it upright, hoping everthing drains out of the ports. 2h later we turned it on, and it worked just find besides of the sound, it has a snow like after sound. I got to say the S10+ is klutz prove for now, because I am the biggest klutz there is lol. Thanks Samsung for this Phone! I hope it keeps on working too lol"^5^June 8, 2019

man89, ^480000580^11^2^"I have purchased and used all samsung phone including s7 edge, s8+, s9+, note 9, and lastly s10+. I was quite happy to buy s8+ and s9+. Note 9 was alright because it did not feel any different from s9+. However my s10+ felt like a total garbage to note 9, idk why but it keeps having a problem (broken music, like it couldnt hold the connection) streaming to my sony 1000xm3, which seems to be validated by the galaxy buds that came with it that also have similar broken connection problem even after using the latest of updates. Using the same settings, my note 9 or s9+ never had any kind of problem streaming ldac optimized audio quality to my headphones. S10+ on screen fingerprint scanner is also too problematic because it failed too often. I tried to minimize this by using smart unlock, with connected devices, or location, but it ended up pocket calling random people, posting on social media, etc because it recognize the swipes and gestures while being in my pocket. Samsung failed me hard on this one."^1^April 10, 2019

Most activities and processes are performed faster.  Screen is bigger with only a smallest physical size increase.  Due to top to bottom display.

Greg from Baltimore, ^480000580^6^3^"I bought this Samsung 'flagship' phone just under a month ago through Verizon. I have yet to even make a payment on it. I've had issues with it since I purchased it. When the phone is in my pocket it tries to unlock itself, when I'm on my motorcycle and the phone is mounted the screen constantly comes on and swipes to prompt me to input my pin. I've been on with tech support from Verizon who offered to send me a 'factory refurbished' phone which is unacceptable. Now I'm being told by Samsung that I have to drive an hour away (one way) to go to a walk in service center before they will do anything else. Needless to say I won't be purchasing any more Samsung products considering they won't stand behind their newest phone. I've had Samsung phones since the Galaxy S3 and this is their absolute worst product I've ever purchased from them."^1^April 10, 2019

KDM Test Scores, ^480000580^5^1^"You spent the money, and bought (at least at the time of this review) the best phone in the category, from a manufacturer that has consistently provided the best handsets, and most capable hardware for Android users. Every noted feature and benefit performs as expected. This phone does what it says on the tin, and is painfully boring in that respect. Read the marketing gobbledy-gook, watch the reviews, its all true. I cannot think of a testing circumstance that I have encountered with this device where it has not met or exceeded the expectation of the manufacturer. This is the best phone that money can buy at the time of this review, and that is exactly the result of my purchase, testing, and daily of this device. I cannot give samsung 5 stars in any of the below category however, because I feel the product (as a line: S10e, S10, S10+) could have been a bit more refined in that, at launch the Galaxy S10 should have had advanced LTE+ (or whatever) AND 5G antennae. I dont think having a separate (and non-plus) 5G galaxy is an outright money grab, but I think it is possible the engineering might have been influenced by an expected  release date. The moral of the story is that, if you want the best, you will compromise, and as a consumer, if you want the best, you will pay for it regardless of brand loyalty."^4^May 18, 2019

Ringer gets silenced when I specifically maxed it waiting for a doctor's call. Visual voicemail never works. Screen rotation never works and I have it ON. Seems like they steps forward benefit the maker, not the user. The wrap edge screen just makes it hard to put down without opening something on the way to the stand and tthe sleekness, although nice to look at, makes it like a greased pig to hold. I had to get a case just to get a safe grip on it."^2^May 26, 2019

BritSkellz, ^480000580^4^0^"My thoughts might be slightly skewed as this is the first Samsung phone I've ever owned. Coming from an iPhone, the S10+ is more than I could have ever asked for. It was fairly easy to make the switch from iOS to an Android system and I am still learning something new each and every day. The pre-installed screen protector was a pleasant surprise when opening the box. Yes, the sides of the screen are very sensitive, I don't use Bixby (not my cup of tea), and the fingerprint scanner is finicky at times BUT it is not something that is such a burden that I will downgrade this amazing piece of technology. It teaches me patience in this world that is always on the go. I have smaller petite hands and I do not believe that the S10+ is too big. The display is beautiful, the battery life is perfect, the performance is superb, and the camera is amazing!! So much about this phone ensures me each and every day that I made the right switch at the right time for my needs and expectations. Thank you, Samsung!"^5^April 1, 2019

Techsee2, ^480000580^3^0^"After using a Note 5 for over 3 years, this new phone has both meet my expectations and exceeded them, though there are some attributes I don't care for. At first I was hesitant to upgrade but looking back, I can't say I regret doing so. The reasons I upgrade were because the battery of my note was reaching the end of it's usable life span and 32gb of storage just isn't enough. Throw in some 'lag' during normal operation, and I was ripe for a new phone. Other than that, the phone is fine. Bottom line is the reasons for upgrading aren't because the S10+ is such a great phone, but rather because my old phone becomes unpleasant to use. "^4^May 25, 2019
Another Disappointed User, ^480000580^3^5^"I really like all the features of the phone, but sadly it's going back because of one glaring defect...the Fingerprint Scanner SUCKS!!!!!!. I had ocassional problems with the scanner on my S9+ but it was very seldom. This scanner is just the opposite it seldom works. I have done the update that was put out because Samsung knows the scanner is junk and the update didn't help. I have deleted my fingerprints and reinstalled them numerous times to no avail. I have tried both hand lotion and licking my finger first as recommended on xda forums, again no luck. I get the scanner to work 1 out of 20 tries. You get locked out of your online bank accounts after so many false tries. I even took off the screensaver that Samsung shipped the phone with and still didn't help. So back it goes along with the earbuds, just hope I can get back my pristine S9+ that I traded in. Samsung has no business putting out a phone that's not ready for prime time. And before anyone comments that I don't know how to put my thumb or index finger properly on the display, I have tried light pressure, hard pressure and everything in between and still no luck. Anyone considering this phone should do an internet search about this problem first. For those that are having absolutely no problems with their phone congratulations I'm happy for you, but mine SUCKS!!."^1^March 15, 2019

Former Samsung Lover, ^480000580^3^1^"I had a Note 5 for several years and loved it. I thought getting the latest greatest from Samsung would be great but this phone just doesn't live up to all of the hype. The battery life is good so far. The picture/video quality is ok but not that much more impressive than my old Note 5. Bixby is useless and not needed and it would be nice if we could just disable it altogether rather than just remapping the button. That extra button is annoying and I often push it on accident while trying to lower the volume. The curved edge screen is the biggest downer. With a case on, the screen is higher than the case, at least on the sides, and the curved edges get scratched easily. The screen protector that came on the phone bubbled up once I put the case on it and it wouldn't stay down. I hate that I bought this phone without seeing it in person with a case and seeing the extra stupid Bixby button. I think I will move on to another brand on my next go around, especially if the curved edge screens are still around. Those are the worst feature by far."^2^April 15, 2019

They linked notifications to the badge icons so when you dismiss the notification the badge on the app goes away too (this is with EVERY app). You either have to have a home screen full of notifications that every one can see or you have no badge on your app to remind you that you have unread emails, snapchats, tweets, facebook notifications, etc. This makes all android phones useless.

LindsayDD215, ^480000580^3^0^"First impressions: I've had my S10+ for a couple of days now and I'm loving it. I wasn't sure if the hole punch camera was going to bug me but I barely notice it after only a couple days. This phone (Prism White) is not only beautiful but it functions great. The response time is extremely fast, the cameras and the screen resolution is AMAZING. I personally got the 128GB version since it has an SD card slot for extra storage. I have the fingerprint sensor and face recognition setup (as well as passcode). Both of them work great. You can unlock the phone with fingerprint even with the screen off after getting used to where it is and it is visible with the screen on. Face recognition is very quick and I've actually accidentally unlocked it a couple of times just by picking it up! Coming from the S9+ with the fingerprint sensor on the back, this is much better. It took so long to get used to it on the back but no time to get used to it on the screen. So great that it comes with a screen protector. Don't have to worry about finding one that works with the on-screen fingerprint scanner. Wireless charging is great. Love that I can charge other phones as well as my Galaxy buds with it. So far, I'm very happy I switched!"^5^March 8, 2019

Shawn Christopher, ^480000580^3^0^"Upgrading from the S8 which is a great phone in of itself. This Samsung Galaxy S10+ is hands down the best phone I've ever owned.  it's sleek design makes this phone so slim it slips in and out of my pockets with ease.  The screen is the most beautiful on the market full stop.  It's much brighter and cleaner than even my wife's i-phone x.  After seeing my new S10+ she may be the latest i-phone convert.  It's lighting fast.  I just installed USB 3.1 ports on my desktop computer and i literally transferred 450 mb of photos that i had originally transferred from my old phone at least twice as fast as i would have before.  Seemingly transferred in the blink of an eye.  The prism blue is just a stunning color. After having the phone a few days now, I can  now say with confidence.  The messaging is much faster and has a few nicer more intuitive features (using Message + with Verizon). Snappier response times from all apps and functions overall.  I'm a sound engineer by trade, so I love making my own ringtones and they upload with ease to the S10 + and play beautifully through its Dolby Atmos speakers.  I have extensive LED lighting throughout my home and control all of it through Amazon Alexa which works seamlessly with the S10+ . I use my spottily premium account to listen to my playlists in my Honda CRV which also paired  via Bluetooth with the S10+ with out even a slight hiccup The camera is a very clear, standout upgrade and has really impressed me with it's ultra-wide field of view.  I use it a lot for taking pictures and videos, mostly of my wife and 2 kids. As a side note.  I got an s10 e for my son.  Its his first phone. I did NOT order p[protective cases in time for the arrival of the phones, but i thought it wouldn't be a problem since it would only be a couple of days before they arrived and we would mostly be using the phones around the house....well,  we both dropped our phones a couple of times during that weekend and by Sunday had noticed scratches om the screen.  we were both pretty bummed ,  they were not terrible scratches, but scratches none the less that we got on our brand new phones after only a day or 2.  we thought we would just have to deal with them for now...BUT ................I completely forgot, until I noticed and little glimmer on the edge of the screen,  THEY  SHIP WITH STOCK SCREEN PROTECTORS!!! When we peeled them back, revealing or once again pristine screens we were so happy,they really saved the day for us. I would highly recommend this phone.  Its gorgeous, its fast.  it's seamless.  It's the best you can get.  I was unsure whether or not I really wanted to upgrade just yet.  I'm SO glad I did."^5^March 13, 2019

My s9+, with the capacitive sensor on the back, worked flawlessly, but you had to pick the phone up to unlock it. I went for the s10+ because I thought I would be able to unlock the phone while it is laying face up, but unfortunately that is not the case.

rainy23796, ^480000580^1^1^"Within 2 days of having the phone, I was hiking and the phone--which is not too friendly in size for small hands--slipped from my hand and fell on the path. The screen was face down and when I turned it over, the entire screen was shattered and did not function. The screen was black, all I could see was a thin line at the top, showing that the phone was on. I had the liquid glass on the phone that was put on in the Verizon store, I understand it only protects from scratches and this was far more than a scratch. I had on a Otterbox Defender and obviously this was not adequate. The reason I complain is that I have had a Samsung Galaxy 5 and 7 in the past and had my history of dropping the phones on concrete, asphalt, rocks. The screens were far more durable to drop testing/impact. I had each of those phones for a 3 year time periods and the only reason I upgraded each time was for technology performance. The phones at most suffered a small crack of the screens, but they still functioned well with NO issues. I am disappointed that the S10+ screen is significantly fragile. I do not particularly like the curved screen, I feel that this increases the risk for damage to the screen. The screen was completely disabled with the cracked screen, I had a heck of a time retrieving my pictures and memory from the phone with no screen- I had to use a computer to transfer everything. Otherwise, the phone has great function for camera features, there are 5 cameras which is interesting. I am still learning my new phone (I replaced the damaged new S10+ with the insurance offered for the device-I highly recommend that everyone purchase the insurance to in the case of need to replace the device like I did). I find that the 4G and internet function seems slow, I am not sure if that is the device's fault. The default app for messages is not my favorite, I am unable to customize this, and long messages appear as a file, which is weird. The phone like I said, is large and bulky, making it awkward to hold, but the visual aspect is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^3^July 1, 2019

Formerandroidlover, ^480000580^1^2^"I have owned Galaxy phones for years and have been very happy.  So much so that I am the only person in my company with an Android phone and had no interest in switching to an iPhone.  After 3 years with an S7 and no longer having decent battery life it was time to upgrade.  Unfortunately all the fancy bells and whistles that the S10 has are lost on me as I use my phone primarily for voice texting, calling (go figure!) and taking pictures. My Galaxy 7 had some quirks with voice texting and my hope was that there would be improvements in the 3 years since buying my 7.  I could not have been more wrong! I do not have an accent of any sort and had decent accuracy with the 7 but the 10 has been horrible for accuracy, capitalizes the first letter of a word every time there is a pause in texting, does not recognize capitalization (typing out period 50% of the time rather than actually ending a sentence) does not offer suggested words when I move the cursor (CONSTANTLY) to fix a mispelling and then deletes the entire word when I am trying to fix a letter or 2.... I could go on and on about how HORRIBLE the voice texting is but I think this gets the point across. This alone makes me wish I went ahead with an iPhone purchase.  "^1^December 13, 2019

Buhnayuh, ^480000580^1^1^"Not sure how people are giving a 5 star review before the phone released.... however I will say that performance is quick, coming from the iPhone X it takes some getting used to navigating Samsung's oneUI. last time I had one was the s5 and s6edge, and they've really stepped it up from there. The only downside is some aspects of the camera, some features look far better than expected on a phone but others kind of fall short. Dont get me wrong the cameras are good but definitely not the best. Personally the OS and UI Samsung has on this phone, works for me and the camera isn't something I generally look to have the best of on a smart phone."^5^March 9, 2019

However, I upgraded to a S10, while I do love the phone, I have a major problem that there doesn't seem to be a fix. There is a call duration screen that pops up after every call. It doesn't matter if it is an outgoing or incoming call. This call duration screen pops up. There is NO way you can turn it off. When I had my Galaxy S5 there was an option that allowed me to turn off 'call duration'. I would think that an upgrade from a S5 to a S10 would still have that feature.

It is very frustrating to have apps stop running due to forced OS upgrades that are not possible on a phone.  I'm very glad that I upgraded to this iPhone because it is better in almost every way, and there is no Tracfone prohibition against future OS upgrades since they are done from Apple.  I've already upgraded the iOS to the latest version 12.2, and all apps run quickly and smoothly.

I also us it in CarPlay mode in my 2016 Honda Civic - if you drive and use it a lot of your data (same for roaming - turn it off it not needed) that you may have to top up rather quickly. Also note that the phone is locked (by Tracfone) in the first year of ownership. After 1 year, you can call their tech support to unlock it.

jmiller, ^702494549^1^0^"So I've been an android fan/user for the past 3 years but I recently purchased a macbook and ipad and liked them so much I decided to give the iphone a try, but didn't want to splurge on one of the later models until I was sure I was comfortable using ios. Well I've had the phone for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say I probably will never go back to android. 

The phone is in fact BRAND NEW, comes sealed with instruction booklet, headphones and charger, as well as a sim card (the sim card slot opener is underneath the phone holder in the box in an envelope, use that and not a paperclip).  If you already have an apple id account setting up is a breeze. I was able to transfer over most of my apps from my android using the Move to IOS app on my Samsung phone. If you have straight talk your service will now be under tracfone but you still pay through straight talk and buy straight talk monthly plans. 

The 32 GB of space is more than enough, I didn't transfer the 2,000 photos I had on my camera roll from my old phone, instead I uploaded them to google photos on my old phone, then downloaded the google photos app on my iphone and chose which photos I wanted to transfer to my phone. I was initially worried about not having expandable memory like I did on my other androids, but after installing all of my apps and downloading my itunes library, I still have about 14GB of storage left 

The camera is probably one of my favorite features. Coming from an 8MP phone and going to a 12MP phone, was a huge deal to me. I take lots of photos for work so having a good camera is a must. I like the live photo feature that allows me to take photos and takes like a 3 second video with each one. The screen is very nice and vibrant I also love the touch ID feature, I no longer have to use my password on certain secure apps on my phone. I also like the fact this phone comes with a headphone jack, unlike the 7, 8 or X  series. Syncing my iphone to my macbook and ipad is another great feature. With icloud, I can take a picture with my phone and have them automatically show up on my macbook and ipad. I also enabled the sync over wifi that way I can sync my itunes library to my iphone without using an USB cord

Overall, for the price this phone is a steal. I know it's almost 5 years old but I think if you'd like to try out an Iphone without breaking the bank this phone is perfect. 

*I suggest getting the square trade 2 year warranty. For $50 you get a piece of mind that if you drop your phone, spill a drink or have mechanical failure, you don't have to pay out of pocket. There is a $29 deductible but I find that very reasonable considering the cost to fix any issue with your phone will cost AT LEAST $50."^5^March 19, 2019

Kept getting 'Not enough money on this account.' Spent 3 days on the phone with them to get it fixed. The 'fix' in their system would work for perhaps a few minutes and drop me again. When I told them I wanted a refund on the card because their service was failing me, their response was that 'It was not the card's fault' !? and 'We cannot refund you for the card.' So when I pointed out how that they were about to lose a household of service (3 phones in my household) over $30, they were unapologetic and ambivalent.

I have shopped for a number of months and I have had a few plans from other carriers. Since this plan allows me to call Canada and with all the other features, I have never been able to find any other cell phone plan that comes close. I would highly recommend it and if you don't need the international calling the $45 unlimited plan is the greatest national plan available. I know I have shopped and I keep looking to be sure."^5^August 15, 2013

I used to get excellent network in Elmsford (NY). Then I shifted to Mount Kisco (NY) which is about 15 miles up north and boom! Poor sound quality for international calls and the data speed at 3G feels like it's GPRS. So, do talk to people who live in your neighborhood if Straight Talk has good network there."^2^June 1, 2014

I was very shocked and pleased with the LG phone and it's speed. The screen is large enough for me to do whatever it is i need to do.

The hotspot covers 5 devices, too.  2 years ago we dumped Verizon after being customers for many years, separated cell service (pageplus) and mobile Internet (straighttalk) and saved nearly 10 times on our cell phone bill, paying only for what we need in cell service, separately, and mobile Internet, separately, without any surcharges or overages."^5^April 21, 2017

The processor is great once you accelt that with only 2 GB of ram that you will spend alot of time waiting for the device to catch ul or flat out unfreeze. I like the sizeable display however the touch calibration is again garbage for texting. This handsat comes with 16GB less hd space available then other prepaid companies it has less ram and costs and costs more for as usual infuriatingly not to mention purposefully dumbed down equipment that just doesnt deliver on the level that it should. Thank you guys for as always being willing to take my $55.00 every month which is fine thats a good deal for the service but then $200.00 for this incapable of multitasking fluidly system storage overloaded with bloatware and just lacking hardware is crazy.

Heresthetruth, ^381147781^4^0^"This is not the lg stylo 4 you've read about but a stripped down pitiful clone by straight talk. But you won't know that until after purchase. It is only 16gb not 32. It loaded with preinstalled junk you can't uninstall which uses 8gb. You can buy the unbranded, unlocked, no carrier version for same price. At $199.00 up front, you think you own this phone? No! You must carry a straight talk plan for at least a year. Then will they unlock it who knows or cares It's obsolete upon purchase. It's so bloated, slow, stripped down.  Slower processor and same storage as from phones 7 years ago.  Want a better phone? Old Galaxy s4  phone is faster and not stripped down like this phone.  Don't even think about getting customer service. When you first set up they will have cs speak to you you can understand. After that it rings to overseas where you get a bot and finally a cs that you can't understand due to non english. First week of purchase charger cord will not charge. Junk. Result? Straight talk wants to run tests on phone.. For a charger cord? But you must be on a different phone??  Everytime no matter what it is 4 and 5 hours on phone until you give up. And forget renewing time with their app. Won't work. So you have to call and call and text and text.. Then you have no idea what they've charged to your card until email. Then it's nonrefundable. Ultimate Unlimited is not unlimited and not $55.00 but over $60+ Checknout the Reddit forums. There is NO 1 year warranty but straightalk will sell you one. Also you must send in you new phone and do without until they decide if they'll send you one back. Not a new phone but refurbished. There is so much more than even this you need to know. Beware! RUN DON'T WALK from straight talk, this phone and walmart's sales pitch. They all should be ashamed. This is the second review I've typed. Doubt this one is posted either."^1^October 19, 2018

ShaneD, ^381147781^1^0^"I've had a Note 4 since early 2015 and it's got to where it has to be charged at least twice a day even with a new battery. After owning the Note 2 and 4 I've come to want the stylus for notes and just scribbling around. Looked at the Note 9 but the price is ridiculous so I started searching for other options. A local Wal-Mart store had a Stylo 4 on display and the big screen jumped out at me. Upon further examination I saw it had a stylus which was a huge plus. At $199.99 the price was right because even if I just get a year of good use out of it I won't feel ripped off. The store didn't have it in stock so I ordered it online and picked it up a few days later. Setup was easy, within 10 minutes I had all my info changed over from my Note. The screen is nice and bright but where this phone shines for me is battery life. I got the phone on Monday and charged it full that night. Nearly 48 hours later I still have 46% battery left so it will have made it 2 full days one a single charge. People complain about the RAM and all that but the phone is faster than my Samsung with much better battery life. So if you want a phone with a big screen and great battery life without spending a thousand dollars definitely think about this phone."^5^September 12, 2018

noah.d18, ^392750061^71^13^"I purchased the G7 from the first day it came out and decided to give up my g6 for it, since I was passing it down. It is a very large improvement on the terms of performance and software, as well as overall design. The screen is definitely one of the best Ive seen on a Motorola phone and the notch is easy to get used to almost instantly. Camera is about the same as the g6; its faster and more snappy but struggles a title more in low-light photos. Finally, the screen is great, but most apps do not support such a new and large screen ratio. I loved the symmetry of 18:9 but now since the ratio is bigger, the to half is just a black bar with no curvature. Doesn't look very attractive with a curved bottom half of the screen and a squared top especially since it adds more of a bezel with the black. Other than that, everything is great. I would defiantly recommend this phone to anyone beginning  to start off with a Motorola, or someone who is looking for amazing features in a small price range."^4^May 30, 2019

As an actual phone, it SUCKS. Really, really SUCKS. Call volume fluctuates, calls drop. I can hear the caller just fine, but feedback is that they can only sometimes hear me. So if your device is for pictures and social media, this is a good buy. If you're in Sales (like me) and need to actually talk to people to make money, buy something else."^3^April 10, 2019

With today's mobile technology, I cannot believe that Motorola would not include something efficient that people use on a regular basis.  So many great features on the G7, but the lack of NFC is making me consider returning it.

sc_country, ^392750061^4^0^"I had a Moto X4 that needed replacement. Of course they discontinued the X series, so there is really no good replacement option in the US, because the g7 Plus is not offered here (dumb move, Motorola! g7 Plus would have been a perfect x4 replacement).  So after always having seen great reviews of the g-series, I went with the g7. For me, I am not someone who's always on the phone. I use it for text, quick email replies, to check Facebook, weather and news, and take pics. I would rather use a PC when possible. So the top thing I value are basic things like size/good feeling in-hand, and camera quality. The size of the g7 is perfect for most people. The screen, while a bit dim, has great clarity for the price. It is faster than my x4 was. My one major complaint is the camera quality, and that is where I believe the g7 Plus would have been better given the specs, but again not available in the US. My x4 camera blew me away for the price. But the g7 camera is slower to focus, I often get blurry pics even in well-lit conditions (forget about low-light photos), and the detail is not good. I realize the g7 is a cheaper phone than the x4, but not by much. And given the specs, and typical incremental improvement, I expected more. So I would not recommend the g7 as a replacement for the x4. The camera is not good, which is unfortunate because the rest of the phone is solid."^4^March 31, 2019
^392750061^3^2^"First off, the dark mode is no dark mode. The only thing that changes is the navigation screen, dock background, and app screen. Everything else is still very white. This makes it pointless in my opinion. Also, there are no other fonts to use other then the very boring, very hard to read one font that is installed. There is no bold font, nothing. For people that has bad vision, this not good. You can change the size of the font, or the size of the display, but it does NOT change the fact you can't see the fonts to easily be able to read it. And, you can not download other fonts because the phone is not rooted.. which will  void the warranty. This is a big no no, I should have control of what fonts I want to use and to make it bold. And your 'dark' mode is just useless at best."^2^July 3, 2019

Moons, ^392750061^1^0^"Bought the Moto g7 a couple weeks ago and it works great! My mom also loves the Moto g6 that came with it as well. I was hoping to find a phone with a good camera, both front facing as well as back facing, and it was great to find that photo and video quality is awesome in both phones. The portrait mode is great, but I'm not sure if I'm not using it properly, or if it might just be a glitch, where it does not sense all of what I'm trying to focus/blur out. The overall smoothness of the features is satisfying, not only in-app, but switching between different apps, too. The customizing ability and features make for easier use, and I've been able to set up the phone the way I like. Originally I was not sure if I liked the teardrop design where the camera lens is, and come to find there is an option in the settings to change it so the screen does not show the teardrop (however, I did decide to keep the teardrop feature, it's pretty cool, and it definitely grew on me!) They both came very quickly, and turbo chargers were provided in the packaging. The phones are sleek and stylish, and comfortable in hand! We're still learning all the features, but the phones have a steep learning curve, and even if there is confusion, the 'motorola experience' option shows you exactly what to do. Overall great experience so far, and the battery life is great too! Great phone for the price, plus the free g6 deal doesn't hurt either!"^4^October 31, 2019

The battery charges real fast and is a plus since I am on the go all the time.  I love how the phone is virtually a stock Android OS and does not have any fluff stuff on top of it.

tomseys, ^579326233^75^4^"I bought this Samsung Galaxy J3 Orbit smartphone to replace my trusty and excellent Samsung Galaxy J3 Luna Pro... the Orbit is an upgrade in a number of areas, including a faster octa core processor, more RAM at 2GB versus 1.5Gb  and better cameras giving us 8MP and 5MP shooters versus the Luna Pro's 5/2 cameras. Overall, I like the phone.. it's fast, comes with Oreo 8.0 and takes good pictures,..clearer pictures than the Luna Pro. The call quality is good, and with the voLTE switch on in mobile networks, it has HD Voice with sounds great. I like the 5 inch screen size it has just like the Luna Pro since for me this is easier to carrier than the increasingly popular 5.5 inch size. My only complaint is the screen is a little sensitive so I sometimes end up touching it with parts of my hand while holding it which changes the home screen mode. I'm making adjustments to deal with it. I've only had the Orbit a few days now so time will tell how well it really performs, but so far, I think its a pretty good phone and I'm glad I bought it.

You could by 3 of the 50 dollar cards and get 15 gigs of data for 150 or buy 2 of these and get 14 gigs of data for 150. This option really makes no sense to me.

I was there 3 weeks, got a $75. card  and when I left I gave the whole thing to the Granddaughter as she was going to college and an internet connection was very handy.

This phone first off is just beautiful, and has premium feel to it like a more expensive phone. Screen is nice, I can see it well outside in sun. Calls sound clear for me, even out of state calls were good. Apps load up quick, whole phone is quick.  Camera will take a nice selfie in good lighting. Back camera can take some good pics in well lit lighting, in dim lighting pics can get grainy. Memory is good, you get around 9 out of 16 which isn't too bad, i added an SD Card to move apps and have 6 Gb free.  Battery lasted good woth moderste use, even using it more than moderate with the kind of battery it has it lasts all day! Sound quality is loud unless your in a noisy room.

Also the alarm clock will not acknowledge my finger gesture to turn it off, I have to open the clock app to turn off (the snooze works though). The battery life is also disappointing, it's at 50% typically after @6hrs of music through the bluetooth (not using any data, I download all my music).

JoshMc2442, ^916233131^3^0^"This phone was my first intro to the Edge feature. The Edge feature has a purpose and I can see the selling point to it, but for me it doesn't really serve a purpose. I can navigate other ways much faster than using the edge feature. It also weakened the durability of the phone. I always boasted on the durability of my Galaxy, but this version I ran through two in a matter of months due to accidental drops on the 'edge'. These drops were with a case on it also so I was a bit disappointed in that. When I got my final phone i was very careful with it and it lasted me roughly a year without any breaks cracks or damage. As with most Samsung devices the hardware is hard to beat. Feels great in the hand, heavy yet very lightweight. Camera is dynamite, video is great. Software at times is lacking and sometimes it will lag and drag. Its a small price to pay for the allowance of being outside the box ad being able to download apps from anywhere from anyone. Unless Samsung does some really messed up stuff (like take away the microSD again....i waited 2yrs cause i refused to buy the s6 without the microSD) I'll always be a Samsung guy......I have the s8 early assessment.....its awesome!!!!"^5^April 20, 2017

GalaxyLover98, ^916233131^3^0^"To start off this phone was purchased as a replacement for the Galaxy NOTE 7 I had.. However since they recalled it is figured I'd get this phone instead because it was the next big thing. I'm surprised that I actually like this phone better than the Galaxy Note 7. I'm not sure it it was because I had the blue note 7 & I got a black 7 edge. But I'm glad that I like it better. The camera is phenomenal! I loveeee that it has a flash in the front facing camera. The phone quality is absolutely excellent. I also love the battery life on this phone. It is practically in my hand almost every second and after I put it down it is no less than 50%. If you are considering to buy this phone stop thinking about it and get it!! It really is the best phone out right now!

It took a little getting good used to regarding the smaller size but I'm loving it so far. The battery lasts a long time (hours of Pokémon playing without a needed charge) and man does it charge fast when it's time. The camera takes amazing pictures and maneuvering around the phone is as easy as it has always been. I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for an upgrade or a change of brand. Regarding the reviews about it flying out of your hands, it is light. I bought a clear rubber case for it (I wanted to see the gold tone of the phone) and it stays securely in my hand, no slipping."^5^August 3, 2016

askmad, ^916233131^2^0^"I started with the GalaxyS3, then went to the Galaxy S5 and now the Galaxy S7 I love this phone, I considered the S6 when it came out, but changed my mind as it didn't have the removable Micro SD card slot. They brought it back in the S7.. Transferring everything from the S5 to the S7 was so easy and great! This phone lives up to the Great Galaxy reputation. I would recommend this phone to everyone whether and android or apple users. I have quite a few people ask me about the phone when they find out what i have and I tell them it is well worth purchasing. I have small hands and I love that the screen area has not shrunk, but the width and thickness of the phone has. I have a much easier time holding the S7."^5^May 16, 2016

MusicLvr, ^916233131^2^0^"I haven't had a new phone since 2010, and was quite excited about getting this phone, I know someone who has an older generation of it and theirs is quite durable, they have had several small dropping accidents and not a scratch on it. Now to clarify I am very careful with electronics but there are those occasional mishaps that just aren't expected (my old phone didn't have one dent and only a small scratch after all those years. My new phone wasn't even 2 weeks old and I was standing on the boardwalk, standing, not walking and I had just taken some pictures, which I will admit this phone does quite nicely, when I was done with the pictures I put my arms down and was watching the waves my hands were sweating because it was hot and the phone slipped out of my hands and straight down to the ground. My new expensive phone now has 2 scratches and 2 matching dents. Anything else that was this much and of this poor durablility would have immediately been returned. But that is the fallback with the cell industry now at days since you're kind of stuck with it. I asked the place where I purchased it and they told me Samsung went more for looks that durability on the s7, which I feel after seeing the commercials for the s7 that made them very misleading as for how well these were built."^1^June 7, 2016

OGCaptivate, ^916233131^2^0^"I have owned a Galaxy phone since the first one that Samsung produced, Captivate. I started smartphones with an 'I' competitor which was very advanced for the time but Samsung soon pushed far ahead of the competition. My last phone was a Galaxy S5 and I was not able to get the S6 due to my new carrier contract and now I have the chance to upgrade to a new phone, S7 Edge, and I have to tell you that the features and user friendliness of this phone are fantastic! I am still finding new cool things this phone can do just by adding new apps and looking thru the settings menu. The edge part of the phone is very helpful to get quick info, jump to a app or open a photo. Plus if yo are a new user to these phones there is the easy use option that allows you to do the basic things and clearly puts them out for you on the screen. Easy Peezy. The slim design and the fact that it is dust and waterproof make this a no-brainer when it comes to choosing a phone. Thumbs up to you Samsung for another fine product!"^5^December 21, 2016

SamsungSquirrel515, ^916233131^2^0^"This phone is flat out the best phone I have ever had or had the pleasure in testing. It does everything and has everything. The camera is spectacular. The camera might not seem like much being a 12mp camera but duel lense and low light focus is out of this world. Easily the best camera on a phone to date. The features and tech specs of this phone is amazing. The big battery lasts for hours on in and I'm just really blown away by this phone to say the least. I would definitely recommend this phone to family and friends. I had the note 2 before this phone so you could say I was living in the stone age so you would see my amazement with this phone lol. I actually have tested other phones like the iPhone 6 and 7 also the note 5 and the new moto and lg g5 along with the LG v20. Aldo just recently tried out the new Google pixel XL and I still have to say that the s7 is superior in every way. The only phone that comes close is the Google Pixels and that's only because of the unlimited storage capacity which is just flat out ridiculously amazing lol. GET THE GALAXY S7!!!

Not too hard to hold one handed or get into and out of my pocket. Doesn't slip all over the place. I do use a case and applied a screen protector.

^916233131^1^0^"I upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge from a Galaxy S6 Edge+ and am very happy I did. It doesn't get hot at all like the S6 edge+ and the software seems better, more user friendly! The only complaint I have is that the glass is not strong enough. I broke the back glass the first week I had it when I dropped it while sitting in a chair and was devastated because it shattered. It should have a metal back for this reason. Since then I have purchased a case and now you aren't able to tell it's cracked but I know! Also I highly doubt it's water resistant at this point. I'm looking into replacing the back glass but if it's too expensive I'll just leave it like it is. On another note the tempered glass I purchased at the same time I purchased the case didn't hold up to its hammer on the screen advertising because I dropped it again, this time on its face and it shattered it. On the upside I was able to remove the tempered glass without any damage to the screen, so I would recommend getting one of those as fast as possible! The downside of the tempered glass on the edge is that once installed, if you have a case on your phone, the edge tab is pretty well inaccessible until you learn how to apply the right amount of pressure at the right angle to get it to work! Also it's very heavy, even without a case. At night when I'm laying in bed, I often have to lay my arms down and rest them for a few seconds due to the tremendous weight of it! But, if you are reading this I urge you to get one despite the cons I just gave to you. I'm almost positive you'll fall in love with your Galaxy S7 Edge just as I did!"^5^September 9, 2016

I don't like how the gallery is set up now. I really hate the fact that the quick contact bubbles at the top of the messages app are gone. I also don't like that in order to send a group message I have to scroll down all my contacts. It was so much simpler before.

ChrislynnK, ^916233131^1^0^"I upgraded from the galaxy s4 about 3 weeks ago. Initially loved the new S7 but have recently started having issues with it restarting itself, and not being able to navigate some apps. My husband also upgraded from the S4 to the S7 the same day I did. He is also having problems with his new phone, however his major problem is he cannot get any service unless he is connected to WiFi for some reason. Also both of us, even though all notifications are turned on the phones will not notify us when we get text messages or certain other notifications. I am very frustrated that we are both having problems especially with the cost of the phones. Some positives on the other hand include excellent camera, expandable memory, and sleek design. A little difficult to type on but at least you can make the keyboard bigger. The phone also comes with headphones in a nice little case but the new design of the headphones it awful. They are solid plastic with rubber covers that come in 2 sizes, but it doesn't matter what size you use they are very uncomfortable unless you're ears are just the right size and shape. The headphonesecond that came with our S4s were much more comfortable and had better sound."^3^April 29, 2016

Loved the way it performed, the way it felt in my hand. Felt well made. (Upgraded from a BLU phone product) then that fell and broke recently... worst day of my life! I already had my eye on the 7 edge though. Perfect time to upgrade! I thought to myself. So I bought this sweet sleek Ness and just wow! Even faster, doesn't heat up on vr.

The speakers are great for a phone and it wasn't difficult to move information from my old Samsung phone to my new phone. I have really found that Samsung's customer service is one of the best across all its products. I buy their televisions, phones tablets because of their commitment to product quality. It came with the 'mind blowing' VR gear which was awesome. It was an amazing promotional incentive. Thank you!"^5^September 24, 2016

rsoverman, ^916233131^1^0^"I had a 6S Edge that lasted 18 months before I had trouble hooking up a charger. I liked it a lot and went with the 7S Edge as a replacement. I really like this phone too, including the external card option and the getting wet issue. BUT, I have a problem with Bluetooth. I listen to audiobooks all the time. With Bluetooth, there is a split second hesitation(sounds like a stutter) about every 15 seconds. This is with the LG Tone headset. With the Mpow Jaws headset, the split second hesitation turns into 1 - 2 seconds. With regular headphones, no problem. I don't know if the bluetooth issue is with AT&T or with Samsung, but I'm betting Samsung. I have a holster type case and took it off. The hesitation is still there, but not as pronounced. I would still get the Samsung Edge next time. I hope they fix the bluetooth issue. I'm sure it's not a problem listening to music since music is background noise and audiobook is more foreground."^5^October 2, 2016

SmarTechguy, ^916233131^1^0^"This phone is by far the best phone i have ever owned. I'm big on technology and every year I have to get the newest latest and greatest. Last year I went with note 4 instead of s6 only due to no expandable memory. I love this phone. This is the first edge phone I've owned. The edge takes some getting used to due to the way I hold it in my hand. With a case it actually made a huge difference. Samsung pay is amazing. The integrated contact option to take a picture of a business card works really well and makes it really easy. Everything about this phone is top of the line. I gave it four stars just due to the edge being touchy. I have already recommended this phone to everyone and will be buying my third for my brother. My wife is not a big techy but she as well loves this phone. She's big on taking pictures off the kids and loves the better updated camera. The bio-metric scanner is seamless. On the note 4 it would take 4 tries to unlock themail phone. The s7 first try to the point that I press the home button to check the time and it unlocks and opens the phone. It's amazing!!!!"^5^March 24, 2016
Bamdunn, ^916233131^1^0^"After 2 weeks, I really miss my S6 edge. It was an excellent phone. The gaming performance of this phone is the best (for approximately 1 minute 20 seconds). After 2 minutes the frame rate is half that of my s6 edge. The in-game recording feature does not work well. If the performance of the phone stayed the same and the back camera of the phone was the same as the s6 edge, I would love this phone. The new camera on this phone takes square shaped photos instead of the wide screen ones all the other phones take. The low light photos do not come out that well on this phone."^1^March 27, 2016

Snaveebag, ^916233131^1^0^"This is, hands down, the best android experience to date. Fast, and capable of anything you can throw at it. If the plastic build of the past has kept you away from the Galaxy S line, now is the time to give this a try. The Galaxy S7 Edge fits well in the hand and and is probably the most sleek phone around at this time in my opinion. The glass on the back, though beautiful, is slippery, but the curves give it a great feel in the hand. The notification light that I miss from certain manufacturers is included with this device. Camera is excellent in low light and focus' immediately, don't let the drop in megapixels from the last generation fool you. Photos come out better than previous builds, due to the larger camera sensor allowing more light to pass through, in return, higher quality photos. Battery life with my normal use is about a day, usually ending in the evening around 30-40% in my case. In my opinion you cant go wrong with this device."^5^July 12, 2016

GarlicSquash, ^916233131^1^0^"I recently upgraded from my previous Galaxy S4 and this is a huge step up.

I actually like that the form factor was reduced slightly, I don't notice it with respect to screen size, but one-handed operation is much easier than with the S4.

The camera experience was the best I have seen on a smartphone especially in low light. My favorite experience is the battery life and I can easily last up to two full days and with fast charging and ultra power saving mode, there is no way I could have my phone die on me in the middle of the day.

HylianKnight, ^916233131^1^0^"The phone works great out of the box, and after spending some time digging through the settings, I find it easy to find what I need, and what all the features do. The ability to capture screenshots from webpages, and continue capturing for that uninterrupted effect, is a great plus. Camera quality is fantastic, and a definite step up from my S4 Mini(even though, I'll be honest, the mini as a whole was pretty great too). Chose this over the S7 Edge because I prefer to not have those curved screen edges. Gonna take some getting used to in terms of size, and still slightly miffed that the background wallpaper isn't scrollable anymore(yes, still). Has included face chat feature for those who also have an S7. So if you know a bunch of friends who didnt' jump onboard the iPhone bandwagon, or are looking to switch, but held off due to the facetime, this has got ya covered. Expandable memory up to 200GB, but you'll have to wait to get home to upgrade since it requires a special tool(comes with it) to access the memory slot. Non removable battery is another feature, but not sure if I'm happy about that just yet. Time will tell. Yes, it's also pretty smudgy, but that's what cases are for."^5^March 16, 2016

Mitch55, ^916233131^1^0^"The most beautiful phone out there. Fast and responsive.

Certainly not a deal breaker, but I'd like to see that flexibility added in an upgrade, or at the least, added to future gen's of the Galaxy......Mitch"^5^December 9, 2016

randerton, ^916233131^1^0^"I got my new S7 Edge about two weeks ago in early March, 2016. I previously had an S5 so waited for the waterproof version with an SD card and better battery life; hence, my rationale for skipping the S6. So far, I really like the S7 Edge - I added a 64MB SD card which has been great. I have not tried loading applications to the SD card yet but understand that can be done if the app will support it. I really like the waterproof feature without requiring the little flap the S5 had over the micro-USB power connection. I also like the wireless power charging and rapid charging features - both of which were not present on my S5. In addition, I've had very good luck with the camera on the S7 so far. The battery life is much improved over my S5 in that I can get through a day now without requiring charging for the most part. I could not do that with my S5. The Marshmellow OS and core apps have performed perfectly so far - I was having issues on my S5 so I'm also happy with this change."^5^March 22, 2016

Ryan11181, ^916233131^1^0^"The galaxy s7 edge in my opinion and my experience for me didn't quite live up to all the hype. Yes the camera works great and takes great pictures. It's usually pretty fast responding. .from time to time it gets slow and sluggish and doesn't want to respond right away. I've had it restart on me by itself automatically. The biggest issue for me is the battery life. With it on airplane mode and background apps restricted and in power saving mode I get close to maybe 12-13 hours of battery life and that's if i don't use it too much. If I use it i get less than 13 hours. An issue with it being slow is happening as I type. I'm typing and it's taking a few seconds for words to show up and if I need to delete it takes a few seconds for the phone to respond to delete.

MDG90, ^916233131^1^0^"I've had the S7 Edge for about a week, and so far it's been great. I love the new edge software features, the fingerprint scanner is quick and accurate, camera is gorgeous, and it looks amazing.

Rmcleskey, ^916233131^1^0^"I really do love this hardware. I feel like I'm from the future when I'm holding it. Unfortunately, I don't feel so futuristic when I'm using it. While many of the software features are great and the os is overall pretty stable, the lack of fluidity can be fairly jarring. Just today I had to restart the phone because it was exhibiting symptoms of a memory leak (extreme lag and then apps like the keyboard closing and restarting while using them). Also, the fluidity of animations leaves a little more polish desired. If Samsung were to just polish up the software a bit more I could comfortably say this is the best phone you can buy."^4^March 25, 2016

Color replication on pictures is accurate and vivid. Display is a very generous size and looks crisp and bright. No dead pixels either. This phone is a great investment.

I got this phone as soon as it came out and I expected some bugs or things I wouldn't like but I have been I love everything about it. One of my favorite features is the fingerprint scanner. I love the fact that I can handle my phone whether in my pocket or hand and not have to worry about accidentally unlocking it or 'butt dialing' anyone and I don't have to enter a password everytime. It's handy when it comes to my niece getting a hold of it and not worring about her unlocking it AMD messing with it. I also love that the speaker is now on the bottom and not the back.

As time went by, I started to read about a possible new Galaxy phone. Rumors abounded. I read something about it might be holographic. Samsung had or was getting certain patents. My mind went wild. A new phone in the making! I'm one of those people who loves the latest devices. So as more info became available, all thoughts of getting the S6 Edge disappeared. I was going to wait until the S7 Edge went on sale. Then the announcement came from Barcelona that we could pre-order phones on Feb. 23rd! And I did. So...... "^5^March 24, 2016

Dandsgary77, ^916233131^1^0^"I absolutely love this phone and would recommend it to everyone. I love all the features. Camera is great. There's only one thing so far and that is the fingerprint scanner doesn't always work and I have to use my password to sign in. This isn't a huge problem though because my husband has an iPhone 6 Plus and it is the same way. I love using Samsung pay. I feel like it is so much more secure than using my card. Overall, I wouldn't trade this phone for any other phone."^5^September 20, 2016

I'm enjoying the screen that is just beautiful and easier on my eyes. I also purchased the rapid wireless charger that is great! No more plugging in the phone and having the micro port get damaged like on my old phone. The phone looks and feels great. The fingerprint scanner has come a long way, it works on the first swipe so far... I know it's day 1, but so far I'm happy with my purchase..."^5^March 11, 2016

I have used Samsung phones for about 15 years and I am continually impressed at the level of quality and use of technology. Only thing I would change is dropping the need for the Samsung apps that repeat what Google/ Android already do. It gets a bit redundant. Keep up the great work!"^5^March 31, 2016

They directed me to the Samsung S7 and so far I have been very pleased with the quality. It has an amazing camera! Some of LG's features that I had gotten used to are not the same on this phone, it will just take a matter of time before I understand how the same functions work on this phone.

The performance on this phone is amazing! I really love that they decided to bring back the expandable SD slot and water resistant features. You can really notice the difference in the camera especially in low light environments. Overall I love the device and I would definitely recommend this product"^5^March 17, 2016
HD4life, ^916233131^1^0^"This is my third Galaxy phone. So far this has been my favorite. I love the size of the battery, and the water and dust resistance. The dual edge screen is great. I love how you can customize the panels of apps and tasks that you use most often as well as other information you would like to see . The phone is fast due to the 4 GB of RAM, and the ability to expand your memory to 256 MB to handle an enormous amount of downloads is great. I highly recommend this phone."^5^September 16, 2016
RayJJ, ^916233131^1^0^"I recently upgraded from the S6 to the S7, and I have to say I'm not all that impressed. Now don't get me wrong, it is a nice phone overall, but coming from the S6 there really doesnt seem to be any speed or performance increase. The battery as well, for being bigger, lasts about the same as the S6, and that is in power save mode and the always on screen shut off. The 2 added features of being waterproof and having an SD card are of no real value to me. If I were looking for a phone, I'd just get the S6 since it should surely cost less now that the S7 is out."^3^March 21, 2016

SparkSan, ^916233131^1^0^"This is the best cell phone I've ever had. I moved from a Note 4 and the screen is nearly as big, brighter, and the entire phone is much smaller and lighter. It's simply the best phone on the market today bar none. The only significant loss was the removable battery but the quick charge 2.0 portable batteries really make up for it. I only wish it was cheaper."^5^September 3, 2016
Attica, ^916233131^1^0^"I finally upgraded from my dumbphone (please don't laugh), and decided upon the Samsung Galaxy S7.

Sweetmercy, ^916233131^1^0^"Was past time for an upgrade and I'm a Samsung loyalist. Still discovering features and operation of the S7 Edge. Had the GS 5 as my last phone and have used the other popular brand, but prefer Samsung. Converted friends over to these products when illustrating major differences and ease of use. Will buy the S-View case for the GS 7, since I found it convenient and useful for my 5. Original cases are too slick to securely hold."^4^December 25, 2016

Blackdevil, ^916233131^1^0^"I got this removed because it had a competors name on the review. Ill try not to invlove the 'competitors' name on it. Well I've had every single phone from the 'competitor' we all know who it is. Ive had the first one including the the original to recent one even the inbetweens. The S7 Edge is my first Android device that I love and find easy to use. I had the 'double tap to unlock phone' but I would barely use it due to me wanting to stick to the 'competitor'. If i had the choice between the 'competitor' or samsung I'd choose samsung anytime. I really wish I would have started with a Galaxy. It been about a month now and I haven't even touched the 'competitors' phone. I'm hoping to get the S8 when it comes out as well. The reasons for this is that that the S7 has better customization which sold me from the start. It's software is a bit more complicated but due to not really knowing the settings and geuestures of the phone. I mean from being so used to the 'competitors' phone since they're barley alike even when making a call or messaging. I also love the curved edge even though from the start I'd hit the sides a lot. Another great thing about it is the water resistant/proof since I go swimming a lot in summer. Side to side the 'competitor' and S7 are comparable being used for their own purpose but the shortcuts and animations on the S7 makes it faster and easier to use even though from the start it didn't feel like it was. I'm glad I did the change and I hope samsung keep on pulling out great devices like the S7 Edge. I can't wait to see what samsung pulls out of their sleeves next."^5^June 15, 2016

Colleen33719, ^916233131^1^0^"The phone seemed great until I realized how poor the screen durability is. I placed an Otterbox on my phone and even that could not protect the weak screen. I dropped my phone about 3 feet and a long crack appeared on the screen. I was very disappointed because my previous phone, a Samsung Galaxy S5 had survived worse drops than that without getting a single scratch on it. Later that day I check my phone and that single crack had rapidly expanded. A single crack expanded to the point my entire screen looked shattered. Worse phone I have ever had."^1^September 7, 2016
TDowns, ^916233131^1^0^"I have been an iPhone user for the past 7 years and wanted to try something different, I have always been a fan of Samsung products so why not give their phone a try. I purchased my Samsung s7 and love it already, I only wish Samsung had a 'Imessage' like feature as it was one of the things I loved most about my IPhone. But the camera and Waterproofing and different customization settings on the Samsung make up for the lack of Message capabilities. Keep up the good work."^5^October 3, 2016

Cstina2010, ^916233131^1^0^"I have owned various Samsung phones over the years, this is THE WORST product ever offered. You can not hold the phone without touching all the side nonsense. You are unable to text without one of the side items opening and taking you somewhere else all together. I turned off the side capabilities and the keyboard still isn't right. I'm not sure if it's a different set up than the Note or if it's a sensing issue but it's terrible. Also, the battery does NOT stay charged more than an hour and a half. I am not sure why but I assume it has something to do with all the side things but it ate thru my alloted data unimaginably fast.

My kid moved my bag and it slipped out onto the linoleum floor which is only about 18 inches from the ground. Despite it having an Otterbox the screen automatically cracked. Come to find other reviews this is a problem. If you're going to design a phone it should last more than one slip. I'm a Samsung fan and have 4 samsung devices and by far I'm most let down by this phone off the bat. I hope it doesn't have any other issues."^3^May 23, 2016
JLutie, ^916233131^1^0^"I love this phone. Samsung really seems like they listened and added a lot of features back that i loved on the s5. My only gripes with the design are 1. The screen is curved so there are very few tempered glass options. 2. Would have liked the camera and touch pad to be made of gorilla glass because the camera cracked and the home button is very scratched. 3. While touch wiz is lighter on this phone, I still dont like seeing it and beijg forced to use some of samsungs apps. Overall great phone."^5^September 7, 2016

Terrible quality probably the last Samsung device I buy."^2^November 5, 2016
Padre2, ^916233131^1^0^"The S7 Edge has many good features, but is severely lacking in the area I 'traded up' for. My S3 was dropping calls occasionally. Now I can't hold a signal in my small town unless the S7 is cradled in my Sleek 4 signal booster. I look forward to the day when Samsung and all phone makers produce a phone that first and foremost makes and holds a signal for a complete call and offers all of the other great working bells and whistles as a bonus."^2^July 22, 2016

s00nerchic, ^916233131^1^0^"The phone itself has a quick processor and is easy to manage. The screen however is super delicate and even in a Speck phone case, it cannot withstand even the smallest drop. My screen shattered with a case on it from a 2 foot drop because it doesn't protect the actual edge of the phone. AT&T said they do not make cases that will protect the edge of the screen.

Lasted through my 5 hr. drive, even using Google Maps for the last hour over mountain roads, and still had enough juice to finish out the afternoon of conference sessions with battery to spare. AND the fast charger is exactly that--blazing fast! Can't wait to try it out on the new Samsung stand fast charger, ordered! The screen is extremely beautiful, and i LOVE the Edge panels. Not much of a gamer, but it is handling whatever I throw at it quickly. Camera auto-focus is certainly amazing! Now can't wait to order my S-view cover!!

I am glad that I did the display on the Galaxy s7 Edge is the best I've seen on any handset and I checked out many while shopping for a new phone. The camera is also exceptional and the operating system is really quick. One piece of advice since there aren't many choices out there yet for protective cases is be very careful to not drop the phone because by the edge screen design it can shatter easily so be sure and be careful and buy a good case to protect the phone because both the front and rear are made of gorilla glass. I've never had a screen Crack on any phone that I've owned but managed to shatter the screen on my s7 edge within one month of owning it. Thank God I had taken the insurance on the phone.

This thing however, can't be killed in an entire day. I'm super heavy on the usage. Always maxing out on browsing Facebook and messenger. Browsing forums on reddit. And playing some neat little games I found on Google play. Every day I average about 7 to 7.5 hours of Screen on Time and thats just the battery! The rest of the phone is amazing as well. The performance is spot on and the user experience is fluid and easy. Not to mention how the phone physically looks and feels. This thing is beautiful. I have to put mine in a case cause I'm clumsy but this phone is one I have a hard time putting a case on. It's so pretty looking and the silver is just flashy.

The case is very slippery, so I was in the market for a protective covering or something to improve the grip. I wasn't quick enough.

chester40391, ^916233131^1^0^"I previously owned the S3 and then the Note3 before moving to S7 edge. I have no issues with it. It is only a bit smaller than the note3 which was a tad wide to put into some back pockets anyway for transport. The curved screen is very attractive and I found that I appreciate the visual affect it has when scrolling different screens. It feels more natural and realistic to see the the next screen coming around from the side like a physical carousel. The resources given to the UI likely help with this. I have yet to play with the edge menu. Ive popped it out on accident a few times but once I learned its placement it doesn't happen anymore. "^5^June 2, 2016

Mostly everything about it is great except for 2 things: The lack of software updates and the design. I haven't gotten a software update since November 18 , 2016, that was a year ago!! Also the design, It is pretty in almost every way except for the way it scratches. It cracked when i put it down on a table it cracked 2 times and scratches like crazy. Also, the speaker is really tinny and easy to muffle. But overall, It is still one of my favorite phones."^4^February 2, 2017

It stopped vibrating, and the home button rarely works. It's never been dropped or damaged in any way. Has had a screen protector and reliable case on it since I bought it.

Of course I cannot complain about the water proofing, the exquisite camera quality for both front and rear cameras.

As soon as I started setting it up I was having problems with the touch screen not responding, I thought maybe  my hand were cold or it was just taking time because it was loading. Then after I got it set it I would have to touch the screen several times or turn the screen off and on or reset the phone over and over to get it to respond. I contacted alpha electronics which is who sells it through walmart and they told me I had to contact apple for help. Apple told me I had to bring it in to an Apple Store and I would have to pay for it to be fixed, the closest one to me is over 2 hrs away! Well after using my phone for a couple days it got worse, it would zoom in on the screen and I would have to reset it and when I touch one partmof the screen another part responds!

The product had some significant scratching to the screen which I wasn't worried about because this product is used I expected it to have some use. Along with the scratches the product was dirty. There was some stickyness on the back of the phone along with some specs that were easily wiped off. I was a little annoyed by that considering this product wasn't cheap and the seller couldn't have taken an extra minute to wipe it off? Along with it just being gross it was also lazy. The only reason I returned this product was it DID NOT WORK. It wouldn't turn on. I charged it for a few days and nothing I talked to Apple Support and they said this product was broken and I should purchase a new one. This product was supposedly was refurbished but how could they have refurbished it if it doesn't work. I tried to email the seller telling them all this and they just emailed me a return slip.

Battery life is not bad, charging every other day or every third day is sufficient.  The camera makes excellent pictures.  Have 32GB memory built in with 3GB of system RAM is icing on the cake.

Patricia, ^51255172^66^15^"I bought this phone specifically for it's location tracking feature.  My mother is in the very early stages of Alzheimer's, and I need to be able to know where she is.    I found out after I bought the phone that the least expensive monthly plan that included the location tracking was $34.99/mo.  (There was a slightly lower monthly fee that included it, but it had very little talk time included in that plan.)

The tracking feature just doesn't work well.  It would wait 30-40 minutes to notify me when she left home, and when I would request a location update on the app  the little wheel just spins and it takes forever, if it works at all.  Several times it said 'unable to locate'.  Once it said that her battery was too low to update her location.  We were testing it at that time, and had her phone with us.  Her battery was at 70%.

We gave up on this phone, bought a cheap smart phone, and added the Life 360 tracking app to it.  That app works great!"^1^April 5, 2017

WalmartCustomer, ^51255172^48^6^"I got this as a backup, and to test its potential for older parents.
Great Call gave me a re-purposed number. I've been getting pharmacy texts and appointment reminders for the previous owner since the first day. But that is more of an issue for the previous owner. 
The one time I had to use the phone in a hurry (because my regular phone was not nearby) the keys stuck and I found that, in trying to make the phone intuitive, it was exactly the opposite. Everything is an arrow scroll and a YES or NO.  
The nail in the coffin is my experience with Great Call's customer service. They emailed a lengthy survey which I thought asked a lot of intrusive personal questions that could be used to target the elderly, the same customer base they want to assist. And my experience with customer support (via a phone call) was awful.
Unfortunately, the whole shebang didn't live up to its potential."^1^September 21, 2017
Tiffany, ^51255172^47^10^"I purchased a plan thru GreatCall for my Father 2 years ago.  The main reason is because of the 5-Star.  All he has to do is press the 5-Star red button for emergency help.  He loves the large numbers, the high volume and the easy to use large keypad.  
This was his first phone and he loves it and I do too.  I now feel comfortable knowing that he can get help anytime he needs it.
I had to purchase him a new phone since he broke his and I did not purchase the insurance.  The GC representative told me that I could purchase a new phone at any store.  He also stated that Walmart currently had theirs on sale.

- First, if you just casually set the flip phone into the cradle, the odds are that the contacts won't be properly aligned and the phone won't be connected to the battery charger circuit. The phone must be slightly leaning backwards to seat properly, if it's leaning too far back or if you set it into the cradle vertically, the contacts don't align. We even tried to shim the dock opening with no success.  A good design would ensure that the contacts connect reliably to the cellphone every time one is docked.
- Second,  you don't get a reliable connection between the cable and the micro USB jack in the back. I accidentally wiggled it and discovered the cable wasn't making a good connection, despite being plugged in completely. I even went to the trouble of applying hot-glue around the micro-USB plug to securely attach it to the cradle. Even with the hot glue, wiggling or bending the cable STILL caused the connection to occasionally fail. The problem is clearly the charger base jacks, not the cables.
- For blind and low-vision users, there should be no plugs or loose cables. Using a USB cable is cheap and downright mean,  and it endangers these users. The wall power module should have a long, permanent cable and the connection to the charging cradle should also be permanent or have a mechanical lock requiring a deliberate effort to unplug the cable from the base. The plug should obviously be USB-C which is reversible, not the older mini-USB, or the mechanical lock should clearly allow the cable to only be inserted into the charging base with the proper orientation. It's far too easy to unplug the standard cable and I've already commented on how unreliable the cable-jack connection is on the back of the charging cradle.
- It should be possible under 'Settings' to disable the volume control buttons to prevent a user from accidentally turning the ringer down or completely off (vibrate only).  Time after time I have found our cellphone with the ringer volume off, and of course Mom didn't hear any calls. I ended up using a Dremel tool to grind down the Volume Down button, it now takes a pointed object to deliberately press it, no more 'accidents'.
- You should be able to clear the Call History and more information should be displayed under 'Phone Info'
- I just realized that it's not possible to take photos, instead of a standard camera feature the Magnify feature has potential but the image clarity and focus are terrible."^4^August 5, 2017

Margos, ^54188796^43^4^"The manufacturer's number on the Walmart website indicated it was the unlocked version sold by Apple.  I decided to take a chance since I could return it promptly if not as described.  I needed an unlocked or locked to T-Mobile phone.

I had the phone shipped to a local store and opened the box with the clerk present.  Phone was in an original Apple box and shrink wrapped.  It was as new, including all accessories--no signs of usage.   The only way to tell it wasn't brand new was the plastic screen protector had bubbles under it.  

I popped my T-Mobile SIM card in, happily went to set up, and was disappointed--phone clearly not recognizing the SIM card.  I called T-Mobile--they said they thought the phone was locked to Family Mobile--I call them, and they said they'd happily unlock the phone after several months of service.  Not an option, think he phone's going back....disappointed....

I decide to research the phone on the Apple website--no info about carrier lock, but 
learn it has Apple warranty through September 2017.  I decided to call the local Apple Store, while on hold, I decide to plug the IMEI number into the major carrier's online activation checks.  I hit paydirt first try as AT&T said it could be activated!  I immediately went to their unlock page and learned I simply had to fill out a request form to have the phone unlocked.  About that time Apple answered the phone and confirmed it was an AT&T phone, and that I likely just had to request the unlock.  I immediately did so, received a confirmation email saying it could be up to 2 days for processing.  I went to log in to my iTunes account to see if there was anything else I could do to speed process, and an email popped up saying my phone was unlocked--5 mins to process request--was I happy!  

I restarted the phone with my T-Mobile SIM installed, and immediately had T-Mobile service!!!!  

So, yes, I'd recommend taking the chance.  If by chance the Apple warranty wasn't good, there is a 60 day warranty offered by the refurbishing company.  This was indicated by a business card placed in the shipping box--almost missed it, so look for it.

I hope this review is  of help to other shoppers."^5^April 12, 2017

Went to att store for help with SIM card, transferring data, etc...but phone would not load or get past the initial setup.  Employee said Apple was having a service issue and other customers were having difficulty getting their new phones configured (up to hour wait).
It has been 24 hrs, was able to set pass code, Siri recognition, and load wifi code, saw a quick glimpse of the home screen and phone reverts back to ' activatin required'.
I now need to enter pass code but the same cycle begins over and over and over, enter pass code, 'get started' screen, glimpse of home screen and back to 'activation required'

C2011, ^123752690^1^0^"... Over these last several years, I've probably been through around 20 smartphones, from several different manufacturers such as (Alcatel, Motorola, IPhone, ZTE, Huawei, Honor, LG, Blu, etc.). All different models and each has their pros and cons. Most of the ones I've purchased have been low to mid range phones with the exception of the Huawei Mate 9 (what an excellent phone). A couple of years ago, the 2015 Idol 3 was my favorite until I got the Honor 6x (which I still use for work) and then came the Mate 9 that I mainly use for casual time (I switched between the two). 
... Now back to 'my review or opinion' of this phone. The Moto G6 Forge was meant to be a replacement phone for my Dad's ZTE Blade X. The Blade X is a good all around phone but just like some other ZTE models, sometimes the sound goes in and out (mainly his alarm clock, still vibrates and maybe I can find a solution to the lack of sound). The pros for him were a big screen with big icons. While shopping around and really looking hard at this phone (The G6 Forge), I thought it would be a good replacement with a little slimmer design. With that said, the icons are smaller, even the largest font size isn't very big. No stock music player (get an app or use google play music). No stock photo gallery (get an app or use google photos). Even though it's Moto's budget phone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 427 processor, a Quad-core 1.4GHz processor, 2GB of ram, 16 gb of memory and a Android 8.0 Oreo OS, it still feels slow and sluggish compared to other phones from other manufacturers that I purchased, in the past few years, with similar specs. The camera does provide some options including face beauty and slow motion video. The overall pics are ok but good lighting does help. I did download a lock screen app because I would rather touch the screen vs. the side button to put to sleep. Overall, I guess it's ok? I just expected a little more. Good Luck!"^3^November 26, 2018

Fred, ^43241909^50^6^"I was initially skeptical of choosing a refurbished phone, but after reading the reviews of multiple buyers who purchased refurbished iPhones from this website, I decided to take a chance.

The phone arrived in a sealed box with all the original accessories. There was a small card which identified The Recon Group as the company who refurbished my handset. Everything works perfectly at this time, and the only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because there is a small scratch on the lower right corner underneath the screen. It does not bother me too much, nor does it affect my daily use. All the water damage indicators look intact, and the phone still has nearly 10 months of its original manufacturer's warranty remaining (which is obviously dependent on when the original owner purchased and began using the device). I also ran the serial number through Apple's database which showed that this phone was not reported lost or stolen.

Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. Buying refurbished has saved me approximately $250 over the brand new retail price."^4^May 31, 2015
Teresa, ^43241909^39^1^"This phone is NOT sold by Walmart it is a 3rd party vendor therefore if you have an issue with it you have to mail the phone back to the company, then wait for them to send you another phone. Durning this time you have no phone and you lose all of your information on the phone as it has to be wiped clean before returning it to them. I wish I had know this prior to spending my money on this."^1^November 1, 2016

Comes with a new charger and earbuds/headphones. Comes with 3 month warranty from walmart. I was completely satisfied with my decision. Thank you walmart"^5^February 27, 2016

In box, shrink-wrapped, perfectly packed with all the other pieces... worked perfectly. Very happy to save 42% of the cost on a phone, which in turn gave me a huge amt of flexibility re: which carrier and plan I took (easily able to join with a family members plan in my case).

Vladsky, ^42104299^50^12^"I was sceptical to buy a refurb product. But it turned out to be a great experience. It came in original box, with all the accessories. The box was sealed. Phone did not have a single scratch. Very impressed."^5^February 22, 2015
MunyaMunya, ^42104299^49^24^"I bought this phone when the price was $498, and I'm very pleased. Popped in my Straight Talk SIM card and it worked perfect! It arrived in 'as-new' condition. It just looks like everything was repackaged, although the headphones were sealed & untouched. What a great savings over new ones that are $650!

This phone definitely was a 'refurb' and not an 'open box return' though. There still might be something wrong with this phone because it gets really hot and the battery drains rapidly. No sweat! I just looked up on the Apple website and I have 11 months left of the factory warranty. I'll just swap it for another at the Apple Store!

So overall I'm happy with my purchase. I'm still giving this a 5-star rating because it's such a great value over buying a new one. Although I will likely be bringing my phone back to Apple to exchange for another, it's an easygoing process.

So i think this is a NO-BRAINER. If you need to buy a new iPhone, save $150 over a new unlocked and buy one of these Walmart refurbs"^5^March 22, 2015
Brandon, ^42104299^42^17^"I had ordered the refurbished iPhone based on the previous reviews stating high quality products and full functionality. The phone itself appears to be in good condition, no scratches and seems to function properly.

However, upon opening the package, the box the phone came in was damaged and scuffed. After removing the phone, I saw that the lightning cable and charging block that came with it were damaged. Specifically, the lightning cable was twisted, dirty, and bent/crimped (like an 'L') around the actual adapter portion which plugs into the phone.

I was unable to charge the phone for several days until a friend managed to lend me their charging cable, in which i discovered the wall adapter itself had been broken. It would not charge the phone even upon using my friend's working cable.

Lastly, the phone i received was not refurbished by Apple, but rather a 3rd party company. Also, the warranty on the product (90-days) is not for Wal-Mart either, but rather directly with that 3rd party company. I have contacted them in regards to sending me a replacement lightning cable and charging block, but have yet to hear back from them.

In summary, the phone itself appears to be fine, but the lightning cable and adapter i received were damaged and non-functional. Questionable customer service in resolving the issue from the 3rd party company."^1^March 20, 2015

DC1986, ^42104299^17^12^"I was suspose to get phone on the 24th I paid extra for rush shipping . My phone came today which is the 25th. I have the silver one. My OLNY ISSUE is that when you think of 'refurbished' you think of a cell phone that has gotten sent back to the manufacturer and has been inspected and set back to the factory settings etc. Since I use to work for a cell phone company I kind of know what to expect. W hat I didn't expect was a phone that was bent on one side. My first reaction was , if I buy a case it will not fit. So I bent it back to kind of help it gain it's original shape. I didn't know this was a 'as is' product until I read the warranty in the beat up box they sent me. One other thing is that this is through a third party service that goes through Walmart so Walmart can sell for them. Good luck!! Im thinking about sending this back, I have three months"^5^February 25, 2015

Since this phone was for my corporate account, I was able to set it up very quickly using the AT&T Premier account and got the phone activated in one hour using my existing number.

James, ^42104299^6^2^"I work in Electronics in Walmart, and I've wanted an iPhone 6 for a long time. This is the best price you can get for one, and the product is virtually like new (comes in a sealed box with all accessories and no scratches or defects anywhere). You can activate it either on AT&T or Straight Talk, which is way less expensive than AT&T. I also purchased the Straight Talk nano SIM card for $6.95, inserted it in the phone, called Straight Talk, and it was activated within a few hours. The only issue I've noticed is the lightening power cable is not certified by Apple and the phone somehow knows it and reports it as such. It still charges the phone just fine."^5^May 22, 2015

The only noticeable difference was the plastic on the screen had bubbles under it. The phone has been fantastic otherwise. Activated right away and has been working great for the last 2 months. No issues at all. You cannot beat this price for an iPhone 6 compared to paying full price.

Get this phone and get the Mobile Share Plan at AT&T and you are set. No contract and no phone payments, just service.

Cosmetic quality of the phone is 5/5 any scratches on the screen cant be seen unless you really look.  the body has 0 scratches so yay. 

BUT one thing I have found is you refurbished the battery with a 6S battery and not am iPhone 6 battery.  There is about a 100Mah difference between the two with the 6s being lesser.  Not a big difference but means the phone will turn off at about 6-7% battery life.

Bhavzzz, ^42104299^2^0^"Amazing phone. Came in a white box. Cant differentiate with a new one. Scratchless. Working great with ATnT and Straight Talk sim. And amazing thing is that it has a warranty ending Feb. 2016. Isnt that awesome!! Battery life fantastic. Original charger and ear phones. Earlier i wasn't sure whether a refurbished phone will function good or not but this really made my mind change. Happy to get it. Will highly recommend to everyone.

The only thing that bothered me is that it is refurbished by a Third Party and not by Apple. However, it working great."^5^June 4, 2015

Steve, ^55237551^35^28^"Just bought this from on 8/31/2017. The phone worked well until 9/4/2017. I figured out that the speaker works very very bad...something like I listen the bad signal radio whenever I receive phone calls, listen to music, or watch videos on Youtube. 
I did come to Walmart ask for return and refund, of course. But they said (customers service guys) there was a mistake here, the item number, on the back of the box, is not the same as the item number they checked on their computer.

4dugnlee, ^955535756^3^0^"I took a chance and purchased this phone in hopes it would have wifi calling option through Verizon.  IT DOES!  I need that option because cell service at my house is not good.  The phone itself I would give 5 stars.  The listing, however, is wrong!  It is only 16GB...NOT 32GB.  I did buy this particular phone because of the listing 'stating' that it is 32GB.   I do like the phone and it is still a good price for 16 GB compared to other retailers.  If fact, I went back and bought hubby one too.  The call quality seems very good (much better than my old LG G3 on a different network).  The battery life is very good.  I can usually go 2  days before needing a charge.  My old phone wouldn't last through one full day (and yes, I did replace the battery in it with a new one).  Screen and camera seem very good and responsive.  All in all happy with the phone but I do wish it had been 32GB as stated."^4^July 3, 2018

OldNotDead, ^363923460^1^0^"I bought this really not sure from the negative reviews but have been pleasantly surprised. I've had all kinds of phones including flagship phones from most the major brands. I work in harsh environments and even with cases my phone's don't survive. So over the past year or two I've switched to budget phones costing in the $50-150 dollar range, that way if I ruin it, no big deal I can get another. Plus I can just find a Walmart and get one and pop the Sim and sd card in and I'm good to go. I went with Android for the backup capabilities of when I do have to replace a phone, I just restore a backup and I'm left with about 30 mins of tinkering with other settings and it's like nothing ever happened. Anyway, I just ruined my Moto phone, which I loved, and went to Walmart and bought a Alcatel Tetra. It was ok but screen kind of non responsive and charging was a nightmare tbh. Great size and quick enough but the charging thing I couldn't live with, so, went back and saw the Axia. I liked it was a bigger screen and the blue color so I got it. Didn't even notice it was the Android Go version until I got it home. Long story short, I set everything up over WiFi and started messing with the Android Go system and everything and it leaves my Tetra phone in the dust. Even as a power user requiring looking at huge spreadsheets and a lot of mapping programs for work and tons of business emails, I can say I really love this phone. No, it's not a $600-800 iPhone or Samsung whatever model, but I can do everything with this phone I did with them and then some....and I only spent $50!! Is it the most responsive all the time? No, but it's not terrible either. I feel sometimes the reviewers expect too much from a budget phone, plus they have probably never known a world without electronics either so they have higher expectations maybe, idk. So many phones people have loved, I found rather crappy and vice versa so it's a personal preference too. I hope they continue with Android Go development for budget Androids because this is all I'm buying now. Seriously, give the $50 phone a chance and have a little patience sometimes (omg it takes a few more seconds for something to open up!..some people say..) and it will serve you well. The ONLY problem I'm having is it's a tad bit glitchy when playing my online tank game but I've adjusted to it and can still play just fine. Thanks ATT and Android for making this platform."^5^January 7, 2019

Ali, ^176863234^53^13^"I ordered a refurbished Iphone 6 for about $250 from Quick Wireless. I received the phone but without the charger and earphone. Can anyone accept a dead phone without charger? 
The phone itself was in the worst condition. There was million scratches and dents on the phone. If it was me, I was embarrassed to even sell something like that. 
I purchased a gold color and got a silver color from this vendor. I contacted them and they wanted me to keep the phone in return of $20 discount. The phone did not worth a penny so I told them no I already purchased a new one.
I could return the phone, but they are sending me my money in partial payments; unbelievable. I have already revived 4 partial payments and every time I had to send them an e-mail that your partial payments do not add up to what I paid initially.  So stressful.

I returned it and they charged me a 20% restocking fee (almost $60).  I called to dispute the restocking fee and they told me that the unit worked when they tested it.  If you want to spend $60 to get nothing in the end, this is a great deal.  If you want a working phone, go somewhere else.

Grassbackwards, ^652723441^23^5^"There is plenty to ready or watch on Youtube about this phone, so I won't reiterate any of that.  It is true to Samsung quality, and an excellent version of the Note, that you can hold and use with one hand, which is why I made the switch.  Also, lighter weight than the Note 9, which is noticeable.  Pen keeps getting better, with better handwriting to text recognition, and new features--I do use the pen quite often for taking notes, and it works fantastic.  Screen looks great, I can't see why people are complaining about specs.  Battery seems to last all day.  I use the included earbuds, and they work well, so no complaints about lack of headphone jack.  Also, unlike other many other phones Samsung allows you to increase screen sensitivity, which helps when using a screen protector.

I don't like big phones and I find them harder to fit in my pocket or wallets/wristlets. The note 10 is perfect for me. My husband have to note 10 plus and I'm very happy that I chose the note 10. The plus would have been too big for me but love both phones. People are upset about the missing headphone jack but it doesn't bother me cause I've been using my galaxy buds. Also for the other missing features that this phone doesn't have compared to the note plus doesn't bother me but could have been cheaper. All in all a great phone and I'm happy with my purchase."^5^August 25, 2019
Neseyy, ^652723441^9^1^"I just got this today and i love it except the aura blue is not what i accepted. Also really dislike the no audio jack. I wish they would of sent a audio jack extender like apple does at lease. One of the reasons i didn't like apple was because of the no audio jack. Really wish they would stop trying to be like apple and be themselves. If they send out audio jack extenders then i would change my review."^3^August 28, 2019

My problem is the lack of headphone jack. It doesn't come with an adapter & not any simple adapter is supported. I would have gave it 5 stars had it not been for the lack of including an adapter.

Love the phone--have had no problems with it, love the fact it has 16 GB of memory and the camera is outstanding.  Was a snap to transfer info from my old to the new by using Transfer Wizard.  It was very easy to make the transition to the Pro Lte.  A few new bells and whistles, but no problem.

PandaLuv, ^421545230^22^0^"I've had this phone almost a year and since I use my phone for so much (gaming, watching videos, music,alarm clock, calender, business and more) I end up being pretty rough on them despite buying cases and screen protectors things happen. I have just now begun to have delayed text messages and screen freezing so I'm looking into getting a new phone and honestly, I'll probably buy this one again! I have only experienced the picture/text deleting problem a few times and I send and receive plenty. The internal storage is more than what most phones comes with. There's also an option to add your own up to 32gb micro SD card which I've done. I'm an avid mobile gamer and play a lot of games that use a lot of memory. I've only experienced the 'internal storage is low' message once which is yesterday because my phone no longer fully recognizes my SD card probably due to being dropped and ENTIRELY my fault. I have one dislike about this phone, it is a VERY big one in my book and is why I can't give this phone a full 5 star rating. You can't remove the battery! If the phone freezes you have to hold certain buttons which is annoying but my main problem with a battery you can't remove is that when you start have problems with the battery keeping a charge (another issue I'm experiencing) you can't simply buy a replacement one. All in all though, this phone is pretty great. I've been through a lot of phones and this one has by far been the best one."^4^April 24, 2019

Mine was manufactured in June 2018 and came with Android 7.1.2, but now Google updates the OS automatically, so mine is now running Android 8.1.0 (as of 6/25/19). The Travel Adapter that comes with it puts out 1.2A, so it will fully charge in about 150 minutes, if the phone is off. A 3 foot micro USB cable is included, so there is no need to buy an additional USB cable.

Also, Android 8.1.0 no longer has a repeat notification (i.e. every 1, 2, 5 minutes, etc.). You have to constantly keep waking the phone up and checking for messages."^5^July 24, 2019
David McC, ^421545230^2^0^"Phone is working well for me so far. I read the bad reviews and my phone doesn't have faults found by others, like too-low sound volume and keypad not coming up. Memory and storage are ample for my needs. Battery life is good; I'm not a heavy phone user, but a charge lasts me at least a week with battery saver (extended mode) and turning phone off at night. Unlike on my old phone, micro USB port on this one recognizes my 2-way flash drive (micro/regular USB), so I should never have to remove and replace the micro SD card to transfer files like on the old one. (This is good, because it's not so easy to remove and replace the card in the little tray that also holds the SIM card on this phone.)

Really??  Cmon Straight Talk!  Then I got  transferred, more putting on hold, etc. after over 1.5 hr of messing around, the ST service rep said that she was having computer problems, and I MIGHT be better off driving over to a local Walmart store.

MGT, ^271853560^1^0^"I bought this phone because I really needed to upgrade. My previous phone was a $50 Samsung that just wasn't making the cut. I decided to buy this phone because I've owned a couple of Motorola phones in the past and I really liked them. For a $100 phone, it's pretty impressive. It's faster than my old Samsung. The screen is bigger and the camera takes better photos. I haven't really experienced any problems with the phone itself being slow or freezing. It has been a rare and minor issue with my Facebook and Chrome apps though. I have gotten the 'not responding' pop up once or twice in those apps, but that's it.  My favorite thing about this phone so far, is how durable it is. This evening I sat the phone down on one of my basement steps as I was taking some bags of trash downstairs. I accidentally knocked the phone off of the edge of the step and it fell about 6 feet down and landed on a concrete floor. I was so sure that I had just killed my phone. But, when I picked it up, it didn't have a scratch on it and it worked perfectly. I've had phones that were 3 or 4 times more expensive than this one that broke after falling only 1-2 feet from the ground. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone that is looking for a more budget friendly phone."^5^May 9, 2019
bstaszak, ^271853560^1^0^"the phone isn't too bad when I first bought the phone It loaded all the apps I used with speed now I got to open snap chat or any other app it's take 30 seconds or more and it's annoying to say the least I had a lot of faith in this phone but it seems as the quality and performance is slowly dwindling looking for a new phone already so laggy as well if you can avoid this phone"^2^November 18, 2018
GnNC, ^271853560^1^0^"I really like this Motorola e5 phone. I'll start with the negatives first. It really doesn't charge fast. It takes 2 hours to charge. It really doesn't have a LED light for notifications. Which isn't good. That's why I took off a star. Now the positive side. I love the battery in this phone. I was using a Galaxy S7. It would never hold a charge all day. This phone does. It's screen is huge and show's just as good as my Galaxy S7. Which tells you all you need to know. It's just not a fancy phone. It isn't a $300 phone. But a good basic big phone. But I have only had it a week though. Also I think the camera is really good for a bargain phone. For $100 this is a steal. It has a panoramic mode"^4^November 16, 2018

Way too big for my small hands and I wish I would of gone with the smaller phone. I've had an iPhone since the first one came out. I could never switch to any other phone at this point. The iPhone convinced me that a MAC has to be a great PC and I now LOVE MY MAC. I just purchased the iPad mini 3 and I have an iPad air both 128 gb. I thought I would sell my air and keep the mini, but I'm having a really hard time parting with it. Every time I upgrade, I sell my old iPhone unlocked and it almost pays for the new phone.

eaglehasspoken, ^369999148^13^0^"The 6 inch screen is what i really like on this phone. Absolutely notch-free. I'm used to no 3.5mm jack since i use a separate device to listen to music. the battery of 3000mAH is a step up from my z2 Force with just 2700mAH, which i couldn't take anymore. And best way to conserve battery on any phone is disabling any switches like cellular/wifi/bluetooth/location/scanning) you're not using till you need it again. Oh, and I've switched over from a long time of using Windows. At least i can use the Launcher 10 app with this. :) Also moto actions like one button nav, and lift to unlock. Another tip. always keep your phone updated, especially to the latest firmware, which is 9 Pie. And for screen, I tend to keep it on standard instead of vibrant to save on battery."^5^October 14, 2019

Raecali, ^369999148^12^6^"I had a motorola phone before that lasted me a long time but it was time for a new phone so I came back to motorola to find the next one. I was excited to buy this product for the moto mods that could be attached to it. They allow you to get a cheaper phone with less features and pick the features you want such as a better camera or speaker, wireless charging or larger battery, etc. The fingerprint scanner was a nice addition to have, however the location led to me accidentally unlocking it often. Unfortunately the bonus of the moto mods are offset by being unable to fit an any protective case. The only cases that work with any phone in the moto Z line that allow use of mods are the bumper cases which wont provide much protection. If there was a hope of cases being made to support mods I would have kept the device. However since the original Z and Z2 neither have such cases, it was apparent that none would be made so I had to return the device as that is a necessity for me. If you do not use cases or drop your phone much then I would recommend this phone for you. I will be waiting for the next motorola phone and hope it has some of the features I liked in the mods included."^4^July 6, 2018
Krislaughs, ^369999148^11^4^"I bought this phone several weeks ago. The app functions and battery life are far superior to my dying droid turbo. Camera is fine, but not more impressive than older ones. My real disappointment is with its function as a phone (I may be unusual in still using my phone to make and receive calls). Speakers are really bad, calls come in uniformly soft, even at max volume, and with much worse interference than the old turbo. Speaker phone function is a little better, but I can't always use the phone on speaker or bluetooth. My second major disappointment is that Moto mods for wireless and turbo-battery are unavailable. I presume they are phasing out this line and disappointed to have purchased already obsolete technology. Returning if possible."^2^November 7, 2018

We liked the specs and the mods were interesting to us. We took a chance and we are so glad we did! The mods are great and the battery mod it came with is wonderful! We also love the Alexa speaker.

Snowuse, ^369999148^8^2^"Had it for over a month now. Should've kept my Z Play. There is an extra gig of RAM and double the internal storage. The phone itself feels like a huge downgrade. There's no headphone jack. It's ok I'll live. But why remove the fwd facing flash? There's plenty of room for it and I had one of the only phones with one. It's also way thinner. It feels too thin. And the side fingerprint reader isn't horrible. The larger screen sort of pushed it to the side. But now you can't turn off the screen for some reason. So you can unlock and turn on the screen with the fingerprint reader but can't turn the screen off. Now you need to find the power button on the other side of the phone to turn off the screen. And there's no option to fix this. I really regret buying this phone. I've had Motorola phones for years with no complaints."^2^November 30, 2018

Joe Evaristo, ^369999148^4^5^"No headphone jack, so the adapter means no charging and music at the same time. For those of us who work around audio boards and benefit from the physical jack, this is extremely obnoxious. The default notification tones were also really grating after a stressful day. The whole point of new tech is that the phone should become more user-friendly, not less. And the phone is far too thin/fragile! This is the first new phone I wasn't excited about--I wouldn't have made the purchase (and would have returned it immediately) if I wasn't forced to make buy it from running my Galaxy S5 into the ground."^2^October 25, 2018
ViaVeritas, ^369999148^4^2^"Overall the Z3 Play is a nice phone thats capable of handling whatever you throw at it quickly and efficiently. The screen is incredibly crisp and clear, the added size is definitely a benefit while browsing the internet or watching a video. I haven't played with the camera a whole lot but the pictures I have taken look great, so far no complaints. The included battery pack works great, super simple to attach, charges quickly and gives you hours of extra use. Some reviews complain about the location of the fingerprint sensor, personally I prefer it on the side of the phone. I'm able to comfortably reach it with my thumb while holding my phone with one hand. I had the G5 before this phone and it wasn't easy to quickly and confidently swipe the sensor (located bottom center) with one hand unless the phone was positioned perfectly. "^3^July 23, 2018

Another feature that I am disappointed in, is the camera. With my Droid Turbo, the pictures were amazing. I am a photographer, so I was thoroughly impressed with the shots I could get with my phone. I quit carrying my regular camera around because of this. The camera on the turbo had a 21.2 megapixel camera. The Z3 has 12 megapixels and the quality is incredibly poor. Distance shots are grainy and the dual lenses go in and out of focus. I have been a Motorola user since the Razor, but if Motorola is going to put out cheap phones from now on, I will have to research another company to buy my phones from. "^3^February 16, 2019

KARL, ^369999148^2^2^"This is my first Motorola phone purchase in over 15 years.  My last Motorola was a black and yellow flip phone with the Push-To-Talk feature, which was purchased through Sprint's Boost.  That was a terrific phone!  My new Z3 play is very responsive, feels good in the hand and I like the fingerprint unlock button.  I have no issues with it being mounted on the side of the handset, as some other critics have bemoaned.  The display is bright and crisp.  The camera is good, but not great; but for a mid-range phone that is acceptable to me.  My only concern is the update support to this new phone.  I wasn't aware that Motorola had such poor phone update support, which everyone seems to complain about and I assume must be accurate.  If that is the case with Motorola, then this may very well be my last Motorola purchase.  I will wait and see...I also own a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus phone, which is my primary phone through Sprint.

^369999148^2^0^"Like another post, I've owned Moto phones nonstop since the analog MicroTac of 1989.  They have been reliable and tough beyond when they are obsolete, today's Lenovo-Moto still seem that way.  Stock Android make phones Android One like even before the program started.  Everything works per spec sheet, but Moto phones suffers in ergonomics that differ per model, but not the durability or build quality.  For the Z3Play, the speaker volume is weak except in speaker phone, but the voice quality remains land-line like.  In a car, I can barely hear the Moto Voice or Google Voice through the phone's native speaker, compared side by side with my Droid Maxx, same with system sounds like clicks, they are fainter, but overall the pluses are more than minuses. I'm not too sure if the screen won't crack with a fall, as the phone is the biggest I've ever owned, and the case lacks the rubber like frame, its all glass back to front.  I also find the camera sticks out, while most are recessed in the case, making it also vulnerable to damage, so this is the first phone I've owned I got a slim case for, as well as a tempered glass screen protector. Call screening is so good I gave up my custom app that did that for me and the camera I use daily a lot for insurance work and is a joy to use.  AMOLED is sharper and brighter except in bright sunlight, and all my apps work quickly and so far, zero wait.  Netflix FAST reports wifi over 260 Mbps, bluetooth pairs easy and NFC is even easier to work with now.  I don't miss the headphone jack as I use bluetooth.  SD internal storage configuration is wow, my phone has a whopping 256GB of storage, and the specs say it supports to 2 TB, we'll see when those cards come available.  So what's not to like?"^5^November 21, 2019

PixsReviews, ^369999148^1^0^"So my experience with this phone has been pretty enjoyable over the 6 months that I've had this device. The camera is pretty good, but has to have some good lighting. The battery lasts a little less then a day, but the battery pack adds a lot more hours. The speaker mods are useful whenever I want good quality sound without any wires. The performance is not as good as the price would seem it is, but it is powerful enough for some light gaming. My favorite features are probably the Moto navigation bar, the shake for flashlight, and slide on one side for one handed use. Some of these features you can only get if you root your device, but it comes stock with this phone. The one downside is the slow updates, but all the other features kinda make that a non issue. It still gets updates, but not as fast as other devices. If it got faster updates, then I would probably rate it a five star.

rosa, ^369999148^1^0^"This phone was all great and well for the month I had it. It performed smoothly and how I wanted it to. However, it's not built well. I expect a phone to still work after falling from waist height onto the ground, but after my phone fell with its otterbox and screen protector, the screen went wonky and then pretty much black. This is the only time I dropped it. Perhaps I should have bought the extra protection plan, but, still, I expect a phone to survive such a minor fall with the extra protection I provided it. I would only recommend this phone if you are someone who never drops anything."^1^October 11, 2019

I'm a die hard Motorola fan, but I can't give it a 5th star due to 1) I prefer to have a separate Jack for earbuds and 2) Even with the battery mod I just barely get 24 hours and that is not using it much. Yes I had higher expectations."^4^September 12, 2018

Ecurb59, ^369999148^0^1^"The technology of this phone is great! Maybe too much technology, for example; it will call contacts on it's own ( even when it's locked ). It will also send random text messages to contacts. Sometimes it will be trying to download apps on it's own. At times when it activate it, websites will be on your screen, some of which never seen before.

JoeI, ^369999148^0^1^"I've purchased 2 Z3 Play's, a 64 gb and a 32 gb, both have the same problem. Since updating to Android 9 both have power button issues. When I press the power button to lock the phone it often reads it as a double press and tries to turn on Google assistant, or it will react slowly to the button press, meaning I press it and it takes a couple of seconds for the screen to actually go off and to lock. If I don't wait for the screen to go off and accidentally press an app when putting it in my pocket then it will stay awake. Pretty sure this can be fixed with an update because it only happened after an update. Before Android 9 the power button worked like a normal power button, now it's so annoying I switched back to my Z2 Play."^2^October 25, 2019

Battery dies at 40% sometimes, phone is constantly freezing and constantly bugging, I don't think there's been a single time I've opened my phone and not had it freeze when in use. Camera is absolutely terrible, when filming video and moving the camera it stutters like you would not believe and apps are constantly crashing and not responding.

Thats where my biggest problem is, it shuts off about every 10 minutes give or take if it isn't connected to a power cord. Battery life is a joke and the indicator on the screen is always wrong because I'll plug it in at 12% and it'll immediately jump to 45%. I'm going to call them and see if I can get it replaced as I bought the 2year warranty with it."^1^November 28, 2017

The iPhone convinced me that a MAC has to be a great PC and I now LOVE MY MAC. I just purchased the iPad mini 3 and I have an iPad air both 128 gb. I thought I would sell my air and keep the mini, but I'm having a really hard time parting with it. Every time I upgrade, I sell my old iPhone unlocked and it almost pays for the new phone.

He never even put an unlock code on it. He's only 13 years old. I won't let him. I went so far as to spend a whole day on the phone with Apple to restore the phone so I wouldn't have to send it back but it would never restore. It would do anything.

The worker plugged it up and the charger fit loose, I could have dealt with that but when she put in my sim card the phone wouldn't read it.  So the worker put in her sim card (she had an iphone as well) and it wouldn't read that one either.  How are we supposed to use a phone that barely charges and won't read sim cards? I sent the phone back the same day I received it.  I received my refund for only 159.99 when I paid 199.99 so I sent Quick Wireless an email and they explained that there is a process fee or some stuff like that.  Told me they tested the phone upon arrival and there is nothing wrong with it.  Ok,  if there was nothing wrong why would i send it back,  not to mention I had to pay to ship it back to them as well. This is aweful  they send faulty phones and charge you when you send them back.

Only thing that disappointed her and myself is that is says 5.7 inch so we ordered stuff for that size and had to send it all back because they were too big for it so its not 5.7 so please remember that if you order this phone so you're not in a predicament like us.

This runs Android 8.1 and is CDMA compatible and on the Verizon network (I live in the country and this is vital to my having reception).  It doesn't have a notification LED light that blinks, but it does have Moto Display which will show the time and any notifications discreetly when the phone is sleeping and you pick it up.  I highly recommend this phone.  It has the same quality as the original Moto E and Moto E2 but with a lot more bells and whistles.

bich, ^53753317^68^9^"I revived a broken iPhone, plain and simple. Though at first glance the phone seems in perfect shape aside from a few scratches on the back (i was aware of the refurbishment). As i tried to use casual functions of the iPhone (cellular data, listening to music, ect. ) i come to realize that there are quite a few problems with the phone. I was paying for cellular and my phone would not allow me to access the feature. This means casual smart phone utilities (maps, imessage, and face time) did not work. As i tried to contact the company i come to realize that they make it difficult. Myself and several Walmart corp. crew members tried several times to call the number that they provide to Walmart in case of issues and it was just a crudely recorded message of which you cannot understand.  Although they did reply to my Emil in one business day, they were asking me to return it FOR REPAIR opposed to a new phone.

Simple, standby battery good, reception great. Walmart has the lowest price on this phone. Buy it if you want a simple phone. Recommend"^5^April 18, 2016
Victor, ^44618321^27^5^"First off, I downgraded from a Droid Turbo to this phone, because I felt like my smartphone had taken over my life. Anyways, I got this because it was $10 and it worked with Family Mobile, Walmart's cell service. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. Thought I could get this until I found something better. But, I am blown away by the amount of features this phone offers for only $10. Aside from not having a QWERTY keyboard, this phone has everything else I need. I don't want access to the internet or apps on my phone anymore, but I would still like to have access if I really need it. This phone has a browser that displays pages just like a laptop or smartphone, except that the page is ultra magnified to make up for the low resolution. Otherwise, I was able to check if I had any new Yahoo Mail messages and was able to do a Google search. I'm really surprised to find out it has Bluetooth. I'm even more surprised to find out it has a micro SD slot up to 32 GB's. Looking forward to using it as an mp3 player. Probably the most amazing thing, for a $10 phone, is that it has speech recognition. Haven't tried it yet, cuz I never really liked that feature on my Droid Turbo. But, I'm kinda shocked that a $10 phone can have all these higher end features. The battery is pretty decent and charges up really fast. So, who really cares that it doesn't last 20 hours. It doesn't take hours, like my Droid Turbo(the battery was old).  Lastly, it updates the time and date automatically and has all the basic features that other dumb phones have, like assigned keys, alarm, stopwatch/timer, calculator, world clock, calendar, and even voice memo. If you need more than that, you should really buy a smartphone. What this phone offers far exceeds what you should get for $10.  I'm very happy with it."^5^August 6, 2016
Bobbie, ^44618321^26^5^"I took this phone to T-Mobile and they set me up with minutes. This is working just great! I also was able to set up the Bluetooth in my car so I can receive calls when I'm driving without having to access my phone. Wonderful safety feature.

Since I never had a problem with them, I opted to go with their yearly paid plan. Well 5 months into that plan, I no longer get service in the vicinity of my house, my calls drop in and out. I get service everywhere other than in my local vicinity. They insist it is my phone and I need to replace my phone. It is not my phone. My phone works perfectly fine; it is the connection in the lines. Straight Talk refuses to work with me, nor will they refund me the 180 days I have left on this yearly plan. My phone is useless. They got close to 600 dollars of my money but they refuse me customer service. We have talked to 3-4 of their customer service agents/managers and they have been nothing but nasty.

They will however replace it for about the price you could purchase a new one when they go on sale. I'm frustrated because Apple should be able to produce a quality product that you can wear every day without a bulky protective case. The retail price for the watch is $400.

I have had 4 or 5 different Android phones in the past and was always happy with how they worked.  But this phone far exceeds all my expectations for a $80 prepaid phone.  I was lucky to get the last one off the shelf at my local Walmart.  The set up was super easy and I was and am still amazed at how fast this phone is.  It is very responsive and works flawlessly with all the software I have installed on it.   The colors are very sharp and clear and the screen resolution is superb.   I originally bought this to be a 'fill-in' phone until the new microsoft phones come out, but as great as this has been I don't even feel the need to look elsewhere.  If anything I may be looking to get a high end Motorola phone cause if this phone is any indication of how well this company makes phone I can only imagine the high end ones are even better.  Great phone for the price and does EVERYTHING (and more) that it advertises.  <-- One happy Moto owner."^5^December 3, 2016

Shelley, ^53970798^22^30^"I do like this phone but Verizon will not allow you to access data during phone calls. When the data is on and your not on a call, your connection is 4G LTE. But when you get a call, the connection switches to a 1X connection and disconnects your data. My car relies on a always on data connection for my safety and Verizon restricting this is unacceptable. The actual sim that comes with this phone isn't even an authentic 4G LTE sim. I am really disappointed in Verizon.  From forums I have read I came to understand that post paid accounts are allowed the always on data connection but prepaid isn't. This is also a negative mark in my book. So don't waste your money if you are looking for a modern prepaid device. This one is from the caveman cell phone era."^1^February 28, 2017

This company has been caught on occasion adding spyware to their products.  Most notably PC's ('Superfish') but also the possibility ('ADUPS') software for ANDROID.  In all fairness they are not alone, however they have been listed on sites that I have read.  Whether or not Motorola or Verizon monitor this I don't know.  There are remedies.

Hamunaptrah, ^53970798^14^20^"The Verizon Moto G4 Play is a bit of a throwback with its thick metal band sides and deceptive size that in the end contain a small 5 inch screen.
The Marshmallow operating system is what really saves the day with a lot of added and time saving features over Lollipop.
Durability is only fair as the old style wrap around frame is subject to denting and therefore cracking the screen which is made of gen 3 Gorilla glass.
Non slippy back is a good feature but in the end you will likely want to get rubberized impact protection.
Annoying features are its oversized for its small screen, the screen is for some reason a dust magnet while battery live is poor and charge time even when completely turned off....it recharges VERY slow.
Where it shines it phone sound quality and the ability to work well even with just one bar signal strength.
Also it has a very good camera which is a plus but somewhat odd considering.
Online performance is good IF you avoid the Opera browsers which really put a drag on internet performance, best browser for data saving and speed is the UC browser.
Overall for what it is it is a $29.00 phone at best so it is all about how bad you want it and wether or not you are using rose colored glasses.

This phone reluctantly replaces my favorite LG Premier because Verizon doesn't support it, but moving to the Moto from the Premier is like going from a BMW to a Fiat."^3^April 8, 2017

HamRadioGeek, ^53970798^10^0^"I don't know who is subsidizing this phone, but this phone is a steal. You are getting a frustration free experience for less than the fraction of price of a decent tablet with the same specs.

I've had it for only a few hours and here are the few things it lacks and what I love about it.

It lacks an LED indicator to let you know if it is charging/charged/message. This means I have to turn my screen on to see if my phone is fully charged or if I have a message waiting.

It lacks an internal compass.

I can't figure out how to get my battery% value next to the clock... I guess Moto turned off this Android feature.

That's it...?



What I love about it...

16GB storage Ram and 2GB working RAM! I haven't experienced any lag. 2GB working RAM is a must have these days.

Built in FM radio. Maybe it's listed somewhere in the specs, but I missed this feature that belongs in every phone. No more tearing up my data plan just to enjoy some local radio.

This phone came with a huge battery that I haven't seen since a much larger phone. This battery takes up almost 2/3rds of the phone. I haven't tested longevity yet.

Colorful options for the back! What?! I opened the box and these fell out as I was opening it up from the back. The other two colors are blue and lavender/purple.

The camera in my less than ideal living room lighting late at night is very responsive on the main 8M side. It has true HDR capabilities. What's not to love with true HD? 

For the selfies... the chat camera is equally responsive in bright light, and smart enough to use the screen as an off white flash to provide a good photo in poor lighting when the room is too dark for a good photo. This was the only time the camera delayed.

Adaptive brightness... not all cheap phones have this feature. This one does. When it's dark, the screen dims so you aren't staring at a harshly bright screen.

Emergency Alerts. The last couple phones I've had lacked this feature and I missed it. Glad to see this available. We'll see how well this is implemented since my last network was not Verizon and I can't remember the last time I got an emergency alert.

Like I said before. I can't believe I paid less than $50 for these specs!

Here's a heads up... you do need to do firmware updates for security purposes. If the phone doesn't prompt you, you can do it yourself from Settings - About Phone - System Updates. At the time of this review 7/31/17) there were three separate updates. The third update required access to WiFi. Allocate about 10-15 minutes for each update. 

Firmware updates are not a bad thing. It's actually reassuring to see that Motorola is maintaining an up to date firmware for this phone."^5^July 31, 2017

AbecRide, ^53970798^5^2^"It has good storage (16GB) and a pretty decent camera for a $50 phone. So it does the job.  I switched from an LG Transpyre to this.

^570937541^66^8^"I have the z3 and it's a wonderful phone, but the z4 is spectacular. Love the absence of bloatware with the android one experience. Android 9.0 is superb. Phone has a moto application with some really great features that supplement the Android Pie experience.. Simply genius. Moto/Lenovo has created something very special with this phone and the continuity with the moto mod capability is just supreme. I have 2 entry level battery mods and the 360 camera that came in box with this phone. I definitely will be picking up the projector mod and speaker mod maybe even the polaroid mod. I really have no need for the camera mod, but it is tempting because of the zooming feature. I can't say enough about the value for the price of this phone. It literally makes this phone one of the best phones on the market. Keep in mind I'm coming from Samsung galaxy then Essential and now Moto and never looking back."^5^August 19, 2019
audrabmoto, ^570937541^55^11^"I had the Moto z2 before purchasing the z4. My husband has the z3 and is very happy. This is my 3rd Moto phone and I've been really happy since we've been purchasing these. EXCEPT the fingerprint scanner on this device is literally terrible! I've read through forums, etc.. and tried so many things to make this better. It's such a pain that I wouldn't recommend this phone. It makes me miss my z2. I like everything else about this phone. My husband really likes the scanner on the side of the z3 and hasn't had any issue with it. I wish I would have went with the z3 until Moto has fixed the z4's scanner. I have a feeling it's not as easy as an update fix. I hope to not see this on the screen again."^3^September 12, 2019
Ricoshijin, ^570937541^45^8^"I have had this for 2 weeks now and I love it. I have used the S10 and the Pixel 3a and both are good phones but the z4 is just something else. Good build and quality for the price but what makes it stand out is the mods. Really worth the value."^5^August 16, 2019

I would give this phone 5 stars however I miss having the fingerprint scanner, it worked so much better.  This one has it integrated into the screen and only works 1 out of 10 times.  I was also let down because it didn't include the 360 camera mod as advertised here.  The rear camera is amazing!  Much improved over old phone's camera.  It is the best quality pictures with great resolution!  I do recommend this phone to anyone just make sure they have included what they advertise."^4^October 30, 2019
Aspirational0843, ^570937541^27^2^"I have to say I have stuck with Motorola phones since the Nextel days. I like this phone a lot but the fingerprint sensor us faulty. I think embedding the sensor was a flaw in its design. Hopefully there will be an update or something in the future to fix this issue.

LordParadox, ^570937541^24^2^"Just got the phone a couple days ago, they really trimmed out all the unnecessary apps. It's super responsive, the 360 camera is a fun mod, I have only one complaint, the mods/protectors aren't available for purchase at standard stores, it's all online >_<. Third party cases are also hard to find. They should add a wallet folio case with their phones along with whatever mod comes with the phone, but that's just this consumer's opinion."^4^September 28, 2019
Libby, ^570937541^23^7^"This is my fourth Moto Z family phone. I've loved all of the other ones I've had, but this one is by far the worst. The battery doesn't make it through the day, and it works very poorly if not on wifi - an issue I never had with my z3. It freezes often. Other reviewers mentioned the optic fingerprint sensor thing working badly, which is true but not a big deal for me - I just use the pattern unlock. I really regret buying this phone, I wish I had just replaced my z3 with another of the same. Might switch to Samsung."^2^September 4, 2019

Cat84, ^570937541^15^4^"I bought this about 6 weeks ago and I have been disappointed since day one.  I had the Z 2 play before this and loved that phone.  I upgraded because of the stated exceptional battery life.  Well my old phone  battery lasts twice as long as this one and my Z2 was 2 years old.  The finger print sensor is terrible and so is the reception on phone calls. I have never had this much problem hearing people and calls cutting out with any phone ever.    Also my phone will just randomly switch to landscape mode even if my phone hasn't moved and I can't get it to go back to portrait mode unless I toggle the auto mode swith several times.  It is so frustrating!  The screen is really fragile too.  I was bending down to help my daughter tie her shoe and the phone slipped out of my hand from maybe 12' from the ground and the screen broke right away.  My Z2 play was a way better phone and the screen must have been unbelievably strong since it never broke even after if had fallen from much higher spots and without a case. I wouldn't recommend this phone."^1^September 9, 2019
C Kar, ^570937541^9^2^"I got this phone recently to replace my LG Vista 880 from 2014 which I loved. It has been a great phone so far, pretty intuitive, just a bit of a learning curve to adjust from my previous extremely user-friendly phone.  It is longer and slimmer than my old phone which I'm still adjusting to and not sure if I'm as happy as I thought I would be with the shape. I LOVE that it comes with so much storage...my old phone only had 8 gb! And it has many great features. Essentially a Samsung Galaxy without the price. Great job, Moto!! Little difficult to find accessories like case and screen protector other than online. The fingerprint feature is an absolute disaster...in about 100 swipes, it opened 3x by total accident when I was just frustrated and swiping quickly to get straight to the pin opening. I've since changed to only pin opening.  My spouse and sons having been purchasing Moto for their most recent phones for several years now and have been very happy.  Overall, I really like this phone so far."^4^August 22, 2019

Robert H, ^570937541^6^1^"I just got my phone yesterday.  I have been a long-time motorola customer and have a great deal of brand-loyalty.  That doesn't mean I can't be honest.  Let's start with initial impressions: Looks: Straight out of the box (White) the back of the phone looks incomplete.  The camera sticks out and the pinset for the mods looks ugly.  That being said, I spend very little time staring at the back of the phone.  The Front Side: The screen is beautiful.  Great color on start-up.  Set-up was a breeze with Verizon and Google.  I was impressed.  Holding the phone, however, is another proposition.  It's smooth to the point of slickness and I cannot wait to get a good case for it.  I would not want to carry and use the phone without a protective case.  Speed and accessibility is superior to the phone I replaced (Z2Force).  It does everything a little better (so far).  The camera is good, but not the AMAZING I was expecting.  The 'Night Vision' is just okay.  The camera on my original Z Droid seemed to take as good of pictures and the z2Force was just comparable.  I was expecting a huge upgrade on the camera with so many megapixels.  I won't say I'm disappointed with the new camera, I'm just not amazed with it.  All-in-all, I would say this is a superior phone to the z2 I replaced.  Once again, this is an initial blush.  My z2Force has a huge history of durability and almost 2 years of flawless operation, as did my ZDroid. For some reason, I don't have that confidence in this one the way I did when I went from the ZDroid to the z2 Force.  I don't have a specific reason for this feeling.  Perhaps it's the unfinished look, the slimness and how it's practically slippery.  I absolutely love most of the Moto gestures but miss the command word from the ZDroid (still).

If you don't want or need a good camera the g series has pretty good phones aswell. Only things that really bother me about it is that my old g6 had a flash in the front and a mode called torch mode where it stayed lit for selfies.

Guessing there is a setting somewhere?? And when talking on the phone the screen keeps turning on and ends up muting calls, changing to speaker or requests video call. Husband got same phone. Usually has speaker mod attached, which is kind of heavy but sounds good ,but also keeps blinking red light and there are no notifications on phone.

The camera is probably what I'm most impressed by, it's obviously not the best but I think it's pretty nice. The flash on the front is pretty cool for selfies. The Emojis aren't the best but I was more than happy to see you can change the colors and it has a lot of new emojis added like iPhone.

No issues so far. It's the best phone for daily use at low price in the market. Regular users can use it for day-to-day. High end phone users can keep this as backup."^5^September 7, 2017

It runs the latest Android OS and although I had to root the device in order to place it on a different network I will say that wasn't difficult to do at all."^5^September 18, 2017
SmartPhoneVirgin, ^953073971^16^11^"Bought this very same phone for my wife from Amazon for $99. They sold it unlocked & we set it up with Republic Wireless. Republic had the cheapest prepaid plan: $20 for 1GB wireless data + unlimited calls/text [on the T-Mobile network] + unlimited data when using your wireless network at home [or any wifi network anywhere]. It was our 1st smartphone and she couldn't be happier to finally upgrade from her old flip phone. So then I bought this phone from Walmart for $40, to replace my old flip phone. It is the same phone as my wife's, only it is locked to Verizon. 

We had an old Verizon family plan for our flip phones that cost us $85/month. My wife's phone came with a new phone #. When I got this Verizon-locked phone from Walmart I did NOT activate it as the instructions wanted me to do. I just put in the battery. Then I called Verizon and told them I wanted to make a change to our family plan.

Told them I wanted to keep one of the phone #s on that plan, and use it on a new prepaid Verizon plan. I wanted the other # on the family plan to be ported to another carrier [Republic Wireless].

Since I hadn't done anything on this new Verizon-locked Walmart-bought phone [other than put in the battery], the Verizon rep handled EVERYTHING for me on the phone. In less than 10 minutes the rep had my new phone up & running, keeping the same phone # I had, and taking the first payment of $40 for my new Verizon prepaid plan [3GB/month of wireless data + unlimited calls/text + unlimited wifi data].

We then googled up the Republic Wireless website to port over my wife's existing phone # she has with Verizon. It was really easy to do [the only problem was Republic doesn't want you to enter the 'dash' character that is part of the Verizon account #. It failed until we realized 'hey, let's try NOT putting in the 'dash' and VOILA! It accepted it our request to port my wife's #].

In less than 24 hours from having walked out of Walmart with this phone, my wife and I each now have this moto e4 phone and they both have the same phone numbers we previously had.

If Republic Wireless service proves to be ok, I plan on switching this Verizon-locked moto e4 over to Republic. Many people have done this; this moto e4 CAN work on any network, it's just that this Verizon-locked version of it has had all the other networks disabled. To enable it to work on other networks, people just get an unlock code, easily bought on ebay for $2. [You also would need to buy a sim card for another network].

So our $85/month flip-phone family-plan is now gone. Verizon sent a confirming email to us that the account is deactivated now that there no longer are any phones on it. Woo hoo!

$42/month for this moto e4 + $20/month for my wife's Republic moto e4 = $23 less than I had been paying for flip-phone-only service. Woo hoo again!

In a month I expect to save another $19/month when I unlock this Verizon-locked moto e4 & switch it over to Republic. WOO HOO!"^5^October 4, 2017
Marcia, ^953073971^16^4^"I'm a Samsung person but when my phone broke, I had to find something I could afford right away. Read the reviews and got the E4. So far I'm really pleased! Was tricky figuring out how to get apps to save to the SD card. Lots of settings to deal with that were different from my previous phones. Less bloatware on this phone which is a huge plus. Can't beat the price. Of course it's not going to do all that a high end (and high priced) phone will do but it does everything I want it to do."^5^October 2, 2017
Ellie, ^953073971^13^21^"I have this phone for a year. It's my first smartphone. I use speaker function on calls to be heard better.  I have an Otterbox case & have dropped it many times. Screen is also rugged. Memory is only 8G, so it's running low. Battery holds a good charge. It only comes with wall charger - not a component cable - so buy a cable if you charge in the car. I'm going to buy the E4 next - 16G should last me longer."^5^September 17, 2017
Brandon0239ht943, ^953073971^13^3^"This phone is fast and weighted perfectly for a premium feel. The thing that most surprised me was how sharp the screen resolution is. It may only be 720p but it looks much sharper than that. As good as my 1080p screen on my s8+. The downloads are incredibly fast. Surprisingly fast, even. The web browsing is the exact same story: Surprisingly fast. This amazing phone is very close to being a flagship-replacer.  I use it as my backup phone and I'd recommend it to anyone, anywhere for any usage."^5^October 8, 2017
Sam1955, ^953073971^12^3^"I have 5 of these phones! (4 Verizon pre-paid versions and 1 unlocked version directly from Motorola) I had originally heard about this phone on Amazon. There was a lengthy review from a guy who's had at least 25 or more Android phones in his life and he raved about this phone. I was going to get the flagship OnePlus phone but he convinced me to give this one a try. The only question, since this is a locked phone, was whether or not it would work with a GSM carrier like AT&T. The answer: It DOES work on GSM carriers (Verizon is a CDMA carrier, which is different. But the phone can handle both.)

I originally ordered the unlocked version directly from Motorola, but it got hung up in some weird customs paperwork red tape so I decided to run up to Walmart, buy the locked Verizon version, and see if it worked (with an unlock code readily available on eBay for around $2). It worked like a charm, so while they had my 'real' E4 tied up in customs for a week, I started using this $40 version in its place. I liked it so much I ran up and got another Verizon $40 phone (+ $2.20 for the unlock code) before I ever received my 'real' E4. 

Interestingly, I actually prefer the pre-paid version to the 'real' version. It has some nice built-in features (like the ability to click a box and get a numerical percentage of the remaining battery life without having to install a separate app) and the updates are more regular with the Verizon version than with the Motorola version. This phone is quick, bright, has great battery life (AND a replaceable battery!) and has a lot of nice features, like a fingerprint scanner that actually works. Personally, I prefer its 5' size to the larger 5.5' size of the E4 Plus. And you just can't beat the price. 

I did do one thing that really made this phone a grand slam, because the internal 16GB of memory is a little inadequate. I activated the 'Developer Options' hidden feature (Google to find out how to do that) and afterwards selected the 'Force allow apps on external' option from within the 'Developer Options' section. This is critical to allow an added memory card to absorb some app data. Without this option, the internal memory will eventually get overloaded; WITH this option, the phone is perfect. NOTE: This approach is different than formatting the memory card as 'Internal' (vs portable). That option, available after Android 5, is a nightmare. This option basically does the same thing but without all the headaches associated with formatting the memory card as 'Internal'. (Google that if you want a whole list of the problems encountered.) 

This is, without a doubt, the best phone on the planet for the price. In fact, it's better than a lot of phones costing 10 times as much."^5^November 23, 2017
Dedlebug, ^953073971^8^12^"I was amazed at the features this phone has,  for the price.  I took one star off for the finger print recognition.  It frequently won't recognize my print and I need to put the code in.  Not a big deal, but the one on my eye pad works much better.  Also, in the instruction booklet it lists an option for those using a smart phone for the first time.  I followed to instructions to get that option, but it just wasn't there on the phone.  Otherwise, I'm happy with the phone and still learning about all its options.  I love just telling 'Google' to put an appt. on the calendar, and it does it.  Very impressed, being a first time Smart phone user.  I sure old hands at this will think nothing of it.  ;)"^4^March 15, 2018
richmondva, ^953073971^7^52^"Okay I read stupendous reviews about this phone which is why I decided to give it a try. Here are the things that I have yet to read after reading 75 reviews and here's the deal everyone who writes these reviews says essentially the same thing it's like the sheeple are making the reviews so here are the things about the phone that I found good. First let's put things in perspective I never pay more than 30 or 40 bucks a phone. Coming from that this phone is fast it's got beautiful screen visual colors and it has a pretty good camera better than 0.3 front-facing I'm used to okay now let me tell you what absolutely sucks about this phone. The caller log I've had 30 phones over the last 20 years and all of them have had when you hit your phone a call log is somewhere that you can just tap it and look at it I'm talking all your calls calls you make calls that are coming in cause you missed it's in one line this phone oh no you hate your phone and immediately your son to a it automatically applies favorites to random contacts you've entered so you just going to throw you into a favorite box then you have to scroll to your history and it's going to show you a scaled-down history from there you have to go up to the top right-hand screen hit the three dots hit call history then you can see your call history and then only the calls you taken you have to slide the screen over to see cause you've missed. I realize a lot of people do not talk on the phone so if you don't talk on the phone this is a non-issue I spend a lot of time on the phone I do a lot of business on the phone. There is no reason why I should spend more than one or two tops looking for my call log this is like a six-step 7-step process just to see what calls you've missed,ridiculous. The next issue is there's no way to change the colors of your phone you get to gray or orange orange is battery saving grace is normal next no way to hide your Caller ID if you wanted to for there's no audio recorder so you have to install one there's also New Media Player so when you record a video you have to go to your photos which is stored online and the use Google photos to player video. I can go on and on about how I've spent six hours trying to work around the fundamental basics That are missing from this phone"^3^November 8, 2017

dkruchoski, ^953073971^5^3^"I ordered this phone and picked it up yesterday.  The first thing I did was put the battery in.  It was difficult for me to get the back snapped back on but I decided to charge it up and then worry about it later.  Well, there is a bump in the corner of the battery which makes it impossible for the case to close completely.  It would not turn on at all.  Now I have to return it and re-purchase it.  Buyers...if you pick it up at the store, make sure they check to ensure the battery fits.  If one is like this - there will be other defective ones out there.  Great price for this so I am going to try again but only once more.  If I continue to have issues with this - on to a Samsung."^2^March 18, 2018

Luke, ^953073971^3^2^"The battery life of the device is next to pitiful. It will take 8 hours for it to fully charge and by 4.5 hours the battery run completely dead. As for the hardware it runs as to be expected, but the whole casing and exterior of the phone is less than impressive. I would rather go back to the Moto G-play I had than give this overpriced paperweight a good review. The E4 has a terrible tendency to overheat if it is laid down for a minute. Even when charging you'd think the device is ready to catch fire. I almost hesitate placing the phone in my pocket for fear of the thought that it might overheat just sitting in my pocket at work. The only positive this E4 has over my old G-play is that this has fingerprint unlock to it. Makes unlocking the phone way easier and faster. Still I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone over the Moto G-play. By the way, they phone is Black NOT Silver. The label lied."^1^May 15, 2018

Bkelly217, ^504312210^2^0^"I'm definitely an Apple junkie, in other words, all of my technology is Apple. 
Prior to getting my iPhone 8, I had an iPhone 6. I feel the iPhone 6, 7, and 8 are pretty comparable in looks and features. I had already downloaded the new software on my iPhone 6 prior to upgrading, so I basically saw what my new iPhone 8 would be like. 
Despite the models being fairly similar, I'm definitely still happy with my upgrade. Obviously the phone itself is faster and doesn't experience as many glitches as older models. 
I have experience a few issues with software updating, to the point where it's had go into recovery mode. I have my phone backed up, so it's not a huge downfall, just annoying. 
I definitely feel the Touch ID settings are much more accurate and easier to use opposed to older models. 
I have the gold model and I have to say I love the color! The back is also a glass material as opposed to the old metal casing. 
This material definitely feels more durable. I have a cheap and compact case on my phone, and it has still survived my toddler throwing it on our wood floor! 
If screen size is what you're looking for, I would definitely go with a plus or X model. For me, I like that the regular model is small enough to hold in one hand, but still has a decent screen size. 
For it being the brand new model, I definitely love my 8 despite the software glitches and updates!"^5^February 6, 2018

Disgruntled, ^49053823^36^9^"As soon as I opened the box I knew it wasnt going to be good. The plastic protective covering on the phone was all crinkled and I noticed the charger and box were not even Apple brand, but some off brand Ive never heard of. There are no headphones included with the phone either. So I remove the protective plastic which wasnt even stuck to it anyway because there was dirt all over it. The earphone on the phone (where you put it up to your ear) was caked with dirt, and the screen had water spots all over it. The apple logo on the back was scratched. This was clearly not a phone that someone returned within the 2 week return period and then it was checked out and resold as refurbished. Thats what I thought it was, but I was wrong. This phone had clearly been used for a long time as gross as it looks. Im returning it and will not be buying anything 'refurbished' again, no matter how good the price is. I cant tell you if the phone even works properly or not because Im not wasting my time turning it on and setting it up, or if the battery even holds a charge. I doubt they put a new battery in it before selling it since it wasnt even cleaned up."^1^January 16, 2017

KRichOk, ^49053823^17^1^"First, my phone arrived a month after I ordered it, after the 'expected arrival date' changed 3 times. I contacted Walmart who gave me the companies contact information. They did not respond to me until Walmart contacted them and escalated my case to a higher level. I finally received my phone to find out that the microphone does not work. I contacted the company about this and they offered me $25 to get it fixed. The cheapest place I could find is $50. They told me that is too expensive. I then told them I wanted to return the phone because it was defective. They stopped responding to me. I contacted Walmart again who tried to contact them. They didn't answer Walmart. Walmart then issued me a refund for the phone and told me they would handle the situation from that point forward. I ended up taking the phone into a certified repair store to get their opinion on the phone and they informed me that he could tell immediately it was refurbished and after further investigation their had been a lot of things replaced that were not Apple parts. He said the phone has software issues and that with each update it will have more and more issues. DO NOT BUY ANY PHONE FROM THIS COMPANY. I know the price looks good but these phones are not legit and should be pulled from Walmart's website."^1^September 1, 2017

I asked to change with the different color like they offered before, they said the offer is canceled, it is too late ( that is after 3 days only from receiving the phone).they offered a refund, but I refused to return the phone, I know they will deduct a lot of money and say it is used. be careful from this company."^1^November 24, 2016

Ryeo, ^942387075^244^63^"Despite being confused to no end in which phone to get I finally made a sensible choice in the G6. I would have gotten the Moto X but I did not want a tiny screen. I love the Moto gestures, the flashlight never fails to impress and it's always a good laugh when people try it with their phone plus the camera is much faster than opening it manually. The phone runs very smooth and has all the features I will need. There's some nice upgrades in this phone with a decent camera, octa core processor, Dolby Digital, and the full HD. The phone is also pretty amazing with such a thin bezel it feels very manageable despite the large screen. Feels much smaller than my old X with the same size screen."^5^June 24, 2018

Previous phones Nokia 640, Samsung Galaxy s 5 active, Galaxy s 3.  Biggest sell was good specs for camera.  No complaints so far.  Battery life awesome!  Love the fingerprint scanner.  Always use a case so sturdiness seems fine but not too concerned one way or other.  Nice Google features.  Love that it isn't already loaded with apps I can pick and choose.  Motorola seems to be getting more expensive on their budget line, but still chose the g6 and am happy."^5^June 26, 2018

I'm not a gamer, but the G6 is very responsive and fast. Some early reviews have dinged the camera as slow, but I have not experienced that at all, with the time from when I activate to taking a picture being about a second. The screen if bright and colors are balanced. The fingerprint sensor is also much improved over the G5, which I thought was a bit inconsistent in recognizing my fingerprint."^5^June 1, 2018

I have no idea why Motorola/Lenovo would get rid of it. I could drive down the road and never take my hands off the wheel or eyes off the road.

In addition to all the phones being reliable, and long-lasting, I love that they have allowed me to carrier shop, allowing even more savings. I do wich the 6 had stayed waterproof like my previous Moto G, and I wish all of them had more responsive cameras... it takes way too long to snap a picture.

USP40GUY, ^942387075^32^0^"Unless you like spending 4X's more money for a flagship phone, then you'll appreciate the value proposition of the G6. This G6 will be a workhorse that has a sturdy build feel. OS is Android 8.0. The fingerprint reader, which also controls One Button Navigation, is my favorite feature. Usability is excellent, the Snapdragon processor is plenty fast for most apps and functions. My only wish is that it had NFC. The camera has equivalent functionality as many Point 'N' Shoot standalone cameras do, and the results are very good. Battery time is only average, would have preferred a longer lasting 3200 mAh. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase, and the price is reasonable for the hardware configuration. Motorola has a tradition of packing a lot of value into their phones."^5^July 26, 2018

The brand new phone was unresponsive, and ultimately my husband had to do a hard reset of the phone. I had the phone for an hour. I took a few pictures with it, and the camera seemed like a good camera. I really wanted to like this phone but it appears this reboot loop is actually an issue other customers are having. Now I have to pay to return the brand new phone that doesn't work. For these reasons, I'd encourage you to look twice before you purchase this phone. I cannot recommend this phone.

PhantomZ, ^942387075^31^1^"I bought this phone a couple months ago and I am glad that I did. My previous phone was the Moto G3, but I wanted something new. At first I thought the G6 was too long, but I got used to it quickly. It looks and feels really nice in your hand. The battery also lasts all day. The fingerprint sensor works well. I have my left and right thumb and index fingers saved to unlock the phone. The phone also gets my friend's attention, because it is just a sleek phone. The camera is also pretty good. I attached a photo I took of my university. The phone does scratch easily and is slippery, so a case may be a good idea. I have gotten some scratches on my phone, because I used to put in in my car's cupholder and the back of the phone got a few scratches just from driving. The phone can also be slippery  This is a great phone for kids and people who don't need all the high-end features. It is also unlocked, so you have more freedom.

Never has a screen break before this one.  It is super slick and very easily slips out of one's hands.  Getting a cover case as soon as you purchase it is highly recommended.

The glass-back shattered into pieces in spite of having protecting back-cover.I had the phone in my pocket while I was boarding train, later I took it out only to realize the glass-back has broke into pieces,also the phone had a slight bend to it.  However, I got the glass back repaired from service center after paying extra money(As any kind of physical damage is not covered in the warranty even if it is in span of couple of weeks of purchase). A week after that camera stopped functioning and had to make another trip to the service center. There I was told motherboard of the phone has a bent and was told  that the product cannot be further repaired as it was due to physical damage. Also now the display is flickering. I have two Moto G5 plus in my family, impressed by its performance especially sturdiness I decided to go for Moto G6 plus. It turned out to be quiet opposite.

Even inside a decent case I have noticed scratches all along the camera bezel and even on the screen. You can say goodbye to the sleek glass back, I doubt it will last a week anywhere outside an isobaric chamber. It runs fine (camera is slow but no complaints otherwise).

Never expected this to happen from a brand like moto. I have been using other devices with gorilla glass for years now and they fell hard on variety of surfaces but never cracked like this.

Also I did not want to be tied into a two contract with my current carrier but wanted to take advantage of those savings minus a contract. I have only had this phone for three weeks now and have become comfortable in using it. It has many of the features your  higher end phones have without the higher cost. BeforeI had a Motorola Droid  which worked well for me and this why I stayed with Motorola.

Gimpy23, ^942387075^9^0^"I purchased the G6 to replace my aging S,4. I did a lot of research and finally chose this based on the combination of the specs & price. I wanted to pay for the phone vs paying the carrier over time. This phone does nearly everything that the phones costing twice (or much more) and the few things that may be missing are functions I probably wouldn't use & would never miss. I had no problems transferring all of my data and apps and everything converted seemlessly. The speed has been very impressive and the camera has performed well.  The battery charges very quickly and holds the charge for a good life  Had I realized how easy the conversion would be, I would have made the move much sooner."^5^March 2, 2019

The new phone is very good looking, has the features I like (including a terrific camera!), but it's all glass, and TOO SLIPPERY. I never dropped my old phone once in three years. The new phone is constantly falling out of my pocket, sliding off my desk (admittedly a mess of papers) or slipping out of my hand. The EXT had a rubbery coating on the back that made it stay out even on less-than-level surfaces. I know the glass is the latest look, but functionally it's a terrible idea."^4^September 12, 2018

The fingerprint recognition works quite well.  I am pleased this phone did not come with a lot of bloatware and apps that generate a lot of ads.  It has been pretty much ad free for me.

Scorecard, ^942387075^6^2^"For 15 months I used the Moto G5+ and loved it. It did everything I needed, had a long battery, and looked great. I dropped it and cracked it while at an indoor pool. I went right out and purchased a Moto G6 the same day. I used the G6 for 48 hours and returned it. The phone had trouble handling basic apps and it kept crashing on one of the larger ones I use. The battery also was a major let down, it wouldn't make it a complete day for me and I consider myself an average user. This was also the first all glass phone I had, and I didn't like that just for durability reasons. Overall it's an average phone, but doesn't live up to the prior model.

The camera sucks, it takes ridiculous lengths of time to load or process anything, there is literally a lag as I am typing this out at this very moment.  This phone is so bad, the developers didn't even think to add in a gallery for pictures.  That's right there's a camera but no gallery to view the pictures you take.  You literally have to download a random gallery app.  Outside of that I don't receive people's texts and my texts often don't get sent.  It randomly freezes, and turns itself off to reboot itself while I'm in the middle of something important once a day minimum. The battery life is the only redeeming quality. People call this phone a value... Find an extra $200 and buy yourself a real phone I can't take this thing anymore!  I'm not crazy, I've never even reviewed anything before but my experience has been so overwhelmingly bad with this product that I had to write this.

I was becoming more and more enthralled and thrilled with the features of the phone.  It was perfect! I was adjusting all the apps. Then I tried to use Google Pay at a NFC terminal at my local gas station. Oh, NO!  Why was this feature not on this perfect phone. It breaks my heart to return this phone. I have researched and tried the features on some high end phones and they just didn't match up to this phone. However I thought NFC was available on all phones. I know better now as I have done extensive research on NFC now.  I have an X4 now but even though it is a more expensive, higher end phone, I don't like it as much as my 'perfect' phone. I will miss it. If you don't use, want or need NFC, I cannot recommend this phone enough. I only give it an average due to my experience."^4^October 25, 2018

Other than the fact that there wasn't an easy way to transfer text message history and voicemails there aren't many negative things to say about it. It does everything I needed to do and it does it all pretty well. It has all the fancy features we've all come to expect from our phones.

3rdtimebuyer, ^942387075^3^1^"Bought this a week ago and disappointed by how slick it is. Holding a wiggling, slippery fish is easier to handle than this phone. Have already had it slip multiple times, even just watching slide on nearly flat surfaces because of how slick the back is. I was a previous user of the Moto G and the G4 after that, but I can't say that I'll be a user of whatever follows this the G6.

Jerome1531, ^942387075^3^0^"I bought my Moto G6 smartphone in October 2018 as a early birthday present to me as I upgraded from my Moto G4. I love the duel 12 MP + 5 MP camera for portraits. There is also a 8 MP front facing camera for selfies. A 3000 Mah Battery that comes in the box with a Turbo Charger that charges my phone quickly when needed. I enjoy the fingerprint scanner and face recognition software. Just make sure that you get a case for your phone. I has also been a long time Motorola cell phone fan starting with an original bag phone in 1993. Then in 1998, a Moto Star Tec phone, in 2002 a Moto V-60 flip phone. In addition, in 2006 I got a Moto Q and in 2008 I upgraded to a Moto Q2 phone. In 2012, I purchased a Motorola Atrix smartphone. In addition, in October 2016 I got my hands on a Moto G4 smartphone until I upgraded"^5^November 24, 2018

Steven in Boston, ^942387075^3^0^"I have been using this phone for about 6 months and I really like the phone. The phone is built with a glass back which is quite strong but with all glass case enclosures you should buy a gel case which has a bumper edge for the front, they are inexpensive even for a very good one, and also with all phones install a glass screen shield, not plastic, but glass. This will give a well protected phone but still in a relatively trim package."^4^April 3, 2019

Deezzyy, ^942387075^2^0^"I absolutely love this device. the price is so low for a premium looking a feeling device. the software is not overly packed with useless software the moto features are very useful and I love them. it does have its limitations when running heavy apps or multitasking you can sometimes feel the difference in power from a flagship device. but with that, you do get USB-c all glass frame which is subjective. a nice camera. front flash aand a full-size 1080p panel. can't ask for much more.  the drawbacks for me are that I did manage to crack the rear glass even with a case on my phone just by sitting down into the car. so it is very weak glass. and I wish it was actually ip6x rated for water/dust proofing. water repellant coating is nonsense to me. all in all, I daily drive this phone and I haven't had the need to look at something in the flagship lineup at all since I got it.  had the g6 play prior to this and I like the 4000mah battery in that one as well both awesome mid-tier devices for a budget-minded power user that still doesn't want to sacrifice the high end feel and look.  excuse my grammar and punctuation. late night quick review don't feel like being picky about it."^4^January 25, 2019

The battery however drains in about 10-12 hours with normal use, so if you're a person without a charger handy during the day to top it off (which is does quickly IF you use the turbo charger) don't bother.

The all day charge?  Yeah, not happening.  I run out of battery life by sundown on most days, and I have a few hours left of the day before I go to bed after sundown.  Sundown is  like 7pm.   And I do not surf the web much at all!  I am a mom and use my phone for photos, texting, and occasional web if I want to check the price of something or look at my instagram.  I don't snapchat, I don't surf, I am a basic mom when it comes to phones lol.  So I can't understand why it's running out of battery so fast.  The fingerprint location is HORRIBLE.  I hate it!  The moto 5 had it on the back, you can easily use the fingerprint while holding the phone. Your fingers are already there, or close by.  But this one?  It's a small strip on the FRONT of the phone.  Your fingers are not there!  Your PALM is!  Why the heck did they do that?  They shouldn't have moved the fingerprint location.  That was really dumb and I HATE it there.

Literally less than a 3 inch drop from out of my pocket and onto the ground. Overall the phone seems to lag when trying to do just about anything. Press on something and there's a good 3 sec delay before it registers. Less than a year and the audio jack acts funky. It's only play at full volume if you put pressure inward on the cable. Cable works fine on other devices. The charge port is also failing already as well. Bad solder joints or something. Need to bend the thing and aim in order to get it to charge at all.

Dual camera lenses on rear spectacular and have so many filters and modes to capture moments frozen in time as vivid as memory! Panoramic photo mode allows 360 capture. So much more.

Rjfinch, ^49053850^45^17^"The iPhone six has offered many improvements since the last generation of iPhones. I have owned an iPhone 6 for roughly a year, and you will be thoroughly impressed with the way Apple has improved the features rather than just solely introducing new features. 

The first feature that will catch your eye is the fingerprint scanner in the home button. The way Apple has seemingly perfected this feature will make you never want to give it up, because of how convenient it is. 

The second improvement is the larger screen and a sleek thinning design. Although the increase of screen size creates somewhat of an inconvenience in storage it makes your streaming, gaming or typing much easier. If you game you will enjoy the extra space on the screen when using a d-pad. 

There has also been a pretty substantial improvement to the battery life of the iPhone 6 model compared to the earlier iPhone 5 models. You are able to talk on the phone for four to six more hours depending on the model of iPhone 5 you are comparing to. Also, you will be able to enjoy nearly ten extra hours of audio playback.

The iPhone 6 is much more reliable compared to that of my previous iPhone 5s. The amount of crashes has been pretty minimal in comparison.  After a year of use I can count the amount of crashes on one hand. The lack of crashes will make the use of the iPhone 6 less stressful for you in comparison to earlier models. 

The last improvement we are going to discuss, and one of the main selling points for all iPhones, is the camera quality. I am not a very frequent picture taker, but there has been a good improvement to the quality due to the improvement to stabilization.

Overall the iPhone 6 has many improvements that are a big step in the right direction for Apple. The list of improvements to the iPhone 6 is pretty long, but the battery life, reliability and fingerprint scanner will have you loving the iPhone 6. I would recommend the iPhone 6 if you are looking for a user-friendly phone, love high quality pictures, or are a fan of Apple products."^4^September 23, 2016

Nothing happened. We were never able to even turn it on. We took it to our local AT&T store to see if they could charge it. But they couldn't either.  So we wanted to return it. But it didn't come from Walmart but Quick Wireless instead. It was not an easy return process. And we are now only get a portion of our money back. I don't understand why. We even had to pay for the shipping to return it. We are out about $110 from buying it."^1^November 2, 2017

Isaac, ^50132310^4^0^"I was hoping the other reviews weren't true but they are.

After waiting for this item to slowwwly ship to me, I inserted my AT&T sim card to get an error message saying that my sim card is not supported by this device. You can see the error message in the image I included.

This device was marketed as an AT&T device when I ordered it through Walmart.com and therefore should obviously work with an AT&T sim card.

Really unfortunate that this device does not work, and now a hassle to deal with returning it. Save your time and don't purchase this device.

Sidenote: AT&T sim cards will work on an iPhone 6, 6s, and 7 if the phone is from AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile. The only incompatible carrier phones are Sprint devices. Not sure if the same can be said for android phones though, or the iPhone 5S or 5."^1^January 17, 2017

Jerems, ^50909946^1^0^"We were looking for the biggest iPhone 6s we could find and it took a little digging. It's strange how it wasn't right up front. When you go to a car dealer they don't put the junk in the showroom, they put the greatest one in the showroom and make you have to dig around for the cheaper ones. Strange.
Anyway, my kid is a true Millennial and wanted an iPhone 6s 128GB for vlogging. He already has an iPhone as his regular phone so he knows his way around it perfectly well. I am confident that when he said he went through the entire phone and said nothing was wrong with any part of it I believed him. He said there was not one scratch on the glass or the body, the camera lens was clear and had no scratches, every app worked exactly the way it's supposed to, and the memory was all intact. The only thing different was that it didn't come in a fancy box and the charger cable and brick didn't seem to be the Apple Factory kind but still worked perfectly fine. 
In our case we didn't find one physical thing wrong with the iPhone 6s and would recommend this product."^5^March 5, 2017

VALU, ^49230903^2^0^"I was skeptical when I first thought of buying an Apple IPHONE from Walmart, but I read the reviews and that put my mind at ease.  So I decided to try it for myself.  I wanted to pay less money, and I wanted a phone that was GSM capable and unlocked.  My current service is with Verizon Wireless and I was not even sure if the phone would work with their current service/system.  I wanted a GSM because I will be traveling in the near future to Europe and I wanted to have service in Europe without taking on expensive roaming charges from my current wireless company.  I was a little worried when the phone arrived in a brown box inside of a plastic bag and a charger that did not resemble an Apple charger.  Well to my surprise the phone did not come with GSM Sim Card, I called Verizon Wireless and they told me that they can ship me a Sim card the next day and I received it with my new number attached, I placed the SIM card into the phone and then I  powered the phone on and made calls outgoing and incoming.  The phone was used/refurbished and it works great.  I have no complaints it is as if it was brand new....no complaints whatsoever.  I purchased this one for my child and I will be upgrading at a later date to buy an Unlocked GSM phone for myself as well....the price was great at $179.00 and all I did was add it to my existing plan for $20.00 a month with Verizon Wireless.  I would definitely recommend going this route if you want to avoid a costly phone for $600.00 or more and also avoid one and two year contracts with your wireless provider.  The phone only has 16gigs, but again I purchased for my young child and now I can track them, face-time them and call them when they are playing at their friends house.  its great and I am completely happy with it.  They have newer phones for a little bit more money, but I'm happy with my purchase.  My only complaint is that it did not come with an Apple Earbud.  I have to purchase that separately.  Also the GSM phones do not come with SIM Cards, you have to call your provider or go to the local store to have them assign one or send to your home."^5^February 5, 2017

^50132337^8^2^"'None of the these units are unlocked for domestic use. ' - to quote another review - this is actually completely false. Many people, myself included, received a mint condition, completely unlocked phone, with original box and accessories, a brand new battery, and warranty until November '16 or later.

Unfortunately, others seem to have received locked phones from Sprint, AT&T, and even T-Mobile. So it seems to be random luck as to whether you get an unlocked or locked phone. Still, all are in great shape.

Walmart has updated the title to 'AT&T (Locked)' from '(Unlocked)' in the past few days. According to a 70+ page Slickdeals thread, what you get is random."^3^April 7, 2016

I am ordering my third AT&T version of the phone. The first two came locked to the Sprint network and had to return them. 

Inside the box, there was a card that showed that the phones were refurbished  by TheReconGroup. The card clearly states the product is fully inspected, quality tested, and restored to the highest standard. Clearly someone was trying to make a joke there.

WAtrust, ^43193742^1^0^"This seller  ' Alphas Electronics and Toys' gave me hard time for over one week.
I ordered the phone online and received it on time.

Tried to charge it, with different chargers, the battery never went more than 4%, I contacted them they send me an email saying that I have to pay 20% restocking fees, the next day the send me another email and saying that they will charge 25% restocking fees, and if the phone is not defective they would charge me 50% restocking fees!!

I returned the phone and they really took 25% restocking fees!

Is this is the way how these people make money? They send defective items to the their customers and they put them in the situation to choose between accepting the defective part or return it and loose 25% + the shipment!!!?? That's horrible!

Also they sent me an email saying that the reason I returned the phone is: 'Customer Changed Min' which is not true! Also they said ' An adjustment have been made to this order showing that i bought the phone for 50.12 which it the amount that they took as 25% restocking fees.

I just wanted to warn people from getting trapped with this seller and to have hard time with them like they did with me for the only reason that I trusted their business!

I contacted Walmart.com since I bought the phone from their website, they took care of me and sent me a gift card refunding the 25% that  'Alphas Electronics and Toys' basically took in a bad way.

rrnyc, ^118266498^11^6^"I had this phone for a week. The design is great: size, screen, bezels, materials. That's where the good things stop. I am coming from years of Nexus and Pixel phones with clean, stock Android. I do not understand Samsung's need to shove down my throat bloatware and duplicate services like Samsung Pass, Pay, Phone, Camera, One UI, etc. I prefer the similar services from Google which are part of pure Android. The Samsung apps cannot be removed and they're simply annoying. The Google Phone and Camera apps cannot be installed on this Samsung phone. In my opinion, they're much better than their Samsung counterparts, Battery life is horrible. I am a light user and the battery struggles to keep up. Overall, I am not impressed. After all, this is just a temporary phone until 5G arrives."^2^April 7, 2019

sammyp42, ^118266498^10^1^"I've been a Samsung Android user since 2012, have been a happy user of the Galaxy S (Vibrant), S3, S4, S7, S9.  I have been able to avoid the phones that have had major issues for Samsung... nothing exploding or anything.  Overall, but quite pleased.  The S10e was no exception, I loved it out of the box.  I got i on March 14th and it worked flawlessly... until just a day ago.  For some reason the battery started draining unusually fast.  Yesterday the phone ran hot all day and I had to charge it every 2hrs or so...seemed kinda unusual, disabling Wi-Fi seemed to help so I figured I would keep an eye on things.  Then, last night before I could charge it for the night, the battery died.  However, I could not charge it anymore!  It's now an expensive brick!  First time in 8 years I've had this sort of issue with a Samsung phone!  I'll give Samsung benefit of the doubt and get this replaced and see if the new one works w/o issue.  Hopefully they get the kinks out, I really liked the phone and want to use it!  Until the battery draining issue suddenly started, the phone worked awesome and held a charge almost all day... better than any phone I've used in the past!"^3^March 27, 2019

However, now I have to pay for text voicemail, and the fingerprint reader is an absolute joke. Four times out of 5, it doesn't work. This shouldn't be a feature if it's not reliable, and it's difficult to add the fingerprint as well. Perhaps moving it off from the side would improve its utility.

Phone was brand new looking but spent hours talking to AT&T an Apple and still no network connection. Getting a 'SIM NOT SUPPORTED' error during initial setup. Apple claims its locked to Sprint. AT&T says they can see the iemi on their network but don't know why it's not connecting.  This was th Space Gray 16gb variant from TheReconGroup.com

RedSonja, ^128846184^2^3^"I purchased this phone to upgrade my current Straight Talk Apple iPhone 5 that had worked well for the past four years, but had been released before Straight Talk offered LTE coverage and had limited storage for a picture happy mom of 3. I knew my coverage area gets more reliable service with CDMA phones than GSM, so I looked for a Verizon phone that could be used with Straight Talk's bring your own device; I did need to purchase the separate SIM card made for CDMA phones because my current Straight Talk iPhone did not use one (cost me a whole 99 cents from Walmart.com with free site to store shipping). Activation was easy. There is one spot on the edge of the phone that has a scuff, but I expected as much from a refurbished phone, and I keep mine in a case so no one can see it. My iCloud back up transferred flawlessly with all of my apps and settings. I haven't had any problems with apps launching /running. I'm very happy with my purchase and the money I saved."^5^March 7, 2017

Not a fingerprint, smudge or scratch in sight. It was in a sealed original box, and the phone and all the accessories inside were also wrapped like new. I used the Net10 sim card from my iPhone 5s, and the service came up right away. I was able to restore from the backup of that phone and everything went smoothly and is working. I also checked on the Apple website, and it was showing that I had a whole year of warranty coverage which was an added bonus.

I received a sealed Apple iphone 6s plus with ALL new accessories. The device had not one single scratch or blemish on it. Perfect condition actually. Here's the cherry on top.  Description says LOCKED to AT&T!! However to my surprise during the unboxing process, my device was indeed UNLOCKED. I was fully prepare to try an unlock this thing through at&t's unlock request form. There was no need. Once I placed my sim in the device my signal appeared immediately.

BargainShopper, ^50132329^19^2^"Mine was locked to AT&T. I bought a .99 SIM Card at Walmart & it was good to go with Straight Talk

The Phone was in an original iPhone 6S Plus box. It had new earplugs in case & charger & cord.

If you buy, count on it being locked as my review & previous reviews have said. I called AT& T & they said they would unlock for free, but it might take 2 days.

I went the .99 SIM Card route and had the phone working in an hour.

Good Luck !"^5^April 20, 2016

I received one locked to AT&T - which is as the title reads. I have had no issues with the phone. Looks brand new out of the box. I verified if this phone could be unlocked by AT&T - It was a no go. Overall  - if you are lucky you would get a great phone - if not simply return at walmart. 

Hey Walmart - Price Match with yourself?! Mysteriously the price keeps falling. I bought it for 409$ + taxes. Now its 399$+taxes. If you have the patience to deal with potential returns - this is for you."^3^October 29, 2016

The phone arrived double boxed, so it was discrete when the ups driver dropped it off. The inside box was protected with air bags. The inside box was not the original box, but did the job just fine. The phone was delivered in great shape, no cracks or scuffs are apparent in the phone itself. It included a USB cord, power adapter, headphones, and original paperwork. All items appear to be apple products. The headphones were in the apple headphone case, the power adapter has the apple logo and part number. 
The phone was purchased as a Christmas gift. I have powered the phone up and unlocked it using the at&t unlock website. I was able to complete the process in 20 minutes and test my Total wireless sim to verify that the phone could make calls.
I know this isn't a very strenuous test on the phone, but I didn't want to ruin the Christmas surprise having the phone out and testing it for the day. Hopefully everything works as intended but in case something is wrong I purchased the 2 year Walmart warranty."^5^November 16, 2016

Eddman, ^378480974^26^7^"Let's start with the good. The note 8 is an amazing phone in terms of design and performance that leaves little to be desired elsewhere. The display is vibrant and big and it is feature packed to the max. A few things do lack still though. The batter life is kinda bad especially after coming from an s7 edge. Also the fingerprint sensor is still not in the best spot. I'm 6 feet and 3 inches tall so I have fairly large hands, I'm able to reach it just fine but I know my shorter friends struggle. The display was also a slight miss for me as it doesn't have the best daylight visibility, it seemed like my s7 edge was a bit brighter outdoors. The true downside to this phone and why I wouldn't recommend it is that it's super expensive. After owning it for a few weeks I tell all my friends don't get it and just get an s8+. It has nearly the same features (- SPen), a bigger battery, and also a cheaper price tag. I can say though if you are a note enthusiast like myself go for the note 8, you will not be disappointed if you are."^5^October 3, 2017

Chuckbeez, ^378480974^11^4^"Samsung has struck gold again with this phone. It truly is a magnificent device of the future with a stunning edge-to-edge infinity display, paired beautifully with seamless software integration and a hard-wired virtual assistant that picks up slack where Google Assistant lacks capabilities. The camera rivals the most expensive DSLRs on the market for the last ten years. It is an expensive piece of equipment, but you get the camera, a WACOM stylus, 6 GB of ram that can handle the most daunting of handheld computing tasks, VR, expandable storage or dual-sim capabilities, and a suite of biometric security features, all in a waterproof package that fits in the palm of your hand; it is justifiably one of, if not the most capable pieces of consumer technology on the market today, and it is presented in a glorious 6.3-inch, dripping-in-all-glass unit that will leave even the most die-hard Apple fans drooling.

^378480974^5^1^"The note 8 is a beautiful piece of technology. it feels great and look s great. I t has an amazing usability more than any device I've ever owned before. the ability to cut text out of pictures ! translate of of a photo with auto language detection! Its blazing fast. The only draw back is there is so much screen im in fear of damaging it constantly. I recommend getting a very durable case and a screen protector but then you will loose the beauty of the device."^5^January 27, 2018
Efrain1Nav, ^378480974^5^1^"Best Samsung Note I have had. The performance of this device meets my expectations that I would get out of a product for this price. Now even though I gave this product a high rating, doesn't mean it does not come with flaws. You will need a case for this and need to charge this device frequently if you are a heavy user. I got a case with a battery attached and that lets me use this phone from the start of my day till the time I get home with just enough time to charge it. This device is really fragile so be careful with it since it can break or bend easy if not protected in a case. I have had this device since it came out and no real issues with updates, which is great. I think they did a great job with this phone. Definitely my favourite phone up to date.

Essumer, ^378480974^4^1^"Beast of a phone. Everything about it is top of the line. I woudk recommend it to anyone who wants the best looking display with high resolution. Brightest display under sun. It's very fast. My only issue as I'm a power user is the battery. The battery needs to be bigger. If I were ti upgrade to the note 10 for instance I would hope it would have a 4500mah battery or even a new battery tech that blows lithium ions away. The display is amazing and hope it gets bumped to 4k by the note 10. The battery lasts throughout the day on normal usage but on heavy usage like I do with lots of videos and constantly on my phone, it tends to drain pretty quick. I love this phone and cannot wait to see the note 10 goodies. My wishes are for the ir blaster to return and the battery to be big or new tech. The screen res to be bumped up as well. Then of course the CPU and GPU and memory storage. All that faster and increased. Love the phone. I came from iPhone 6 and I got to say I am not going back to iPhones but sticking to the notes. Note for life. Keep the headphone Jack! Outragoues amount of features as well. It's awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^5^April 12, 2018

Bilbee79, ^378480974^3^1^"I have purchased 3 Note 8's and within 3 days the screen has broken. Most recent the phone was dropped face up in the grass and the screen broke. I think the curved glass is not what the note 8 needed. I believe the Note 5 was the best design as i have had it for couple years and not a single problem. If you have the Note 8 in your hand without a case it's very hard to use because of the curved glass. My opinion should have improved the Note 5 design and leave the curved glass to galaxy s series."^3^February 5, 2018

Eddman, ^599227309^26^7^"Let's start with the good. The note 8 is an amazing phone in terms of design and performance that leaves little to be desired elsewhere. The display is vibrant and big and it is feature packed to the max. A few things do lack still though. The batter life is kinda bad especially after coming from an s7 edge. Also the fingerprint sensor is still not in the best spot. I'm 6 feet and 3 inches tall so I have fairly large hands, I'm able to reach it just fine but I know my shorter friends struggle. The display was also a slight miss for me as it doesn't have the best daylight visibility, it seemed like my s7 edge was a bit brighter outdoors. The true downside to this phone and why I wouldn't recommend it is that it's super expensive. After owning it for a few weeks I tell all my friends don't get it and just get an s8+. It has nearly the same features (- SPen), a bigger battery, and also a cheaper price tag. I can say though if you are a note enthusiast like myself go for the note 8, you will not be disappointed if you are."^5^October 3, 2017

Chuckbeez, ^599227309^11^4^"Samsung has struck gold again with this phone. It truly is a magnificent device of the future with a stunning edge-to-edge infinity display, paired beautifully with seamless software integration and a hard-wired virtual assistant that picks up slack where Google Assistant lacks capabilities. The camera rivals the most expensive DSLRs on the market for the last ten years. It is an expensive piece of equipment, but you get the camera, a WACOM stylus, 6 GB of ram that can handle the most daunting of handheld computing tasks, VR, expandable storage or dual-sim capabilities, and a suite of biometric security features, all in a waterproof package that fits in the palm of your hand; it is justifiably one of, if not the most capable pieces of consumer technology on the market today, and it is presented in a glorious 6.3-inch, dripping-in-all-glass unit that will leave even the most die-hard Apple fans drooling. Did I mention it's cheaper than the iPhone X?"^5^September 25, 2017

DayHiker123, ^599227309^9^2^"If it was not for the S-Pen, I would not purchase the Note 8. Beautiful hardware and good specifications. But it is very frustrating that Samsung forces you to use their Samsung apps like Phone, Contacts, Bixby, Messages, Mail, etc. Google's originally version of these Apps are generally better designed. For example, the stock Phone app from Google has a nice message recording. Samsung makes you go through your phone provider to get the voice mail. "^3^September 16, 2017

I took it to T-mobile thinking it was the Sim card that wasn't working, but turns out the phones antenna was broken. I messaged customer service once again, they were very helpful.

NoPhone, ^187250892^1^0^"I bought this phone and everything seemed fine then started having problems with the battery. The phone would cut off by itself.  Then it froze and now it wont turn on at all.  The company just sent me a email asking me to send it to an apple store and they would refund me anything they charge to fix it.  The phone was bent and that was why the battery was giving me problems.  I tried calling the company and the phone goes straight to voice mail.  I emailed and got an automatic response.  I was not able to contact a person and reading the refund information from Walmart, this company wants stocking fee and more stuff, plus I have to pay for shipping for a phone that they knew was not working properly.  I understand buying a used phone will have some scratches but I should be working properly and not selling unusable phones to people.

its doesnt come with a sim card which is what makes it tracfone so it is cheaper and easier to get a att iphone. it doesnt come in the original pacaging wich creates its own problems. when you go to tracfone they ask what other provider its capible with and you cant say anything because it JUST SAYS TRACFONE. so if you are looking to get a tracfone iphone just buy a normal iphone (you can find 'em cheap.) and go to tracfone to convert it. sigh... i was so excited!"^2^June 11, 2017

I thought I would sell my air and keep the mini, but I'm having a really hard time parting with it. Every time I upgrade, I sell my old iPhone unlocked and it almost pays for the new phone.

Britt062516, ^415655858^29^5^"So my son's dad (my boyfriend) and me both decided to purchase this phone as our upgrade on our Verizon plan. We both our Samsung lovers and both really enjoyed our new phone. Well shortly after the purchase my boyfriend went on vacation and decided to take a dive into the ocean with his daughters forgetting the phone was in his pocket! By the time he realized the phone was long gone! We decided once he returned from vacation we would do a insurance claim and get him a new one. 5 days after losing his phone in the ocean, a stranger messages me on Facebook asking me if I knew whose phone this was.. I was completely astonished that after 5 days of the phone being washed away in the ocean, coming back up onto the beach and surviving 5 days in 90 degree weather in the sand it still worked!! The person found me through Facebook from me messaging my boyfriend trying to get pics of the ocean not knowing it was washed away yet! So 5 stars to samsung for manufacturing the Galaxy S9 plus and 5 stars to the kind person who returned the phone!"^5^July 23, 2018

I had a cracked water proof case on it. 1-2 mins to remove it and my phone was super hot to the touch. I put it in a bag and on ice. The case was destroyed and my phone was greasy but the rubber plugs on the case kept my ports protected and somehow right now I'm doing this review on my still amazingly working no problems phone.

I've gone a day and a half without having to charge. All the camera features make me feel like a professional photographer. The quality of the pics are amazing! The screen picture is beautiful. It looks better than my TV. The processor speed is very fast. I've not experienced any lag in the month that I've had the phone. I love Bixby!

Halsey, ^415655858^20^1^"I'm a flyfisherman, I spend quite a bit of time on the river. Unfortunately, some times you loose some flies, so gear, and maybe once your phone.... In a deep fast run. I had pretty much lost all hope the second I saw it hit the water after swinging my hip pack around to change flies and having my phone fly out of my pocket and fall down the rocks into about a 15ft real fast water. After sulking away last that evening after also loosing a monster cutty, I returned 20 hours later the next day when the light was a little different hoping to maybe see it. Which I did. Thankfully it was a real hot few days and it didnt deter me from getting in the water and battling the currents to actually believe it or not rescue my phone. that was still on and working, perfectly. Just an alert that said that moisture was detected in the charging port. Pretty mind blowing after being submerged for about 20 hrs in 15ft of fast moving water. Not to mention how great the camera is. And everything else."^5^July 17, 2018

I've only had it for a short time, The camera features are awesome, and I'm sure that I will eventually get a chance to play with them and learn how to use them. I do find the button placements to be difficult. Bixby button really gets in the way, Maybe it will become easier with time. My biggest gripe is the fingerprint unlock. It was hyped as a big plus when I bought the phone. Too bad that it only works 10% of the time despite keeping the button very clean and even reloading my fingerprint thinking it might help. I waste more time trying to use it then going back to the pattern method to unlock. Hopefully this will be improved some day."^5^June 17, 2018

DaddyDiesALot, ^415655858^15^7^"I have had the phone for three weeks. The first thing you will notice is that it is fast. The screen is excellent but I felt compelled to get a gel cover to protect the phone and still enjoy its blue color. Networking and Bluetooth are solid. Wireless charging is a great feature. Love the headphone jack, after all this is a phone not a bathtub toy. The phone's spam call detector is a nice addition. I love that I can actually store apps on the SD Card, amazingly, some other phones won't let you do this. Samsung Pay is fun to use. Logging on with a fingerprint is wonderful. My two complaints are these: First, the Bixby button is too close to the volume controls; especially when using any type of cover. I frequently have trouble distinguishing between the down volume and Bixby buttons. Second, I wish the phone was wider."^5^June 2, 2018

Lots of cool stuff that I've barely discovered yet. Things will always be somewhat different after a software update, people. What people are complaining about the icons now looking simple/childish is that it was designed for those who have visual impairments or aging eyes (like mine) in order to find things better. Google and Samsung are adding accessibility features so that more people who are elderly or who have disabilities can more easily use a mobile device."^5^April 16, 2019

space case, ^415655858^14^7^"The device should be called a full entertainment device. Everything appears super sharp and clear when watching movies in HD etc. I also got this because it is the only phone that plays DSD HD music as far as I know and I have a lot of DSD audio. I downloaded the Onkyo app and plays all DSD as well as FLAC files perfectly and seems to sound better than my Pioneer DSD player. So far I could not find one DSD music file it couldn't play. All video clear and in sync and the larger screen helps. The camera is sharp and good color and the special effects excellent. Of course, I think maybe the only phone that takes 400 gb sd card and they only cost about $112 and you need it if you are going to rip and play HD movies or HD audio and I put in 256 gb and it is already filled. You can get several apps that can support DSD straight or can convert but you don't want to convert it to a lower quality. With all the features that Apple doesn't have this is an extreme value. Because of all the high end features you may have to charge it sooner than you would and iphone with all its low end features. This phone is not inexpensive but superior value compared to anyone else I know of ."^5^November 2, 2018

I've had this phone for three months, I use it everyday and I'm still finding new features.

It has a good display, good camera, and it is pretty good in low light compared to the Galaxy S6. But there have been tons of reviews that I've seen about the battery being bad. And I honestly don't think the battery is that bad. The battery has a little bit of a tough time when you are constantly using bigger apps all day long. But I don't think anyone in the reviews had been comparing the battery to an S6 that has been used for 3 years. Yesterday I unplugged the phone at about 7:30 am and had been pretty much constantly on it all day. I plugged the phone in about 12:30 am and it was around 25%. So it has a hard time being used all day. But today I unplugged it around 10:30 am. It is about 10:30 pm now, so 12 hours, and the phone is at 80%. Today I have been on YouTube and a few other apps for a small amount of time. Other than that it has just been sitting around.

MasonVegas, ^415655858^9^3^"1)  They removed the button at the bottom to make the screen larger.  Sounds like a good feature, right?  But, you now have to scroll up to get an on-screen button, which often conflicts with the app underneath it.  So, while trying to get to the home screen or switch between apps, you're fighting the underlying app that thinks you're scrolling and clicking on it.  That is by far the worst feature."^1^February 18, 2019

I know Samsung probably doesn't want to deal with this with the past note problem but they would do well to maybe..discreetly fix the problem and give free exchanges."^2^June 6, 2018

MrEng, ^415655858^8^2^"I live in the U.S. but I was very fortunate to buy my S9+ in Singapore when it first came out on March 10, 2018. There are a couple of differences compared with the U.S. version. I got the 256gb version. U.S. is maxed at 64gb. Also it comes with a clear case protector(back only). Won't use it, but it nice that you have the option to use it. Why doesn't the U.S. have the 256gb version? This phone allows for 2 sim cards to be put in. With 256gb built in, you can use the 2nd slot for another sim card rather than extra storage.

GDenys, ^415655858^8^5^"I have always loved Samsung. When I switched my note7 for the pixel I said I wasn't going back to samsung. Then the s9 b came out and I just had to come back home. My only issue is that the touch screen is not sensitive enough. After maybe a week of having my phone it did a factory reset because when I was putting my pattern in to turn the phone on it was shorting my swiping and reset after 10 tries. I lost all of the puctures on my memory card. Other than that ine incident I love this phone. The camera is life I love the edge bcz it allows quick access to my most used apps bcz I only like to have one home screen with nothing in it. The sound is impeccable and so is the screen and color.

SongofSongs, ^415655858^7^3^"Everything would be fine if this was manufactured properly. The rear glass covering for the dual cameras is extremely fragile, that a slight breeze shatters it. Several people have already encountered this issue, some within just a few days of getting the phone. Samsung is not covering it under their standard warranty when it seems to be clearly a manufacturing flaw in the construction of the phone. It is very disappointing that Samsung is refusing to take responsibility for this and greatly diminishes trust in the integrity of their phones moving forward."^1^August 24, 2018

Ltngdrvr, ^415655858^7^2^"This phone is nothing short of amazing! It's my first top of the line premium phone, and I never knew, until now, what I'd been missing. It is blazing fast, the screen resolution is fantastic, and it can do so many things that I will be constantly discovering new functions. The dual speakers with the Dolby Atmos, sound so absolutely terrific, it's amazing that Samsung can pack so much sound into such small speakers. My last Samsung phone was a Galaxy Mega with the 6.3' screen, and I loved the huge screen on it, and that is my only lament about the S9+, it has a 6.2' screen, so you'd think it isn't that much smaller, but it is quite a bit smaller. Not length-wise, but smaller by a bunch height-wise, and I've missed that on every phone I've had since. That is the one thing that would make the S9+ absolutely perfect for me, a screen that big, but, I'll live without it in exchange for how great the rest of this phone is. I highly recommend this phone if you can possibly afford it, it's really outstanding."^5^July 21, 2018

WinnieC, ^415655858^7^4^"This is the worst phone I have ever had. I feel like I need to be a software developer to figure out how to use it; it is not user friendly at all and nothing is intuitive. It's hard to hold, the keyboard is hard to use, despite the fact that I just bought it, it NEVER seems to stop installing updates (which caused it to completely shut off last night, an awesome thing to have happen when you've set an alarm), it takes way worse pictures than the iPhone that I bought back in 2013. Also, Bixby absolutely sucks, I don't even want to use it but it pops up all the time because some genius at Samsung apparently decided to make a button for it that's right below the volume buttons. I'd take a flip phone over this, to be honest. I want my iPhone 5S back."^1^November 21, 2018

Heavy IT user, ^415655858^7^2^"As a long time HTC fan, when Verizon quit carrying the HTC brand (still don't understand why) I was forced to pick a new brand. So I went with S9+ as my wife has the note 8 with no problems. The Good- Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever had, just make sure you close all the open apps to save the life. Camera is ok, the note 8 takes far better pictures as far as color saturation, speakers are better than most phones and can actually be heard in stereo. The Bad- Worst user interface I have ever dealt with, far to many button pushes to get to things Example, push the phone call button, sometimes you get the recent screen, sometimes you get the contacts screen, and sometimes you get neither....if you want to actually dial a phone number, that's another button push. many of the basic features require 2 or 3 button pushes to get around. Very annoying and frustrating. The screen--..good bright and well defined picture, the touch sensitivity on the other hand is so far off with or without a screen protector ( which everyone uses on phones in todays age), sometime it wont react at all, sometimes it over reacts and deletes things that you didn't swipe on, other times it just react at all when trying to drag the top down or side in. The keyboard is virtually useless, granted I do have man fingers, but with the touch screen all over the place its hard to press the right characters ….then add in the predictive typing that changes your words so frequently that I had to become OCD and look at every word when typing otherwise it goes back and changes it, sometime it just throws all sorts of random characters in. if I had the option I would get rid of this phone in a heart beat and go pay full price for a HTC directly from the company. This phone is frustrating I am really starting to get away from using it at any chance I can.

Roge717, ^415655858^6^2^"No doubt about it I love this phone!

I dont like Apples animoji, but even that looks better hate to say. Software updates severely need improving especially with unlocked versions. Still not sure why Samsung refuses to let us repurpose the bixby button. If we pay top dollar for our device we should be able choose how we personally use our things. Bixby is way behind compared to google assistant. Theres still a long way to go if its ever considered useful.

Disappointed in Samsung a, ^415655858^6^2^"I don't usually write reviews. But this phone is not worth the money. There seem to be a lot of bugs in the software . Talk to text is constantly misunderstanding my words and putting capital letters in the strangest places. (Everywhere but the beginning of a sentence, hence my smartphone doesn't understand English). There are no physical buttons at the bottom of the phone to allow you to back out of or exit an app.  They are part of the software and they disappear in a lot of apps.  So you have to totally exit an app in the middle of what you are doing. Bixby shows up out of nowhere and interrupts phone calls.  As I write this review I can not access the end of the review bc I went back to add a comment.  So I will look like an idiot with an unfinished comment at the end.

I feel like Samsung should offer better camera technology like phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus (I already know they older DUAL pixel cameras). Also, I was hoping for this phone to record longer 4K 6FPS video instead of just 5 minutes and they also need to add 4K HDR Support for the Galaxy note9. I'll get the note9 if it's faster and if it has a better camera. Also, these phones need to be stronger and more durable, nothing happened to my Note8 and it got scratches on it.

I really don't know where to begin, this phones battery life, camera screen, durability, user friendliness everything about it is great. It was everything Samsung promised me without a doubt. The camera is beyond words it takes the best photos out of any phone on the market currently, in my opinion. I barely have to charge this thing and when I do happen to charge it, its very fast. When I first got the phone of course there was tutorials to show you whats new and how to use it, however it was not painfully long or painfully annoying all the tutorials were short simple and got straight to the point. Even my little friend Bixby is well put together and is very useful. Even the facial ID or fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone is beyond this world both very accurate and fast. I'll wrap it up by saying Samsung did everything right with this phone and hopefully some people switch from iphones to Samsung in the future for there own benefit."^5^March 21, 2018

DexterSmurf, ^415655858^5^1^"I had the s6 and loved it so I decided when it was time to update I would go with the s9+. My biggest complaint is the swipe texting. The dictionary is horrible!!! It puts in words that aren't even words or at least the not words in English for example it kept wanting to put in enkidu instead of English. I basically can't swipe text because it's too annoying and time consuming to swipe and correct constantly. Literally every word including words like we mess up. The battery life is ok for me but the location of the Bixby button is pain. The vibrate works when it wants to. I have issues with it wanting to connect or stay connected with a wifi signal.

Bixby was great entertainment and took excellent, fast screenshots. I assumed my phone would know the English language, it does not.

GeorgiaCajun, ^415655858^5^1^"I have only had this phone for 2 days, but so far, it is fantastic. I am most impressed with the life of the battery. On my old phone, Galaxy S5, I never kept location on because it drained my battery significantly. I also never would have GPS on if the phone wasn't plugged into my car charger. Yesterday, 3/15/2018, I decided to see how good this batter was. After all, I had it unplugged from the charger since 5:30 AM and it was only down to 73% batter left by 4 PM. I always had to charge my S5 by that point. Well, I used GPS on my way home with the phone not plugged in and by the time I got home, my battery was only down to 67% after an hour drive. When I plugged it in last night before bed, it was only at 49%. I have never had a smartphone with such a great battery. I have not really had the chance to play with the phone to really learn all of its features, but if the rest of the features are as good as the battery, I will be very ecstatic that I made this purchase. I will put further review in a month or so after I have really had time to learn this phone."^5^March 16, 2018

Also, my main problem is that the phone sometimes becomes soo soo slow, to the point where I have to turn it off. I really don't know why.

Grabel, ^415655858^4^0^"So far I really like this phone! I only found 3 things that I'm a little bummed about. Two of my favorite features were unfortunately not programmed. One being the ability to schedule a text message in the future (I use this constantly). The other being the ability to set individual notification tones for contacts (I also used this frequently). I was really hoping both of those features would still be available since they were on the s8. The only other thing that's just a little annoying is how fast the screen times out. I have set the screen repeatedly to not time out unt 3 minutes and it times out much quicker than that. This isn't a huge deal, just a tad annoying that's all. Overall I really enjoy this phone! It's much easier to text on and the camera is amazing. I just wish my favorite features were still available but that's the price you pay when you change phones.

I wish I had kept my S7 edge or at least my S8. The S9 is just the same phone with everything moved around. It is much harder to navigate, and some important features are gone or unusable. I used to enjoy being able to pick a different identifying alert for different people on text messages. GONE! The blue tooth is unusable with my BMW. It pairs but the audio is not comprehendible. The process for setting up notifications and alerts is much more complicated, and apps I have tried multiple times to turn off or disable continue to send notifications. It is loaded with annoying useless features. Worst of all, because so many people feel the same way, the phone is worthless. I can't even sell it.

Can't change the Bixby Button to do something useful...... the camera has a cheap lenscover that cracks and makes the camera useless. also I have found the software to be buggy, sometimes the sensor that shuts the screen off when you hold it up to your ear stays on after you finish a phone call so if you or your hand is near the sensor the screen goes black.

I also do not like the placement of the buttons, I tend to pinch the phone to press the volume or power buttons and I end up hitting both buttons. I appreciate the headphone jack, but it would be better on top, because when it is on the bottom, you cannot stand your phone up while headphones are plugged in.

Simplephoneuser, ^415655858^3^1^"I 'upgraded' my S7 active to an S9 and S9+ in November, 2018. Immediately, I noticed a number of downgrades on both phones: the camera is significantly poorer quality, the talk-to-text is untrainable, and doesn't come on or stay on in any consistent pattern, and even after 3 months is achieving a dismal 30% accuracy rate. Both phones are slower than the S7 was when new, and neither are as durable (which I expected). The pathway to get to certain features is much more convoluted due to the addition of too many unnecessary options like emoji's. I am very unhappy, and the constant updating is beyond annoying. I've had these phones for 3 months and they have gone through 4 major updates already, which - despite what they say - changes everything and deletes some contacts."^3^February 12, 2019

PeninaD, ^415655858^3^1^"Coming from almost a decade of all competitor Android mobiles...I find this S9+ to be powerful and speedy, and for the most part, Samsung has features that easily take the place of some specialty actions on my last two phones. "^5^April 14, 2018
camp1198, ^415655858^3^1^"My first samsung phone was the s5 and that is by far better than any galaxy released afterwards. Now I have the galaxy s9+. Here's what I'll say first. They need to quit with the edge. Its annoying, and pointless. Or should at least have a model with no edge.  Also for the 9 series they put the good 1.8 apeture camera only on the s9+ instead of both. So if you want that good camera you have to fork out another $100. Plus both phones crack easier now that they thrown the edge on their phones. They need to go back to how they at least built the s7. Another thing the camera seems a little bit beeter on my s5 compared to my s9+, the s5 had a 16MP camera. Now yes the s9+ supposedly has better sensors but still has a 12MP camera (they downgraded)."^3^November 29, 2018

hogtide, ^415655858^3^1^"It had been quite a few years since I bought a new cell phone. The camera on my last phone had started to degrade, especially in low light. The pics had a purplish hew. Each time I started to replace it, I'd see something better coming out a few months down the road and hold out. Finally it was time and I waited a little longer to pre-order the S9 plus. What a great decision. This phone is phenomenal. Sleek & stylish, but powerful and packed with features. My old phone did have great speakers and I had been disappointed in every other phone I had considered in that regard, but the S9 delivers! And the camera - WOW!

Copperfy, ^415655858^3^1^"I love the phone. 6GB RAM is one of the most basic requirement for a smooth experience on this OS. Unfortunately, they are removing Bixby Levels, which will likely make customers use Bixby even less. The phone looks and feels amazing, but don't drop it. Ever. Also get a dbrand skin on the back, otherwise your fingers will burn while playing a game and the back of the device will become the definition of fingerprints.

I've been using mine for deep sky imaging recently and so far the results have been excellent for being a mobile device. I would like to see ISO and exposure adjustments unlocked completely, ie, ISO maxes at 800 in the PRO mode but in auto, it will go beyond 1250. For exposures, you can set it to 10 seconds max, where I would like to see it go beyond 30 seconds maybe even out to a few minutes. Either way, it is still a phenomenal device."^5^March 1, 2019

Not only does this drop my calls but when I went into my carrier's store they indicated that this phone specifically has issues with merging calls. It's a known issue but it's not being worked on to be fixed? I understand that a lot of people use phones nowadays for faaar more than just using it as a phone, but I would hope that the phone company would want its main feature to actually be usable. If it was something that was at least being addressed I wouldn't mind so much, but apparently this is something that just keeps getting glossed over, and I find that frustrating as a user who just wants to use her phone the way it is intended to be used, as a phone."^2^November 30, 2018

The other thing is that my phone freezes frequently. I have to restart it to make it run fast again but sucks when I can't open apps or just suddenly slows down.

I am on my third sleeve and they all end a bit over where the screen protector starts so the push it up and while handling it actually becomes un-stuck.

LindsayDD, ^415655858^2^1^"I've now had the S9 Plus for a little over a week and I'm obsessed. I didn't want to review it right away and wanted to spend some time with it. I upgraded to it from the S7 Edge and it's so much nicer IMO. Other than the obvious changes screen size, no home button and the fingerprint scanner on the back it's much sleeker and faster than my old phone (I know it's still new) but it has all my apps, music, pics, videos, etc on it. So even with all that, there's a noticeable speed difference. I love the color. Lilac is something different compared to the usual gold, rose, silver, black, etc. I have a feeling it will be the most popular color option. It has 64GB plus a removable SD card slot which provides plenty of storage options. I believe I currently have a 32GB SD card in it same as my old phone but the S7 Edge only had 32GB to start. It didn't take me that long to get used to not having a physical home button. I like that there are so many lock options. You have of course the code/PW, as well as the fingerprint scanner, iris scanner, and the face scanner. Not to mention the fact that the camera is amazing, to say the least. Overall, I'm really loving it so far."^5^March 20, 2018

The camera truly is amazing, especially in low light settings. However, (and this is a major issue for me) the S7 'private' mode process for handling photos and videos that one wishes to hide from other eyes has been replaced by a 'secure folder' that is very cumbersome and does not provide the same level of security as the 'private' mode. TBH, had I known about this flawed change, I NEVER would have traded my S7 for the S9+. Yes, the other improvements are awesome!

I feel like the pictures are not that clear on my phone the are to blurry on low light. Also the bixby button and the Android updates that Samsung provides are annoying. Other than that the phone is fast and overall feels like a premium phone. I loved the s8+ and now got the s9+ for my girlfriend but I don't think I will be buying another Samsung device unless they fix this issues."^3^December 31, 2018
JustMe99999, ^415655858^1^1^"I have owned a Galaxy since the first one came out. LOVE THEM! Only thing that is disappointing with the S9 is Bixby and the button that you cannot reprogram. Samsung needs to realize that fans want versatility. Hope they don't become like Apple and start forcing us to use their stuff whether we like it or not. Had to remove the Bixby button from my case so I won't keep hitting it."^4^July 27, 2018

Iamitchelly, ^415655858^1^2^"I've been an avid user of all Samsung phones. I started from S3 to S8 and upgraded lately to the S9 plus. I'm very upset right now because my s9 phone won't open now, it got splashed with water when I was taking a video of my toddler swimming. The product claims that it is Water Resistant but now my phone won't open. Previously my  Galaxy S8  got dropped at the sink with water but after drying it, it worked again. I thought S9 plus would be better that's why I upgraded to this phone. My S9 didn't even got submerged in water but now it's not working.  So disappointed and sad."^1^July 10, 2019
RaiSag, ^415655858^1^7^"Overall an excellent phone. Responsive, fast, bright display and more. On the other hand, what is wrong with making S9 flat screen and S9+ edge like S7 and S7 edge, i really like the screen of S7 edge, hope they get rid of rounded corners and make both options a flat and an edge screen."^4^March 21, 2018

The battery life span even having all my apps open still lasts a 12 hour day. The Lilac color is specific just to this phone so far. It isn't too heavy and still fits in my pocket for its expanded size. Sleek rounded features keeps it modern yet functional. I recommend this phone."^5^June 1, 2018

WI Cherokee, ^415655858^0^4^"LCD on my S7 went out so upgraded to the new S9 a week ago. So are the only thing that I don't like is they changed the alarms to only one tone. On my S7 I could tell by the tone if I had and email, (which could wait) or a text from my wife that can't. This means I have to address the alarm every time. Had I known this I probably wouldn't have done a Samsung again, this is a real hassle. I think the engineer who came up with this idea should be fired!"^3^August 25, 2018

lilskibop, ^415655858^0^2^"Since the Oreo update I have not been able to use the screen mirror function on my phone. I use it daily to watch Hulu on my TV, as my PS4 doesn't play live content. Since the update, myself and many others that use this have had the feature interrupted minutes, or even seconds, into using it. Have tried everything, including speaking with Samsung reps. No answers or an update has been forthcoming. It's been months. Although I would recommend this phone, I would warn buying if you use this feature."^4^August 13, 2018

The new 9 does not allow you to assign ring tones to messages anymore. I find that very disappointing they would not have this feature anymore. Samsung needs to fix this problem ."^4^June 19, 2018
Ken M, ^415655858^0^1^"I switched from a Google Nexus phone to a Samsung 9 recently, and the biggest drawback is that I am now drowned with more SPAM calls than I ever received on the Google phone.  On top of that, I can't report a phone call as SPAM - I can block a phone number, but everyone knows that the spammers change phone numbers daily. I understand that Samsung discontinued the 'reporting as SPAM' feature with the Samsung 9 phone, whereas the prior models were participating in the program with Google.  So from a user perspective, although this phone sports fabulous features and software, the SPAM issue dampens my enthusiasm.  In addition, the auto-correct features are not on par with Google.  If Samsung will re-institute the 'report as SPAM' feature, I will give it a hearty 5-star rating."^2^January 24, 2019

For example: When you send someone a message and there is an option that show if the other person have read your message or not. This S9 doesn't have that feature.

This phone is super slow and now they had a big update that made it even worse. The new OS sucks and looks like a kids phone. I guess I'll have to find a different theme to use. I wish Samsung would go away from the useless curved screen."^1^February 9, 2019
JoanK, ^908470140^98^45^"Love my new iphone, no problems however, when I did purchase and started activation I got locked out by at&t, all I did was call their number online through ' attgophone' and talked with someone all I had to do was show them my proof of receipt I got through email 2 hours later It was unlocked.  IF you're looking to cut down on your phone bill, this is the BEST way to go. Everything my iphone 6 did, this does as well, for a small $40 monthly bill versus my $120 bill when I went through sprint on contract. Very happy with this phone, am buying 2 more for my mother and boyfriend.  I can have 3 lines for $120 where I used to pay $120 just for ONE LINE!"^5^November 10, 2017

^908470140^27^6^"This is one amazing smartphone. Simply amazing in everyway. I've had this phone for the past 2 months and it has held up and performs like new. I can easily achieve a consistent 4-7 hours of constant use on heavy tasks such as gaming, and media streaming. Of course, this all depends on the way you actually use the device. It takes an average of 2 hours and 30 minutes to charge from around 5% to 100% with the included 5W Apple wall adapter and lightning cable. The Apple custom designed A9 chip with the M9 motion coprocessor delivers astonishing performance as it's the same exact chip-set from the iPhone 6s & 6s Plus. And get this, the iPhone SE also outperforms those devices in benchmark scores thanks to the smaller lower resolution display which I don't mind. It's also paired with 2GB of RAM so multitasking and such is flawless. I can play AsphaltXtreme perfectly. And that's a very VERY demanding game. Social media such as Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Snapchat run flawlessly. iOS 11.1.1 (which is the latest current public version of iOS as of now) runs very well. Although it can be better, it's sufficient for my needs. We can all expect iOS 11 to be very much improved with iOS 11.2 in the near future. I come from budget Android devices and have been with them since late 2013, and I must say iOS is honestly much better and smoother than any Android device I've ever used. Even against a Galaxy S5. And here's what's literally unbelievable, the iPhone SE is selling for $129. Say whaaaaa??? Straight from Apple themselves unlocked it costs $350-$450. So as you can imagine this is an unbeatable deal. And the camera is a whole world of greatness. You can record full 4k @30FPS video. Although I prefer to record in 1080p @60 FPS as I like much smoother videos. Pictures are detailed and vibrant. It has excellent detailed low-light performance. The dual-flash on the rear is great. It delivers a balanced colored scene for your photos in low-light. All this is great and all except when you take a look at the FaceTime HD camera. It's a 1.2 megapixel sensor. So it won't blow your mind, but it's still very good and very much tolerable. At least for me. It's capable of recording 720p @30fps video so while it's not amazing it's good. There's also the Retina Flash. Which in low-light flashes the display 3 times brighter than usual to illuminate your selfies. The display is very colorful and vibrant. And very detailed with a PPI of 326. Which essentially means if you hold it far enough away from your eyes, you won't see any pixels. Even close up it looks great. Viewing angles are great. Nothing ground breaking just good as it is the same exact panel from the iPhone 5 and 5s. In fact they're literally interchangeable. Keep in mind that any and all cases/accessories from the 5 and 5s are supported on this device. Although, with some iPhone 5 cases they cover the home button, so those cases won't be able to be used with this device as you won't be able to use Touch ID with it. Speaking of Touch ID, it's good. Again, nothing amazing as it is the 1st Gen Touch ID. So it's fast and reliable, just not as much as the newest 2nd Gen model. Speaker quality is good. Quite loud and distinguishable. It's mono but it's still good. Call quality is great. The Simple Mobile service coverage is good in my area. The build quality is amazing. Crafted from bead-blasted aluminum, with matte chamfered edges, an inset stainless steel Apple logo, and an all around precision crafted build, you can and should expect nothing but amazement from this device. It's an absolutely beautiful smartphone. Sure the design as a whole is a bit dated and all but it's still classy and very much classic. It's also very light. Weighing in at 113 grams. It's quite small in my hand and it can very easily be used one handedly. You can also expect this device to last a long time as it should get software updates and will just be all around supported till around 2020ish. I do recommend a case to make this device last longer. Preferably a full body case such as an OtterBox Defender. Remember this is not a water-resistant smartphone. It's not indestructible. And it's not extremely durable. But it is the best thing for $129. So all in all, I totally recommend this smartphone. It's literally a steal at this price!"^5^November 11, 2017

However, when trying to activate the phone with my SIM card, it kept telling me the SIM was not supported. I called my carrier and they said a new SIM card would resolve the issue. I purchased a new SIM card and got the same message, it was not supported. I took the phone to my carrier's local agent and they tried three different SIM cards and were getting the same response. I was told to call Apple and they would be able to help me. I called Apple and after several minutes told me the phone was locked into AT&T and I would have to go to a store and have them unlock it. I drove to the nearest AT&T store (30 miles away) only to be told they couldn't do it at the store. They gave me the number for AT&T Customer Care and said they could unlock the phone for me. I drove the 30 miles back home and called. I was told to go to their website and request for the iPhone to be unlocked and the request could take up to 48 hours. I went to the website and put in the IMEI number and proceeded with my request to have the phone unlocked.

Jackie E, ^476014147^12^7^"I got excited that it was a brand new phone (when I got it in May 2017), however I've had nothing but bad luck with it. It does not like the Pages Manager app from Facebook, nor the Facebook app itself. I've so far had to restart the phone a couple times since I've had it because the apps I've mentioned have not been working properly and today it actually froze on the home screen and could not be restarted. A hard reset does nothing. Up until this point, everything else seemed to have worked on the phone, but it seems to be uncooperative in regards to working anything related to Facebook. The only way I got it to work was when I tried to go through a factory reset - it merely just rebooted the phone and now it seems to be working. I wonder how much longer before I have to restart the phone for any other issues... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^2^June 29, 2017

JacktheBear, ^476014147^4^0^"I bought this phone this week after using the LG V10 for the past year. It is a well designed smart phone.  It has what is needed to survive every day life of a travelling salesman and have a phone that will help me enjoy the weekends. I like that it is waterproof and shock resistant. The three buttons that were on the bottom of the screen on the V10 are now hard buttons on the bottom of the phone. This allows you to activate a glove mode so it is easier to navigate the phone with your gloves.  The Outdoor Essentials app is easily accessed with a single QuickButton on the side of the phone.  This app has a nice compass, barometer, step counter and exerciser recorder.  I would recommend this phone to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^5^June 3, 2017

After many trial and error issues I have learned to close all other apps which often but not always works.  The message 'Bluetooth is not responding - Close App' is very frustrating.

TrumpFan16, ^53126987^146^45^"I have owned this same phone now for many years. Its a great phone. As anyone would expect it does get a bit sluggish once it is filled with apps, and if you have multiple windows open, and multiple apps running. Thankfully this is easily solved by pressing the square button and selecting close all. After that it speeds up again. For 30 bucks you cant really beat this. The camera is pretty mediocre, but did a fine job when I went on a road trip without a good camera, even with photos of scenic mountains. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a basic phone. If youre someone who finds they are always breaking or dropping phones this is a great option. For 5 dollars they offer a plan that will replace it no matter what. Great deal!"^5^October 26, 2016
jenaveve, ^53126987^125^73^"Bought this phone for my 10 year old daughter for her birthday in August, it is her first phone. She only had 3 pics, 5 apps and a handful of contacts and the phone would constantly remind her that the storage space was running low, it says on the box you get up to 8GB of memory but you actually only get 4GB because of all the junk they have using up the memory and  you couldn't shut the reminder off, when she would try to go on any of her apps it wouldn't even let her on anything even though the space wasnt completely used up it was only running low, and then it froze up, i had to take it to an Att&T store to have it reset because i didn't know how to do it, and buying a SD card is only good if you want more pics on your phone, its no good for apps. So after the reset she could only put like 3 apps back onto the phone. Also I noticed in another review someone had problems answering phone calls,  we had that problem as well. When someone was calling you could tap, swipe, whatever and you could not answer the dang incoming call!! how frustrating!! So yea this phone isnt even good for a 10 year old!!

Dave, ^53126987^91^28^"My trusty old LG started to fail and I didn't have the resources to buy a spendy replacement. I found the Ideal and figured what could I lose for under $20.00?
I read all the reviews and still went for it, most complaints simply sounded like the user had no idea how to use it.
I was right, everything works great, but you will need to learn it by yourself, the included manual is a joke, but it has a built in app called 'Device help', I haven't opened it yet, but it might help some people.
I have only found two features missing that I use, one is that there is no built in option to block a phone number, so you may keep getting bogus calls, and number two is that you cannot stretch the screen in text messaging, I choose the largest font setting but it's still a little small for me.

NAMommy, ^53126987^17^5^"My Samsung phone died with a few months left on the contract. I purchased this little GoPhone and put my AT&T SIM card inside and began using it as my phone. If you choose to go this route, be aware that you will need to contact AT&T and provide proof of purchase and then they will activate the phone for you. I didn't know this and was initially frustrated because the phone didn't work but it was fine once activated.  It has most of the same features as a high end, high cost phone.  Obviously, it's missing a few features but I don't think you can expect more for the price!  The few downsides I noticed were you can only assign one ring tone and one alert tone as opposed to separate tones for each contact, it only has about 3 GB of actual storage because of all the preloaded apps and the OS needs BUT it does come with the capability of adding storage with an SD card.  And, it does not have the ability to block numbers but there is now an app for that. It is clearly modeled after the early generation iPhones but it isn't fooling anyone!  One caveat: be sure to install apps one at a time or transfer apps to the SD card one at a time to avoid issues with app use.  If your ability to install apps is compromised you will need to erase all apps and reset the phone. (Take it from me!)  Luckily, it did not cause me to lose my photos. Speaking of photos, the camera is simple to use and the photos are of decent quality. Again, maybe not the best but definitely better than I expected."^5^September 9, 2017

BBoo, ^53126987^5^2^"Not sure how this  phone is getting 5* reviews. Camera is garbage, but by far the worst problem is the battery. It can go maybe 1.5 hours if you are using it and takes OVER 7 hours to recharge, also you cant use it while it is charging because that uses up the battery life as well.

AT&T automatically suspended the phone a week after adding it and now requires that we send in an IMEI proof of purchase receipt.  Unfortunately, walmart.com doesn't include the IMEI number on their email receipt, so we don't have anything like that.  We now need to go back to the walmart at which we picked this up and get a receipt with the IMEI number on it.  Beyond inconvenient."^3^October 27, 2017

Picked up the phone and was provided a Straight Talk SIM card.  Could not activate it online.  Called the activation phone number and after 30 minutes of talking, was informed that the phone and SIM card are not compatible, and that I'd need a Bring Your Own Phone activation kit.  Drove to my neighborhood WalMart and was assured that the activation kit was what I needed.  Spent $60 on it, drove home and attempted to activate the phone, only to be advised that the phone itself (an unlocked iPhone, it turns out) is not compatible with the Straight Talk system.

Since I already had a Windows Laptop, Desktop and Tablet, now 'all' my devices sync seamlessly and work well 'together'. With .NET going open-source soon, the App-Gap will start to shrink. (Meaning, iPhone and Droid apps can be ported over to WinApps, very easily by developers. Without having to re-code it just for Windows.)

As a tutor for senior citizens up to the age of 94, this is the perfect phone for them. I've helped some use the iphone..it's a great phone, but way too confusing for some seniors.

I will not buy this phone because I heard a new one is coming out in Nov 2015 with a 20PM camera so will wait for that one.

Vince63, ^182794704^22^0^"I think this phone strikes a perfect balance for business and personal use.
Microsoft's commitment to continually innovate until they get it right has shown through on this device.
The 'fit and finish' is remarkable. It looks good, feels great and it works well.
and oh, btw... same experience across all my devices ...I absolutely love it"^5^August 7, 2015
BrianD, ^182794704^19^6^"My primary goal with this phone was to use it along side our Microsoft business programs, as well as stream music and general browsing. The outlook app is outstanding and the home screen layout is great, I enjoy using the News platform as well as the Weather and Finance. The Onenote app is good but limited ability to add tabs and how the series of tabs are displayed makes the use a little challenging, but easily adding photos is a huge plus. The look of the phone is great and the touch screen works well. The placement of the buttons is different from the Samsung phone but it doesn't take long to feel comfortable with the 735.

So the bad comes with the personal side of the phone, work is great but I need to be able to use my phone to play music and easily browse the internet. I use the Google play service and google does not have any portals for this phone so everything is web based. With the Samsung I could download songs once and play them without streaming. The other pitfall is Internet Explorer, I'm not sure who enjoys this browser but with the many features of Chrome, going back to internet explorer is not going to happen.

Overall I was excited to get this phone but after having no google apps I'm not sure how I can efficiently transfer everything over. The windows functionality is really good, but for me to adapt to this OS I need acres to apps I currently use."^3^September 25, 2015

zemes, ^182794704^17^1^"It's a delight to see how beautiful this phone is. But also almost sad for the lack of popularity of Windows phone, as measured against iPhones. It's hard to believe that this phone is sold for less than USD200, while the iPhone are sold for USD650 and above. In terms of the design and aesthetics this is every bit as good as iPhones. And in terms of durability and anti-damage, this is far superior to iPhones. The only problem is that it lacks some useful apps, which is a shortcoming of the operating system. If you could live with the app ecosystem of Windows phone, this phone is a steal. Far better than the Lumia 625, and even better than the older but much more expensive Lumia 925."^5^September 11, 2015

There were minor scratches, I don't mind that because I put a nice case over my phones anyways, but blown speakers are a deal breaker for me.

Went to the apple store to find out what was wrong with it and they couldnt figure it out and told me to come back after i made an appointment with the genius bar. Came back to the apple store a later day to find out it was a sprint phone and was told i should take it to sprint to get it unlocked. Drove to sprint to unlock it where they told me its not a sprint phone and it does not show up in their system and its an at&t phone. Sprint then told me i need to take it back to walmart to figure out what was wrong.

Studiomac, ^50132328^40^13^"Here are the concrete facts about the 'iPhone 6S 64GB refurbished' that I received, ordered from this very page:

1. The outside sticker (and paper receipt in the box) has a gray/blue sticker on the outside shrink wrap that reads 'Apple iPhone 6s 64GB Space Gray LTE Cellular AT&T MKRG2LL/A'.

2. Once opened and inserting my carrier's SIM card to activate and setup the phone (in this case, Ting), the setup stops at the a screen that says, 'SIM card invalid'

3. After speaking with both Ting and AT&T, and providing both with the phone's IMEI number, it was discovered that the phone is LOCKED - AND - per AT&T's online Device Unlock Portal webpage - is currently active on another AT&T customer's account!

4. WAIT - THERE'S MORE! inside the box, there is a double sided printed business card that has information regarding the phone's 90 day warranty policy. This is handled by 'Recon Group, Inc'. It states if the product doesn't function, etc... please complete the Warranty submission form located at 'www.The ReconGroup.com/Warranty'. Submitting the IMEI number, the site comes back with 'We are sorry to inform you that this unit does not qualify for the warranty program because this units serial # or recon ID or IMEI is not registered in our database. Please contact the product manufacturer for further assistance.'

Those are the cold facts on this phone, folks.

So to sum up - the phone I got is locked to AT&T and they will not unlock it - EVEN IF YOU WERE TO PUT THIS PHONE ON AT&T'S SERVICE. ALSO - the warranty company doesn't have the phone's IMEI on file and won't provide warranty service.

Per AT&T customer service: 'Unfortunately, your unlock request was denied because:Your device is currently active on another AT&T customer's account. '

BUYER BEWARE

Would give it -5 stars if I could.

3gh1, ^50132328^28^2^"phone arrived initially locked to AT&T so it wouldn't recognize my t-mobile sim. i was ready to return it but thought of trying AT&T website to see if they have online unlocking procedure and they do, even for non at&t customers. so i followed the procedure which is very simple and self explanatory and got an email with instruction to confirm the request within 24 hours. i confirmed it right away and approx 5 minutes later another email came in approving the request with instruction on how to go about the unlocking which is as simple as just inserting your sim card. anyway, i was not expecting it would turn out this way because it's similar to the previous review except that mine has a better ending :)

4 stars overall because it's not readily unlocked. others would have simply returned it like my initial reaction.

5 stars for the phone. it's practically brand new with chargers and headset in seemingly unused condition. upon checking with apple warranty, it has 6 months left.

Shawnsterthemonster, ^50132328^28^1^"Basically, if you're going to buy one of these refurbished iPhones from Walmart.com, make sure it is SOLD AND SHIPPED by Walmart.com. Pay attention to where it's coming from. You won't be sorry (unless you purchase from a third party on Walmart.com). The 5 Stars are for a phone sold and shipped by Walmart. 

Here's my story:

Two years ago, I bought a refurbished iPhone 5S from Walmart.com. It arrived in mint condition, in an Apple box, with Apple accessories. Other than the slightly scuffed an smudged iPhone box, the phone was utterly flawless. Had I not known myself that I had purchased a refurbished phone, I would have thought it came straight from the Apple store brand new. It had a little note in the shipping box stating that it had been reconditioned and refurbished by 'The Recon Group.' I was very impressed, so you can imagine why I came back to Walmart.com to look for another refurbished iPhone after my iPhone 5S was wearing out after two years of use. 

Thinking that all refurbished iPhones listed on Walmart.com would be the same type of experience, I found the iPhone 6S I wanted and purchased with confidence. What I missed was that it was SOLD AND SHIPPED by JemJem.com--NOT Walmart.com. The phone arrived quickly, but the experience paled in comparison to my first experience with a refurbished phone purchased on Walmart.com. The JemJem refurbished phone arrived in a lackluster box. It had a cheap aftermarket charger, no earbuds, no manuals or documentation, and the phone itself looked like a used item. I was incredibly disappointed and decided to return the item to JemJem.

Wondering where I went wrong, I went back and looked at my iPhone 5S purchase history from two years ago. THAT phone was SOLD AND SHIPPED by Walmart.com (not JemJem or any other third party seller). 

I decided to try again and see if I could get an iPhone 6S that had been reconditioned and refurbished by 'The Recon Group', just like the initial 5S I had for two years. I was careful to choose a color and storage option that resulted in the phone being 'Sold & Shipped' by Walmart, as seen in the screenshot with this review. I purchased it (at a lower price than the JemJem one, actually) and waited with anticipation to see if it would be as delightful of an experience as I was hoping for. The phone arrived, and it was PERFECT. It came with a note saying it was reconditioned by 'The Recon Group,' it had all Apple accessories, and the experience was as delightful as my intitial experience with the iPhone 5S two years ago. I'm absolutely thrilled with the second try at a great refurbished iPhone 6S. 

Seems like the stock of those sold and shipped by Walmart come and go, so if you can't find one one day then try again on another day. Watch it. Be patient. You'll be happy with your purchase."^5^March 3, 2017
SILVIA, ^50132328^27^19^"The iphone is locked to Sprint. Does not work on AT&T and other carriers.
I will go to the store tomorrow to return the item.
When i tryed to unlock it, AT&T Said: 'We're unable to approve your request because the IMEI number provided doesn't match a device that's currently on the AT&T network.'"^1^May 4, 2016
davdav, ^50132328^24^1^"I've gone through a few refurbished supposedly unlocked phones. Sometimes they can't be unlocked if still under someone else's delinquent account.
Just return for refund under Walmart policy and purchase another.
Try unlocking online with ATT or make a couple phone calls to carriers to request unlocking. If they cannot then promptly return the phone.
DO NOT WASTE TIME RUNNING AROUND FOR HELP LIKE the reviewer that kept the phone as a paper weight. Yes it's annoying and time consuming but if the Walmart price is significantly less than new from Apple (last year iPhone 6 was only150 less than new from Apple Store) then it's worth it , especially the Walmart protection plan is cheaper than Apple care, and have used that plan with great results, which is the major reason I try to buy from Walmart."^4^April 29, 2016

The phone was locked to AT&T when it arrived on 10/27.  Simply go to the AT&T website and submit a request to unlock the phone.  My phone was unlocked within a few minutes.  Then insert the Sim Card & call StraightTalk to get it activated.  Easy process.

Adam, ^50132328^11^0^"After finding this deal that claims to save you hundreds of dollars on an iPhone 6s, I thought it sounded too good to be true. The package came quickly and was shrink-wrapped in what stated was an AT&T locked phone, which is what I was expecting to receive. After inserting my AT&T sim card, my carrier was unsupported and it couldn't activate. The phone ended up being locked by Sprint, which has an almost impossible unlocking policy. I considered using a third party to unlock it for me, but additional money would have to be paid. 

Next I noticed the box comes with a small card describing the warranty of the phone. I checked this online and as other reviewers have shared, the site claims the phones are not registered and covered. Lastly, I called the number of SaveTronix, the listed supplier of the product, and the line was disconnected. At that point, I gave up and returned it to my local Walmart for a refund. The cashier even noticed the phone didn't have all of the serial number printed on the back. All of this made me wonder if it's a scam.

Bottom line, this is a game since some have received the correct model while others like me had a product mix-up. Seems like a waste of time and a lot of extra effort to try to save money. Will not be purchasing a phone from Walmart in the future."^1^June 24, 2016

Benidorm, ^50132328^1^0^"Description stated that this is an AT&T phone. Item arrived early. However, when I went to AT&T store for a new SIM the phone did not connect to AT&T network. AT&T rep said this is due to not being an AT&T phone. Others expressed various experiences. I bought device because of Walmart being a brick and mortar and excellent customer service. I am disappointed in Walmart for selling a not as advertised item. I know they are trying to grow their online presence, but this is not the way to do it. I am not sure their supplier, but someone needs to quality control this. Item not as promised."^1^May 21, 2016

NK24, ^50132328^1^0^"Seemingly new, shrink wrapped in original box. I got the A1633 (AT&T) version -- this is only important if you're planning on using it on AT&T, and even then maybe not that important. Had no problem popping in my existing (iphone 5) AT&T sim card and taking off with this 6s.

A card inside the box explicitly states 'The limited, 90-day warranty covering your refurbished product is being provided to you solely by The Recon Group, Inc. and not Walmart.com or the original product manufacturer.' FWIW, inputting my serial number on Apple's web site yields a page saying I've got phone support through May 16, 2016 and repair coverage through February 15, 2017. So it's a little unclear which one is accurate, but here's hoping I never have to find out.

Overall pleased in my first day of ownership, but docking one star for the lack of clarity from Walmart on the warranty."^4^April 30, 2016

I am not sure if the phone is unlocked or not but I wanted this for AT&T service and had no issues activating or using the iPhone.  The iPhone arrived in what looked like almost brand new condition, no scratches or nicks or dents etc.  Screen was perfect.

This is my second refurbished iPhone Walmart purchase and I am still just as impressed.  Can't beat the price and still has original Apple Care Warranty through 2017!

I received the refurbished phone, but it is useless as it was not cleaned up.
I am not able to use it as it contains icloud account, and phone is useless.
Why the phone was sent to me without proper cleanup of data?

I am totally dissatisfied, it has wasted many hours for me.
I also contacted Apple Support case ID: 100159095346

They said seller Atomic/Walmart must fix issue.

I was hoping a clean phone refurbished with no issues, but I wasted time and got really
frustrated.

It asks the old password even to cleanup. Apple said that is security so if someone looses phone
it cannt be used by others.

How can you sell the phones with old customer data ( infraction of privacy )?
Where do you obtain phones that have old data and are not cleaned up properly?

I am really frustrated and dont know where to report this issue.

Thanks

123Shop, ^43241911^48^8^"I do work for walmart (get that out of the way) but I'm also the biggest critic when it comes to the business and the product - especially wireless! I just bought two refurbished Verizon iPhones as gifts and one was this iPhone 5s 16GB and the other was a 6 64GB. According to the site both were locked to Verizon. I expected a good experience but even I was surprised that both phones were indistinguishable from new. The box was factory new, shrink wrapped, and came with all the original accessories - even the screen came protected with a film. And even better both Phones were UNLOCKED!!! That means it will work with most any carrier (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, any world wide GSM service that uses a SIM card, but I'm not sure about Sprint). I took out my T-Mobile SIM from my iPhone 6 Plus and inserted it into each phone and powered them on and both instantly recognized the service and was working! The phones work perfectly (and I am a power user), no scratches, blemishes, dings, or dents. I am very happy that we offer these and will be back for more! I have uploaded images so you can see but we only allow 2 images at 1.5mb max so I had to group them. If you are considering getting one of these refurb iPhones - go for it! I know you will be happy with it."^5^November 18, 2015

It's thinner and lighter than my old phone and I like the ability to use a fingerprint vs. a four-digit code to access all of its features. I was unaware that the '5S' required a SIM card to be activated on the Verizon network which I purchased after the fact but I received an account credit that almost matched the cost of the card. The condition of the iPhone 5S was 'like new' and there were no problems inserting the SIM card, setting up the phone and activating it with Verizon. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. I also liked the option to have it delivered to my local Walmart store for pickup."^5^May 21, 2015

Swannie, ^43241911^10^1^"We bought two refurbished iPhones through Walmart and I'm extremely dissatisfied with the vendor (Smart Mobile) they used to fulfill the order.

First, the phones came with Android chargers instead of iPhone chargers. These chargers were obviously incompatible with the phones and I don't know why they were included.

Second, we went to Verizon to activate the two phones and one of the phones did not work with the carrier as advertised (perhaps the phone was stolen?). So it's essentially useless. I tried calling and emailing the vendor but received no response.

Between sending incompatible chargers with the iPhones and sending a phone that was falsely advertised as working with Verizon, I am surprised Smart Mobile is able to partner with a largely reputable company like Walmart.

I will never purchase a phone from them again. Buyer beware."^1^January 4, 2017

They could not get the phone out of contract with Verizon and told me to return the phone and order a replacement. This was going to be a Christmas gift for me daughter and I needed it by December 24. Given the time crunch, I drove 30 minutes to the nearest Walmart. Thankfully, Walmart gave me a full refund.

Immediately upon use she discovered the screen was difficult to use. After 3 days she took it to our local Apple Store who determined the phone had a hardware problem and was not considered to be a certified refurbished phone. AT this point I decided to contact the company. They are more than willing to accept a return with a 20% restocking fee and without paying for return shipping and will refund her money (less the 20%) if they determine the phone is indeed defective and they they believe it is not her fault (which will take time- as in weeks).

The phone was purchased because it was unlocked, but the phone can not be activated with my current carrier due to a defect with the phone.

Weavis55, ^49053770^30^5^"This phone would only charge to 64% and would turn off within five minutes of use.  This company states that all of there products go through a 'tough' testing process which is obviously not true.  The phone was also scratched with small dent throughout.  Would definitely not recommend"^1^April 3, 2017

Kristy, ^49053770^19^5^"My daughter purchased a 'certified refurbished' I Phone through this company. We called the Verizon Store who determined the phone had a hardware problem and was not considered to be a certified refurbished phone. AT this point I decided to contact the company.  They are more than willing to accept a return and never mentioned a 20% restocking fee plus we had to pay the shipping back.  They claim the unit was reevaluated and that we found it to be functional therefore they stand firm in their decision regarding the restocking fee.  Poor customer service and I have also reported them to Wal-Mart!"^1^July 12, 2017

RyanC, ^49053770^17^5^"Very bad online shopping experience. Would never recommend anything from Quick Wireless EVER. Bottom line is the 'Refurbished Apple iPhone 5s 16 GB Smartphone (Unlocked)' phone didn't work with my carrier -- Cricket. They charged insisted on charging me a 20% of item total restocking fee as well.

Here are my notes (with dates) that I kept to keep track of this lengthy, annoying, and costly process:

6/1 Ordered the iPhone 5s 16 GB unlocked gray smartphone via Walmart.com for $99.99 (plus tax) 
6/5 Phone delivered and turns on, but doesn't work on my network. The lady at the Cricket wireless store said she'd seen several phones ordered via walmart.com that wouldn't work as claimed.
6/7 Called Quick Wireless directly and spoke with woman who said they can only refund, not exchange items. She went on to say to avoid a 20% restocking fee, I need to write a note saying phone did not work on network is being returned. Said she would immediately send two emails:
     1) Instructions to send back phone
     2) Shipping label
I did not receive any emails.
6/8 Messaged Quick Wireless via Walmart.com requesting those emails. I promptly received those emails and an additional email from Quick Wireless justifying themselves saying they did indeed send the previous emails.
6/13 Mailed iPhone back to Quick Wireless with note inside about not working
6/15 Phone delivered to Quick Wireless per USPS tracking website
6/17 Refund of $79.99 applied
6/19 Contacted Quick Wireless via Walmart.com asking remaining amount be refunded as well. They replied saying they have submitted my dispute against the restocking fee.
6/20 Received an email back saying 'The unit was reevaluated and that we found it to be functional therefore we stand firm in our decision regarding the restocking fee.
'

Buyer beware! I should've listened to the other reviews and the overall low score. I don't know why Walmart doesn't scrutinize their vendors more thoroughly or can any yahoo sell some merchandise they have?

Very disappointed."^1^June 21, 2017

Oskr, ^49053770^15^3^"I bought 2 IPhones and these are NOT Refurbished these are highly used, broken, trashy IPhones, both has lose buttons, which means a poor repair, pixel screen damaged, and one is stuck in headphones.

Pay a little more and get an apple certified refurbished, you will just loose time dealing with the return and refund."^1^April 21, 2017
