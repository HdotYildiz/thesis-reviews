Hannah8610, ^519481595^14^12^"I bought the white Xbox One S with GoW4 because it was 1 TB memory, and I needed a headset to chat with. I don't know what people are talking about needing an adapter for, because it plugs into your controller's 3.5 mm jack. It says in the description that it is a CHAT headset, not like a Turtle Beach where you can hear game sounds No, you do not hear game sounds through this headset. It does what I needed it to, which is be able to party chat with a friend of mine. I love the mic switch off slider-thingy and volume control on the cord. The slider for the mic is red when your mic is muted. My only complaint is not about the headset as much as it is the fact that I have a tiny head, so this fits bigger than my drive-thru headset at work lol"^5^April 4, 2017

Kyle, ^519481595^4^12^"Don't listen to one of the previous review that it needs an adaptor, it doesn't. It plugs into the jack on the rear of the XBox One controler. I had to go into the headset settings on the XBox console to adjust the starting volume. Then I was able to control it fine on the headset's volume control. Good chat set for the price."^5^April 9, 2017
dsplena, ^519481595^2^4^"i bought this headset earlier this year and so far it's worked alright. there were times where it would start to static or a point where my friends online wouldn't hear me talk which is a bit annoying. later on the mic does start to make random noises and does echo if you don't fix your mic settings. the mic is good for a couple of months but ends up being useless later on. i recommend looking into another mic instead of this one."^3^October 8, 2017

Blackrifleguy, ^24273958^3^1^"Ghosts has really great graphics if you have the hardware that's needed to run it.
Multiplayer is a lot of fun, first on the trigger normally gets the kill, and the in game movement was meant to be that of weighted down with gear soldiers movement.
I had no lag during my online play, I got into different games just fine.
I am very happy with the game."^5^November 6, 2013

TiredofUpgrading, ^24273958^3^1^"I have had game for two weeks and have not been able to play it yet. Game wont install. Activision has no customer support email , they have a chat that no one has answered yet, they have Facebook that they don't answer, and a Twitter account that they answered once and didn't answer follow up responses. Found many other websites that have people who have had the same complaint about access to their customer service. Game is most likely great and my difficulties rare but the customer support is inexcusable. Buyer beware."^1^February 5, 2014

codex313, ^37789148^7^40^"rockstar has released this game as a platform based game at start which means they allowed players to use mods. This means rockstar enabled players to manipulate game files allowing griefers and certain mods to be harmful not only too your credit cards personal info and may harm your graphics card with overclocking mods. missions are glitched due to modders rockstar says they been working to solve this but its getting worse so far the only solution put into action is rockstar request you to report every modder by opening a ticket. spend 2 hours trying to play the game but only complete 1-3 missions. mostly loading and reloging due too these griefers. as far as the story mode gameplay it is perfect but dont be too excited if you want to play online with your friends or other players. This game is not refundable after you use your activation code I found it to be a waste of money as do most players this is why gta v online price keeps droping cheaper and cheaper."^1^December 3, 2016

RegrettingPurchase1, ^20532210^56^38^"I was able to log in to the game when I first installed the game without any issues. I had to run an errand and when I tried to log into the game I was put into a que. I have been que'ing for hours.

I went to the forums and I am not the only one that has wasted hours waiting to log in and play the game.

This is possibly related to the game being new and EA not being prepared for the load so if you have not purchased the game yet I would hold off on purchasing the game until they get this situated. If not you, you can play the que game with the rest of us.

You must have an internet connection to play this game."^1^March 5, 2013
cupcakezz, ^20532210^45^30^"I give this 4/5 stars. As much as I love Sim City games, this one has to be the best I've seen in a long, long time. The people here giving it a 1/5 stars are too biased at the fact that this game is new and requires an internet connection. No one, not even EA could foresee how well the game would actually sell, thus giving it some problems on launch. But as far as actual game play goes, mind blowing! Now, I agree that the whole DRM part factors into the rating, which is pretty much the only reason why I gave this a 4/5 instead of 5/5... As far as the business end goes, EA definitely did the right thing with DRM, even though it is an inconvenience to some.

All in all- Game play, 5/5; DRM and online issues 3/5 ( But you must realize this will not be an issue for ever. I'm sure EA is fixing it, or even has fixed it already by the time you read this review)

Final verdict: Amazing game to play and watch. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone who wants to try out a Sim City game, or even to those long time veterans."^4^March 10, 2013
FlyinBryin89, ^20532210^35^14^"At the beginning of the release, trying to play was terrible with all the server overloads. The game itself is fantastic and very addicting. Ive played for a couple days straight now and havent had any problems playing on the servers. EA has done multiple fixes with the servers including adding a ton more to take the load off the rest of the servers. The game is worth buying 'now'. Dont let the bad reviews steer you away from a great game with great potential. Ive logged 20 hours in a week playing this."^4^March 11, 2013
DeadlyJoaquin, ^20532210^32^22^"The game itself is great. But what is killing it is the DRM always connected forced feature. I was able to play it for a while on launch day. But now I can't play at all because of the ineptitude of EA deciding to save my gameplay on a server instead of on my hard drive and all servers being down. I just hope that my investment can be rewarded later on when they finally fix the servers."^1^March 6, 2013
Livewire90210, ^20532210^21^17^"But since the EA SimCity servers are overloaded, you'll never actually get to play. I've owned the game for 48hours, and have had less than 1 hour of playable time. During that hour I was also repeatedly disconnected and unable to play for longer than 5 minutes - this game is an absolute waste of the disc it was printed on, an abhorrent time sink for updates and attempting to actually login, and a disgrace to video gaming in general.

If you don't believe me, go take a peek at EA's 'Answer HQ' for the game - no answers, only questions regarding when exactly the servers will be playable. EA is supposedly working to resolve the problem, however there is no time-frame, and they've already been flat out wrong and indicated the servers were up when they were, in fact, down for emergency maintenance.

Don't waste your time and money. Get SimCity 4 if you're that desperate for a good SimCity game - that one doesn't require EA to have their servers in working order."^1^March 7, 2013
gamergirl4life, ^20532210^20^2^"If I would have given a review days after buying this game it most likely would have been poor. As a huge MMO gamer, server issues was something I deal with often. After EA finally got it together and we were all able to play. My review is 5 stars. There is so much to do, hours and hours of game time. The online aspect is great. Maybe later we will get added content. It is online but you dont have to play with others, you can block people from joining. If you loved the past Simcity games. You will love this one!!!"^5^March 16, 2013
Beemerw, ^20532210^20^18^"EA was not prepared for this game, they have a mandatory online mode that can't be turned off, and their servers are over run, so you cant even get on to play ..... save your money until this problem is fixed!!! So far it has been a flop and a huge disappointment."^1^March 7, 2013
smilehere26, ^20532210^16^2^"Everyone: Remember when a new game first comes out there's always glitches. I bought the game on 5/8/13 and haven't stopped playing. When I first put the disc in my PC, logged onto Origin (which I can't stand but you have to use it in order to play) there were many updates that had to be downloaded. I haven't been kicked off a server yet and have enjoyed hours and hours of game play. My PC is about 4 years old and plays the game well and the graphics are ok but if I had a newer computer I'm sure it would look even better. To any of you who are on the fence about buying the game: I say buy it. It seems EA has been updating the game on a regular basis and it has been out for two months now. Thanks for reading my review!"^5^May 13, 2013
Cera, ^20532210^11^0^"A very good game, and somewhat addicting if I may say so.
Only issue I have is the servers. I get kicked out quite often due to a loss of connection. Once they get that fixed it will be a very good game."^4^March 12, 2013
usernameneeded, ^20532210^10^10^"This game has DRM (Digital Rights Management) that requires you to always be logged onto EA's (EA being the publisher of this video game) online servers. The biggest problem here is that huge numbers of people who purchased this game are unable to log on because the servers that are available to play on are unable to accommodate all the people trying to play. Those that do manage to log on, loose connection almost immediately after booting the game up. This game at the moment is as far as I am concerned, is broken and would advise anyone who might to be interested in buying to stay away from this title until at least the problems w/ it have been addressed."^1^March 8, 2013
DisappointedCitizen, ^20532210^9^6^"This game must be played on-line,if your internet connection fails this game cannot be played,origin servers are constantly down or experiencing problems,crashes just as much if not more than SimCity4,and each time I've been brought back to the tutorial,5x so far."^1^March 9, 2013
Jabuds, ^20532210^8^3^"This game is by far fun to play. Maxis did a great job with the game. Although the servers are down a lot, once you are in the game and playing the down servers have no affect on you. This game is a 5/5 no doubt, but that potential is kind of shot since you have to be connected to the internet even when you are just playing single player. Game's still a little bit buggy as well, but for the 3 days I have had this game I have been extremely impressed and have to force myself to get off and get some sleep."^4^March 10, 2013
GermanFries, ^20532210^7^5^"I purchased this game at my local Walmart on the day of release, March 5th. I have only been able to play about 8 hours worth of the game. Mostly due to updates and being knocked off their servers. And when I am able to play, the gameplay is extremely slow......Save your money for another game........No offline play what so ever.....Going back to playing SimCity4. 10 years have passed since this one was released and the new version goes back in time.. They have even turned of some functionality of this game. I paid full price how come I don't get a full game?"^1^March 9, 2013
JimMNH, ^20532210^7^6^"Thousands are reporting these connectivity issues in forums everywhere. Game requires you connect to their servers for single player; even tutorial. With the servers offline or in a constant state of patching over the past two days few are able to connect. And those that are able cannot join a game or create their own single player map which also requires connectivity to a server to 'save your game to their cloud'. Game is overpriced to begin with but this is brutal as it makes that overpriced game unplayable .. even unlaunchable. As a fan and owner of every version since classic b&w this is a terrible failure for EA/Maxis. They started offering refunds and then backpedaled on this too. THIS is a prime example of why PC gamers feel that Steam rules and Origin su__s .. just in case you're still missing the point."^1^March 9, 2013
GamerAda, ^20532210^7^7^"I've had this game for just shy of a week now and I've only been able to play it for about thirty minutes in total. It is a single-player game that *requires* a constant Internet connection. Their servers have been failing constantly and I'm often not able to get a connection. When I do, there's a wait queue that I've spent up to an hour in. Who wants to play a game where you have to start it up and then wait for an hour to start playing? Not me. I'm finished with SimCity and I'm finished with EA after this debacle. What a waste of money."^1^March 9, 2013
Zamaza, ^20532210^7^7^"The SimCity launch has been plagued with server stability issues. Now that many of those issues are being resolved and people are getting into play, a plethora of game breaking bugs are showing up, making cities unplayable. It's also possible for your city or region files to get corrupted and continuously get a 'Cannot load this city at this time. Please try again' message loop, losing hours of progress permanently.

The multiplayer, one of the 'key elements' of this game is buggy. Sending and sharing resources and vehicles with friends is delayed 5 minutes to an hour. Sometimes, money or resources sent are never received, but are still deducted from the player sending them.

SimCity has some good elements and a lot of the gameplay is fun, until it bugs out, which seems to happen to everyone. Save your money. Wait until the game drops in price and the issues are fixed."^1^March 13, 2013
AntwanIsAwesome, ^20532210^7^3^"I play SimCity on an average of 5 hours a day. It's a great way to break the time for me because its summer break and i play the iOS app; Clash of clans, Which is a game where you wait for buildings to upgrade which takes real time. So while im playing SimCity, time is going by quickly. I think the game helps you learn more about what goes on in your city and cities worldwide that you didn't know and the game really gives you a feel of what controlling a city is like and all the problems you face as a mayor."^5^July 16, 2013

walmartshopper25923, ^20532210^4^5^"I would give this game a zero or negative rating if I could. It made me register my email address online and it made me give myself an 'identity' so that others would 'know' who I was.

When I bought it, I thought I was buying a game that the kids would play offline after it was installed. That does not appear to be the case. If you don't want your kids exposed to or playing with strangers on the internet you probably do not want to buy this product. The kids like to play computer games sometimes while I'm working. Due to my computer needs for work, they cannot be on the internet while I'm working therefore this game is useless until I'm done working for the day. After spending $60 for this game, I am very, very angry."^1^March 17, 2013
MomsLilTwins, ^20532210^4^2^"I really think the game is a lot of fun and it has a ton of new concepts. If you liked sim city 2000, you would really enjoy this game. The graphics are great, the concept is real, and if it weren't for the server issues, I would have given it 5 stars."^4^March 19, 2013
WolfyZ, ^20532210^4^1^"Simcity was a game that I held high hopes for, only to be let down quickly when I actually was able to play it.
The Always online was an annoyance, one that looking back should have steered me away from the game all together. Game maker Maxis, and EA assured us that was because calcualtions performed in the background required the server itself to do the heavy lifting. This was later admmited to be false, as well as proven by the gamming community. Now they say that they had to make it online, because it was their vision to do so. What about your customers visions of what a franchise was, and should be?
Aside from the horrible Online aspect, the game itself has glaring flaws. (though Maxis is trying to work to improve them.)
First and foremost is traffic issues, the sims will always take the shortest path from point A to B, even if that path is a two lane dirt road. Secondly, the sims always start the day unemployed, and fill in jobs starting with the closest to them. This too causes traffic congestion with every sim in the game going for one open job till it's full, then onto the next closest.
Fire trucks and other emergency vehicles spend all their time in traffic, almost making their addition in your city pointless.
I am sure within a few months, all these points will be addressed and likely fixed. That doesn't take away from the fact that the game shipped out on day one, was unplayable, and as of this writing still is if you have any serious intentions to make a working city when playing."^2^March 19, 2013

Heatherrules09, ^20532210^1^1^"Awesome game. I love the gameplay, love the graphics, and love how more flexible it is in some areas. However, I wish it was more flexible like Simcity 4. I always loved being able to create my own landscapes, choose the size of the city, and actually have the game work the majority of the time. I love in a rural area where fast internet isn't always available so it is very disappointing that I can't enjoy my game because of it being terribly slow or not working.
I played the demo of this game and absolutely loved it. However, when I bought the game (I preordered it) I found so many things that I didn't like. It doesn't seem completely user-friendly, I've had a hard time figuring out all the options and extras, but it does have a lot of cool features that really put you 'in your city'. However, it's frustrating to play it, at least for me, so I never do play it"^3^April 28, 2013
Cutie64646, ^20532210^1^0^"So this my first Simcity game and looking at the past games, this one lookes the best. Even though it has some bugs, we all know that it will get a huge update. Maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow, but someday. One thing wrong about this is the cost. $60 for the Standard Edition, $70 for the Limited Edition, and $80 for the Double Deluxe Edition! The price should at least start at $40 or something else, but the price is bizarre! I got the game on Walmart for their their quick shipping, and that the Limited Edition is $10 lower than the Origin price. So i am on the fence to recommended this, but I say yes, but buy it off Walmart for a lower price than Origin (no offence Origin). So this is your choice, do you want to buy it or not?

jrud05, ^27831445^189^93^"I've been anxiously awaiting the release of The Sims 4 for quite some time. I was recently made aware of the missing pools and toddlers but I've been playing The Sims since the beginning so I decided I wasn't going to let that keep me from giving this game a shot.
At last the game has arrived! I get on to play and start creating my sim, the create a sim tool is great, I mean it's missing some simple things from TS3, like body hair but no biggie. So finally, I'm done creating and I get to start playing... Select a house? Okay, but why is this neighborhood all divided up into sections? Well... you can't simply travel around the neighborhood like before. What, are you joking? No! Remember what it was like in TS2? It's like that, loading screens to travel to and from a lot of places. Meh.
Fine whatever, let me just go get my usual job in the business career and it'll all be good. Nope, you can't do that either, sorry! My Sim just vanishes into thin air, I can't see his needs or anything while he's gone. There are many other things that I've found missing from the game compared to previous versions.
While the emotions of the sims are an interesting addition to the game, they most certainly do not make up for the all of the things that are now missing. The graphics in my opinion are only slightly better than before.
I remember the day the first Sims came out, I was glued, for hours and hours. It's only taken me about 3 hours to get bored with The Sims 4. Keep your money and stick with The Sims 3, you'll be glad you did.
I'll probably be returning my copy tonight via the Origin Great Game Guarantee because in my honest opinion, the game is a very stripped down version of the Sims 3 that is not worth the price tag."^1^September 3, 2014
Tizzypop, ^27831445^189^33^"As a Sims player since the first one came out, I think The Sims 4 is a great game. It runs beautifully on my 2 year old laptop on medium setting and it's not a gaming laptop nor anything close to it. The newer controls do take some time getting use to but it does have the option to revert to the Sims 3 controls so that's an easy fix if your having those issues. The graphics aren't as realistic as say GTA but with all the zany emotions and different sims running about I hardly notice. There are bugs, as with any new game, but so far EA has been prompt with dealing with them as they are brought to their attention. There aren't any pools or toddlers but the game is pretty fun without them. which I'm sure pools at least will be added later in a patch or something. Overall, it's a pretty good game."^5^September 8, 2014
1Yumi, ^27831445^171^24^"To be honest, I love this game. For those of you new to The Sims franchise, it can be summed up as simply a good virtual life simulation game.

For old fans, I'll go into more detail:
*Good for rotational-style play
*Much faster loading screens than The Sims 3
*The things that are missing from base game (ghosts, pools, many careers) are being added FOR FREE in future patches (ghosts are already added - pools and careers are confirmed for November's patch and December's patch; the only thing not confirmed to be added that's missing is the toddler life stage, and toddlers were annoying anyway)
*Babies are basically attached to their cribs, but there are many more social interactions you can do with them.
*Moods add a level of realism to the game - I like it way better than just the moodlets of TS3 (moodlets contribute to moods in this game)
*It is NOT open world like TS3 was, it's more like TS2 in that aspect (I personally rarely wanted to leave the house in TS3 anyway). However, this is a huge contributor to what makes the loading screens so near-instant. It's also way less laggy than TS3 was in game.
*Sims can look way more different than each other. They can actually look like different races. There's a bit of a learning curve with making adjustments in CAS (create-a-sim), but it really pays off if you like to have more variety in Sim appearances in your game. I've attached pictures of my first two Sims showcasing this. Namin is Korean, and Jynette is black. You can also change body types a lot, but I usually prefer to make thin-to-average-sized girls still.
*Multi-tasking is a nice little convenience. It's usually best for talking to other Sims while doing other things (such as cooking or painting), but there are some other uses as well. My picture of Namin shows her having two drinks at once.
*Ghosts are the color of their current emotion and have different abilities depending on how they died. I have not yet tested whether there are ghost babies in TS4.
*There are better buy and build-mode tools as well.
*I recommend downloading a faster gardening mod. You can get one from modthesims.
*There's too much other good stuff in this game to go on about, you can buy it and discover for yourself, or find a multitude of other information about it online.

I was nervous about buying the game when I did, because I heard negative things about it (mostly people complaining that it's not open-world), but once I played it, I loved it way more than I loved TS2 even, and that was my first Sims game. I hope this review was helpful to you. Good luck with your buying decision, and happy simming! :)"^4^October 12, 2014
Kandyland2002, ^27831445^146^23^"The sims are so smart, it's crazy. You almost don't even have to tell them to do anything. The build mode is SOOO much easier to deal with, and is set up better than any sims game so far. Excellent! I'm very impressed."^5^September 14, 2014
BlackGirlsSimToo, ^27831445^105^4^"I've the game for over two years now and it's really fun! A lot of people dislike this newest installment of the Sims because of the many things that were there in the previous games, but didn't make it to this one. ex; toddlers, open world, create-a-style, etc. The game is still very enjoyable without these features,  the sims are more lively, have more emotions, and I feel more connected to them. In the Sims 3 the sims eyes were lifeless. I think that many teenagers will enjoy this game. I would recommend buying this for them, especially now on Black Friday.  With the addition of expansion packs like Get To Work the game is even more fun! The Sims 4 is a really fun game and very enjoyable. The only things I would say I dislike about the game is the loading screens. If you're someone coming from playing  The Sims 3 the loading screens might take a little adjusting to, other than that it's a very enjoyable game. If you want to know more information you can always go online and research, watch videos, read reviews, etc."^5^November 22, 2016
megadicegirl, ^27831445^96^75^"I have been playing the sims since I was twelve years old. I began playing with the original sims.
Sadly, all the hype was a massive let down! The sims 3 is a much better series than this. EA has went all the way back to the sims 1 with better graphics. Don't get me wrong, the layout like the bar or HUD is pleasing but I honestly can't see what they spent most of there time on. EA has stripped away everything that made the sims charming. There is absolutely nothing for your sims to do. There is no activities, no community lots that are worth any entertainment. There isn't even graveyards! Basically your sims sit in their homes, go to work without you or go jogging. When you throw a party, there's nothing for them to do other than listen to the radio or watch TV. Word of advice, go through origin.com they have a refund policy, if you are so eager to try the sims 4."^1^September 5, 2014

GrannySleuth, ^27831445^69^47^"I almost wasn't going to write this review. This does not reflect on Walmart.

I feel like I'm testing a game in Beta release, not yet completed. I might have been okay with this purchase if the game had cost about $20.00 or even as much as $40.00.

It's just so bare-bones. Forget about building a decent house.

And the glitches. Good God. Have you seen what the babies look like with their eyes spearing out from their skulls???

EA made a big deal about how these new Sims would have emotions, but isn't jealousy an emotion? My Sim's husband was woohooing right in front of her, and she didn't even react!!!

Nope. I'm returning the game. I bought it locally, and if Walmart isn't allowed to refund the money, then I'll make EA do it.

After Sim City, I should have known better."^1^September 4, 2014
RobertaMae, ^27831445^68^9^"I think many people coming off the Sims 3 with all its content from expansions were blindsided by the lack of content that is in Sims 4.

For me, being a stand alone game, I am loving it. I have over a hundred hours in and still not have done a lot of the stuff in it.

There are goals to be met to unlock stuff. Some people don't like this. The feel it is too RPGish for them. I enjoy unlocking the items and achieving the goals. If you don't, they have cheats for that.

I have not had a crash.

Bugs??? What bugs? If they mean clipping(where a sim walks through another sim or an item such as a couch), I would much have that than the Sims 3 way dealing with something in the way, which would be cancelling action and standing there stomping their foot.
I have had a fork get stuck on a sim.( Easily fixed by going into CAS)

Emotions are really fun to play with. Whatever mood they are in, you can really see it in their expressions. There are different actions available depending on their moods.

CAS is so much fun. Some of the Star sims that players have made are so spot on. You can download them to your game.

Build mode is amazing. If you have any bit of a creative streak in ya. You will be building for hours. If you don't like to build, they have many pre-builts and stylized rooms to choose from. Also, some of the houses built by players will blow you away. They also can be downloaded and put into your game. My only wish for build mode would be automatic roofs.

Hours and hours of fun.

Reason for not giving it five stars....anything can have room for improvement."^4^September 25, 2014
ParentsWhoCare, ^27831445^58^8^"I got this game for my thirteen year old son's birthday. I was a little worried about the T rating however when I did my research I was relieved to see it hardly deserved a T rating. The T rating comes from only a few things including, beating up a sim (in a cloud of dust so it can't be seen), using the bathroom (pixels cover everything.), and using the shower and again pixels cover it. So parents, don't deny your child a pleasurable (maybe even a bit educational) experience. You're kids will be glad you got this."^5^October 26, 2014

ohempton, ^27831445^46^35^"Don't waste your money buying this game. This game has less of everything than even the basic version of Sims 3, which severely limits the increased in graphics and character improvements. It comes with two worlds which come with a total of 17 lots in each world, including already used lots for places like parks, gyms, etc. Houses have a total of 12 lots, with 4 unbuilt lots. A huge decrease from Sims 3 and greatly inhibits growth and generational play.

Don't waste your time with this game until several expansions have come out, then if you want to shell out over $100 for the game and expansions, then go for it. But right now, stick with Sims 3"^1^September 4, 2014
^27831445^30^10^"Sims 4 has been a while coming, and I wasn't excited at first. I wasn't going to play the game until I'd heard from someone else if it was worthwhile, because I'd heard a ton about it, and I was wary of the changes. After it came out, I immediately started hearing good things, and impulsively bought Sims 4 from my local Walmart, keeping a firm grasp on my return policy receipt.
Boy, was I surprised.
Laptop mode runs beautifully on my 2 year old laptop, without completely destroying the graphics. I've experienced almost no glitches or lagging, even when my Sims' house is full of guests. The routing problems have all but disappeared, and the new CAS and Build/Buy modes are beautiful.
Of course, with all the positives, some things have changed. There are WAY fewer lots to move into, as most of them are full and there are only a few empty build lots in each world. The community lots are lacking, and there is no open world. If you aren't interested in your Sims being extremely active hosts to a gaggle of individual friends, this might not be the game for you.
Overall, the new social system and multi-tasking abilities are a huge improvement, but there are few lots, and the community lots are a bit boring if you're used to the hustle and bustle of Sims 3's Bridgeport. Still, worth a try if you're a casual Sims fan who wants an improvement on the lagging, glitching, awkward Sims of generations past."^4^September 10, 2014

TimoL14, ^27831445^7^2^"Having been an avid player of Sims 2 and Sims 3 I decided to buy the Deluxe Edition when it came out for my wife and I (we play on separate computers in the same room when we do it).

My first reactions were, 'Wow the graphics are significantly better,' and, 'oh this user design flow is really nice and the genetic feature is pretty nifty.' After that though everything seemed to just go down hill from there for me.

The first thing that bothered me was the lot size. You really don't have an opportunity to have too many sims living near each other because there is a very small amount of room where you can build homes / businesses and after a few test runs you'll quickly find yourself out of room and needing to go to another neighborhood.

The second thing was really just the fact it didn't feel fun to manage this sim's life versus previous games. People grow up way too quickly so I end up not having enough time to really live the life. I'm playing a video game not some sort of inheritance simulator where you have to build up a family from rags to riches through the generations.

I just wish the magic of Sims 2 and 3 was there where I felt like I could make my character into whatever I wanted (a famous artist, etc) without watching the other aspects of their life crumble because I was focused on a goal. I found if I wanted to get my character to the highest tiers I had to pretty much 1) invite lady friend over to talk while he works, 2) fit a shower in after completing said work somehow, 3) hope lady friend will clean the house for him while he falls asleep from exhaustion, and then 4) begin the whole flow again; I feel like having my Sim succeed in this iteration is more of a chore. It'd have been survivable for me if the loading screens weren't everywhere and so slow which kills the environment but unfortunately they're terrible.

I get how this can be fun to some people but as a legacy Sims user I just really don't get it. Maybe it's just me so take this with a grain of salt but I think EA really lost the mark here. There's fun to be had in the game just not by me."^2^November 21, 2015

But when I downloaded it onto my desktop it wouldn't open so I had to download it onto my laptop that is newer and it worked. But the game is not as good as Sims 3. The color wheel is no longer there and the options for the camera was almost unusable so I ended up using the Sims 3 camera anyways. Not having the color wheel and being able to customize certain things definitely takes away from the game but the graphics are pretty awesome the people are more realistic so I gave them two thumbs up for that. Hopefully on the Sims 5 they will take basically everything from Sims 3 and the improved Graphics from 4 and put them together.

Kletus4Ever, ^43816066^83^8^"I didn't exactly have low hopes for Sims 4's first expansion, but I didn't expect it to be as fun as it is. I'm one of the types that has to mention I've been playing the Sims since the very first one. (Sorry) But I mention it because since the very beginning, Sims fans have always wanted to control their working sims at that Sim's job. We finally get to do this and it could have turned out annoying or bad, but didn't.

If you didn't know, there are three controllable careers, plus you can open your own business and control it. I'll admit that's not much, but anyone that's played an EA game knows that they'll milk our wallets for expansions. But don't hold that against The Sims. It's like that will all games these days.

I won't reveal too much about Get To Work, but I will say a few things. The careers you can control are medical, scientist, and detective (if you didn't know this yet). Just like when you go on dates in the base game, with this you have objectives you can achieve at that Sim's job. You don't have to if you don't want to. If you want, you can just play around with stuff at their job. You can even do construction at your workplace and edit the building or grounds. Or you can achieve the goals they give you which will help you get promoted faster.

Now remember I said things could have been worse, but turned out great? One example is that you don't HAVE TO follow your sim to work if you don't want to. If you'd rather focus on another sim from that family you can. If you don't follow your sim to work, then it's just like it always has been where the sim's work performance will depend on their mood. So you don't have to controll them at their job if you would rather play another sim from that lot at their job, or doing something else. I like that.

I also like how I can load up another lot and be a customer at the other lot's job. Like I could open a business as one sim, then later playing another lot, I could go visit that same business and be it's customer. I didn't expect that.

There's a ton of new items for our sims' homes-- more furniture, decorations, more interections, etc. They improved existing interactions that came with the base game. Many new improvements to the existing stuff.

I found that I was playing the game a lot more often after I had gotten this expansions. There's only a few complaints and they're very minor complaints. One is that I hate launchers. I hate having to load stuff before I can load the game. Another complaint is that when you're controlling a sim at their job, the very second their work day ends, the game automatically loads up their home lot again. You can't stay late at their job and finish a task or mess around with stuff. I hate being kicked off the work lot the second the work shift ends. My final complaint is the price of the expansion. I agree that it is overpriced. I blame Electronic Arts for that, not the Sims creators.

But as I said, these are minor complaints. The expansion is still a lot of fun and improves Sims 4. Personally, I'd recommend buying the disc version and not a digital download. If you ever have to reinstall the game, you won't have to wait for the long download that would have to take place before the actual reinstall.

If you've ever liked the Sims, you'll like this. You just have to give it a chance and actually play it so you can see Sims 4 is the best one yet."^5^April 13, 2015
BlackGirlsSimToo, ^43816066^9^1^"I've had Get to Work for about a year now, and what I can say is that it is a good addition to the base game. Your sims now have active careers and your able to follow your sims to work and complete tasks with them. You also can run your own store or business. You get the new photography skill, baking skill, and many other interactions. When I first bought the game I was very impressed and I had loads of fun playing with it during the first couple of months. After a while, taking your sims to work became boring. The tasks you have to repeat are very repetitive, this expansion can lose it's new game shine very quickly if you aren't into repeating things. You get a lot of new clothes, hair, and makeup in Create a Sim so that's a plus. They also have an alien life state, your male sims can even get pregnant with an alien baby! That was very fun to play with. I would recommend getting this expansion, but also look into getting Get Together so you can add something more once you get bored of this one. Overall is a good expansion adds something fresh to the base game, but can get boring after you've done all the careers."^4^November 22, 2016

Downers: Memory HOG. I have 8GB on board (max for my older system) but still received low memory warnings. I was able to win a match on Chieftain without any real issues, but it crashed when I tried a mod match on Warlord. I found that my page file was quite small so I raised it to 8GB virtual RAM. I'll be checking out that fix after I finish this review. I'm pretty sure it'll fix the problem.

These careers are so much more involved than the regular careers. It comes with plenty of cute clothing for both men and women. And some pretty cute hairstyles.

Nightfeathers, ^16793184^14^6^"The Sims series is one that I have long enjoyed. Last Christmas when I was looking around for something to get myself, it didn't take me long to decide. I had been enjoying the Sims 2 for quite some time, so I decided to upgrade. I bought the combination of the base Sims3 as well as this expansion and one other.

Gameplay itself is much improved. I quite like the additional features, yet it still retained the familiarity of the Sims 2. The base game works just fine on my computer with no issues and very little lag.

Then came the Pets. I was very excited about this part of the game, because you finally get to control the pets the way you can the Sims themselves. It sounded like an amazing upgrade, so as soon as Christmas came I eagerly installed and updated my game, only to suffer extreme disappointment.

Visit Youtube and you can readily find videos of the kind of distortion I was dismayed to find occurring in my game. It only seems to effect the pets themselves, and only the cats, dogs, and horses at that. They simply don't render properly. Their images are horridly distorted such that one cannot even tell the species until a sound effect gives it away. Often some body parts will float some distance away or be turned around backwards altogether!

It is impossible to enjoy playing with pets that look more like the result of a nuclear attack. I can't use what was one of my main motivations for playing the game. For the first few months, owners of the Sims Pets expansion, many of whom were suffering as I was, were led to believe there would be a patch. I had faith that this was true, and during this time bought the Sims Medieval as well.

As it turns out, we were lied to. EA Games now says that it is not their problem, and refuse to fix this glitch. My only option is to turn to third party software, or just not play an expansion I have already paid $30 to get! There is a third party solution out there too, so I know it is not just our computers. EA Games is being completely irresponsible and ignoring the needs of consumers of what is probably their most popular product. Sadly because of this I will not be buying anything more from them until I can see for sure that it works properly, and I will definitely never buy until the cost goes down. I, for one, cannot afford to throw away another $30-40 on a product the company will not even ensure is working properly."^1^July 21, 2012

There are other animals but they aren't as interactive as cats, dogs, and horses. The expansion is not worth 30$ and I'm not buying any others until they come down. I like sims 2 more anyway."^2^April 4, 2012
vamperus, ^16793184^5^7^"EA was not ready to release Sims 3 Pets, there is a glitch where every 3-5 seconds the characters freeze but the water and sound continues. Then after about 2 minutes it will unfreeze only to freeze again in a few seconds. EA told me to uninstall and reinstall, that did nothing, I have a lot of space on my computer, and the video card is new, and my computer was bought a year ago. EA will also say it is because I have a MAC, but I have a PC with Windows 7.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The glitch is from the CD not my computer, the newest patch didn't fix it. I took it back to Wal-Mart for an exchange, still no luck so tomorrow I will be Getting a refund. Just do a search on Google for pets 3 freezing if you don't believe me."^1^April 21, 2012

1)This game lacks rewarding experience. Rewards include weapons that are close in stats. You get to unlock appearance of stormtrooper and rebel soldier, which are hair and face only until you reach level 40. You don't get to choose Tie fighter pilot look until level 50.
2) It takes way to long to level up. 2 weeks playing every day got to level 11 out of 50.
3) Not able to choose Rebels or Empire when in multiplayer battles. The Game picks for you. This could be good and or bad depending on your likes.

Pros
1) If you just want to run around as a Random star wars rebel or stormtrooper and shoot each other without getting worthwhile rewards then go for it.
2)Cool Weapons
3) Cool multiplayer planetary air craft battles. xwing awing tie fighters. so far doesn't have space battles. as far as i know.

It also took him a while to figure out switch between the bombs and missiles. Apparently, the jets would switch to other types of ammo, but would not fire them. Not sure how he's doing it now though. He's definitely more into Rome right now so he'll play this when he gets bored of Rome, which is very rare.

Setup of the game was also difficult. It took us a while to figure it out. Thank goodness for Google. We had Steam set up on the computer already because he plays other games, but the game would not run.

I was under the distinct impression that this was a PC-Game, there was NO indication that a monthly service would be required to play. Now I am out the expansion pack which did not note previous software was required, the basic software, and can't play, because it is rediculous to subscribe to play a PC Game."^1^January 9, 2009
SCOTTinELECTRONICS, ^5272734^1^9^"I played WoW... and it just made me miss City of Heroes. The battles in WoW are so base and boring. Same as the character movement. Storylines are pretty dull also. I'd rather jump around all over the place... fly... teleport... super speed etc etc than get stuck walking in WoW."^2^July 26, 2007
TMfan88, ^5272734^1^6^"I have played wow since about 2 months after its release. And the expansion since the night of its release. In the beginning wow was a very very awsome experience. Your enemy would raid your cities and towns and you would do the same to them. The first pvp experience I had I will never forget. But........wow is not like it used to be. The best way I can describe this is the game is 20% fun and 80% grind and frustration. I have defeated every piece of content the burning crusade xpac has to offer ( yes that means i've killed illidan many times) And I will admit I had alot of fun but I've also felt like everytime I go to raid I'm doing a job that I dont want to do. The battleground option of the game is very fun about half the time. But most of the time you will find yourself on the opposite end of a 10 man team destroying you while the rest of your team is afk or they just arent trying to win. The pvp is very very imbalanced between all the classes making some of the classes WAYYYY overpowered compared to other classes even if you in the best gear ingame.
If your looking for a fun game I would suggest looking elswhere. WoW at one time was a blast but now that has faded. Everytime you log on you will feel as if your going to work instead of logging on to have fun. This game is a waste of time and I feel bad that I've spent hundreds of dollars just to go to work and have a few moments of fun here and there. It costs about $180.00 to play this game yearly ontop of the 50-60 dollar cost of buying new xpacs. Be warned"^1^December 5, 2007

Darrell4021, ^37147047^3^2^"Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a 2007 action-adventure video game, part of the Tomb Raider series. It is a remake of the first video game in the series, the original 1996 Tomb Raider. It uses an improved version of the Legend game engine,[3] and it includes all of the original environments from Tomb Raider.[3]

The game was co-developed by Crystal Dynamics and Buzz Monkey Software for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2, Windows and Wii.[4] Eidos announced 1 June 2007 as the European release date for the PS2 and Windows version, with the North American release to follow on 5 June 2007.[5][6] Additionally, the subscription PC gaming service GameTap announced that the game will be available on their service on the same day as the game went to retailers.[7] The PSP version was released on 9 August 2007 in the United States and on 26 October 2007 in Europe, with the Wii version released in Europe on 7 December 2007.[8] An Xbox 360 version was released on 23 October 2007[9] and a version for the PlayStation 3 is included in The Tomb Raider Trilogy collection released in March 2011.[10] The Mac OS X version of the game was released in February 2008 by Feral Interactive.[1]

The game was well received by critics, with the PC version holding the highest score. It holds an 83 on Metacritic and 84.28% on GameRankings. The game sold 2.3 million copies worldwide.[11]"^3^June 15, 2015

Ahumblereviewer, ^42496713^3^26^"A number of people who already own Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn and have pre-ordered this game, Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward - an expansion of A Realm Reborn - have complained about encountering numerous problems in redeeming the pre-order bonus code to gain early access to this game.

I, myself, pre-ordered the PC download collector's edition of this game and had to immediately return it for a full refund because the pre-order bonus code I received and redeemed at Square Enix's official website gave me the wrong registration code. I received a Mac registration code instead of the Windows registration doe - even though I bought the Windows version of Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward. I already own the Windows and PS4 versions of its predecessor, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.

Support by the manufactuer constitutes a major portion of the overall quality of a game, especially for a MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) one like Final Fantasy XIV. Sadly, Square Enix, failed badly here for this game, at least for me. Your experience may be different."^1^June 21, 2015
Mashidar, ^2432482^31^3^"World of Warcraft is without a doubt one of the biggest hits for the MMORPG world in many years. With over 11 Million subscribers it's hard to think there's anything that will topple the giant that is WoW.

Yet there is a good reason why they are the best at what they do because they not only give a polished product upon release, but they are able to target both the hardcore player and the casual player. They can target the Player vs Player, PvP, crowd as well as the Player vs Enviroment, PvE, crowd.

This is the 2nd expansion in the World of Warcraft series and allows you to travel to Northrend to battle against The Lich King Arthas. Northrend is a level 68+ area so you must have someone leveled at least that high to travel to the new realm.

If you have someone above level 55 then you can create the new Hero Class known as a Death Knight. As someone who has a level 70 Warrior at the moment I can tell you that I spent the first few hours of the release playing a Death Knight, DE, and found myself enjoying the new combat style of the death knight as well as playing a class that could tank things without a shield. If you do pick up the expansion I suggest you give this shot a try, at least to play the new intro for the class and learn how this class came about into the lore of the WoW Universe.

Overall there are many improvements on all fronts that make this title a great pick up for fans of the series that have already been playing for awhile. If you have yet to level someone above level 55 then there might not be much for you at the moment to enjoy."^5^November 14, 2008
rwh531, ^2432482^18^43^"I started playing world of warcraft in late 2004 it was a good game back then that required a huge time investment and was very addictive.

I bought this expansion pack the day it was released and it has utterly destroyed the game the player vs player system is not balanced while the player vs environment aka raiding has become a bunch of mindless dribble that is not in the least bit challenging.

Furthermore this game is not kid friendly their are quests that refer to women as Ho's , others that promote killing yourself conjuring the dead and just all forms of demonic rituals.

The game it self is very laggy and randomely freezes as it is full of bugs many of the players class abilities do not work correctly if at all.

Also the class Balancing is so bad that many of the classes are just not wanted in groups because they perform poorly compared to other classes."^1^December 24, 2008
Vancetechnology, ^2432482^18^1^"i work hard on a road construction crew, and ive been playing WoW for over 3 years now, this expansion is great, the death knight is an awesome class to play, northrend is a great area, not as cool as outland, but still great. raiding is ok...not nearly as challenging as it was in vanilla and burning crusade, but still fun, the change in difficulty will allow casual players to see more content."^4^August 11, 2009
MScottPaperCompany, ^2432482^10^3^"This expansion was a nice addition to WoW but is still lacking in many areas in my opinion. The Death Knights are a very cool class and have been performing great in raids whether they are specced for DPS or Tanking. Northrend is a nice new continent but at the same time by the time you hit level 76 and still have 4 to go you are going to be so bored of the endless grind that you will never want to set foot in Northrend again. Just way too much XP to level in my opinion. Overall decent though and the game has become more casual player friendly with raids like Naxx10, Obsidian sanctum etc. 4 out of 5 stars."^4^September 12, 2009

RichardInPA, ^2432482^4^0^"Let me start by saying; This expansion is much better than 'Burning Crusade', for anyone wondering.

This is an additional expansion module for the original game, 'World of Warcraft' or 'WoW'. The entire game is a great value for the money, even with the modest $15/mo fee to play online, which is necessary to play the game.

The original game, and 'Burning Crusade' are also required. So, unless you have those already, I suggest starting with the original World of Warcraft game, then adding the expansions. You will get months of play time before these are necessary to continue.

I would not personally recommend 'WoW' for anyone under age. The game does have some moral merit, although many of those concepts are actually a little complicated for a child to comprehend and it is too easy for an unsupervised child to take the wrong course of action without consequence. It also contains violence, and interaction with other players that provide a host of bad examples for children. The other problem with it for young children is that it takes a tremendous amount of time to accomplish anything, and will interfere with their responsibilities, such as homework and chores.

On the other hand, I highly recommend this game for anyone between the ages of 18 and 100. My mother plays at the age of 83. She has been playing for over 5 years now and loves it! It provides her with hours of entertainment without leaving the comfort of her desk chair. This includes social interaction, since the game is played via online connection to thousands of other players.

These are my personal opinions of the game and do not reflect the intent of the makers, nor are they designed to interfere with sales. I enjoy the game myself and endorse it for what I consider the proper age groups.

Buy it, dive in, and enjoy! It's a lot of fun and well worth the money considering the months and years of play you will get for it!"^5^September 7, 2010

I feel questing areas are a lot of fun, with the random annoying quests...dungeons seem to be fun..only issue I have is...a lot of the new players seem to not know what they are doing, and its very frustrating to where I will sometimes log out and take a break.

I leveled my Druid from 70 to 80 in like 5 days, and now am 72 on my rogue. So, leveling isn't that bad, and is actually quite some fun. Gold rains in which is nice. I can't wait to play Cat and start doing end game again. Some people said this expansion blew, but I don't feel it did...you won't know how you feel until you try it for yourself.

I feel the price was weird at $40 when Cat is $40. I feel this expansion should of well been $19.99. Not because it blew....which it doesn't..but just because you can't charge full price for a old expansion when it's already been outdated by a newer expansion..but that is Blizzard for you :P

I would like to make more deathknights to try the different talent trees, but I don't have time to make a 55 on multiple servers! Another problem with this is that it is very, very glitchy. Someone in general chat said it should be called 'Wrath of the Glitch King', and I agree.

The next expansion is also expected to come out in just 2 months, so none of the content of this expansion will be played anymore as soon as the new one is released.

I own so many pc slot games and this one they added slot games from their other pc slot games to this. WHY? The highest denomination .$25 (most games) again WHY? After all these years the pc slot game world is going downwards at max speed. Phantom EFX and WMS slots I am not a happy customer at all. Is this the best you can do for your loyal and faithful customers? This slot team needs to go into a real casino look and watch the games that are being played. Where are the up to date games and collaboration with Aristocrat, Konami, IGT and others. If you need help or any advice on what's hot and really being played in the casino 2016 I'll be happy to help."^1^April 1, 2016

Norskie2, ^15384789^10^0^"We bought the 3 pack and our kids love them all! Charlie Church Mouse games teach counting, telling time, spelling, phonics, listening comprehension, good values, and Bible Stories to name just a few. When I asked my son what his favorite thing was he said 'Everything and also Charlie's motorcycle'! My daughter, when asked the same question, said 'I liked making my own cake on the Esther part.' She then told me that every kid should have this game and I would agree with her!!

BrBlack, ^10930389^10^16^"Beautiful Game. Graphics are nice, in game sounds give me a chuckle. However for the following reasons, i did not enjoy this game.

*Can not set difficulty level.
*Can not play computer oponents. only campaigns and single missions available besides online oponents or lan with friends.
*I can only complete the tutorial and first couple Campaigns. Rest are all advanced.
*Sewers and Graveyards (Appear in your city and can not be destroyed) constantly pound you with rats and skeletins before you even get a foothold.
*Enemies are so close, once you start building anything, fog of war opens up revealing an enemy spawn location, and they come in non stop.
*Some missions say 'Stay away from the enemy till your strong enough' While your peasents run up and start building houses 10 miles out of your city in enemy territory.
*Can't zoom out very far.
*Can't Make money fast enough vs how many mobs constantly come in.
*Some levels enemies just come from off screen and walk right into your town and attack. They keep coming, can't destroy their spawn point.
*Price of buildings are doubled every time you build. So making enough towers for defence is just not possible.
*You can only make 3 units per building. And you need to upgrade each building and all of their spells as far as i can tell.
*Feels cramped, everything so close together.

If you want a beautiful game that hands your rear to you every time you play it. then this is the game for you.
But for me, i wish i spent my 40 dollars on something different."^1^November 22, 2009

Gamercat, ^7788977^0^1^"It has alot of the typical problems of an early release MMORPG. I found some things I enjoyed about the game but many things I didn't. You are very restricted as to where you can travel in the game. I prefer a free roaming game where I can go and explore everything. Some of the graphics are nice though I found the characters look plastic or rubber. Not very attractive. I also hate the interface, its cumbersom and not at all easy to figure out. Took me forever to find out how to get to a menu so I could exit the stupid game! I haven't played it since."^2^June 18, 2008

Nights, ^21365541^11^3^"If you are looking at this, you probably are or are shopping for a seasoned WoW player. This is probably the best expansion pack ever released. The additional features, playable classes, new lands and raid content will entertain for months. Because Blizzard constantly updates, adding new content and always making the game more challenging, its an excellent value for the money.

As the previous reviewer noted, NEVER buy a used game and ALWAYS ensure the box seals are intact. The game its self is free for download online, but to unlock the content you need the unique code that will be in the box. If the code is missing or used, the product is useless and needs to be returned."^5^December 17, 2012

Kerdomrikman, ^21365541^2^1^"Whereas I shop Walmart and have for many years, I have to say that this item is currently well overpriced at $34.96. It is currently (and has been for a long time) priced only $19.99 at the Blizzard online store. Blizzard will often offer it at 1/2 off the $19.99 price.

As for the game itself, it's WoW, either ya love it or ya don't! I've been playing since the release of Burning Crusade. The game has changed a lot over the years and this expansion (Mists of Pandaria) has made the game far too easy....there's little to no challenge anymore. I still play WoW daily but I've reduced my game to the free (trial) version. In my opinion it's just not worth paying a monthly fee to play the upper content. Hopefully the next expansion will return some difficulty to the game."^3^March 11, 2014

It says in the description that it is a CHAT headset, not like a Turtle Beach where you can hear game sounds No, you do not hear game sounds through this headset. It does what I needed it to, which is be able to party chat with a friend of mine. I love the mic switch off slider-thingy and volume control on the cord.

RegrettingPurchase1, ^20532210^56^38^"I was able to log in to the game when I first installed the game without any issues. I had to run an errand and when I tried to log into the game I was put into a que. I have been que'ing for hours.

I went to the forums and I am not the only one that has wasted hours waiting to log in and play the game.

This is possibly related to the game being new and EA not being prepared for the load so if you have not purchased the game yet I would hold off on purchasing the game until they get this situated. If not you, you can play the que game with the rest of us.

You must have an internet connection to play this game."^1^March 5, 2013
cupcakezz, ^20532210^45^30^"I give this 4/5 stars. As much as I love Sim City games, this one has to be the best I've seen in a long, long time. The people here giving it a 1/5 stars are too biased at the fact that this game is new and requires an internet connection. No one, not even EA could foresee how well the game would actually sell, thus giving it some problems on launch. But as far as actual game play goes, mind blowing! Now, I agree that the whole DRM part factors into the rating, which is pretty much the only reason why I gave this a 4/5 instead of 5/5... As far as the business end goes, EA definitely did the right thing with DRM, even though it is an inconvenience to some.

All in all- Game play, 5/5; DRM and online issues 3/5 ( But you must realize this will not be an issue for ever. I'm sure EA is fixing it, or even has fixed it already by the time you read this review)

Final verdict: Amazing game to play and watch. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone who wants to try out a Sim City game, or even to those long time veterans."^4^March 10, 2013
FlyinBryin89, ^20532210^35^14^"At the beginning of the release, trying to play was terrible with all the server overloads. The game itself is fantastic and very addicting. Ive played for a couple days straight now and havent had any problems playing on the servers. EA has done multiple fixes with the servers including adding a ton more to take the load off the rest of the servers. The game is worth buying 'now'. Dont let the bad reviews steer you away from a great game with great potential. Ive logged 20 hours in a week playing this."^4^March 11, 2013
DeadlyJoaquin, ^20532210^32^22^"The game itself is great. But what is killing it is the DRM always connected forced feature. I was able to play it for a while on launch day. But now I can't play at all because of the ineptitude of EA deciding to save my gameplay on a server instead of on my hard drive and all servers being down. I just hope that my investment can be rewarded later on when they finally fix the servers."^1^March 6, 2013
Livewire90210, ^20532210^21^17^"But since the EA SimCity servers are overloaded, you'll never actually get to play. I've owned the game for 48hours, and have had less than 1 hour of playable time. During that hour I was also repeatedly disconnected and unable to play for longer than 5 minutes - this game is an absolute waste of the disc it was printed on, an abhorrent time sink for updates and attempting to actually login, and a disgrace to video gaming in general.

If you don't believe me, go take a peek at EA's 'Answer HQ' for the game - no answers, only questions regarding when exactly the servers will be playable. EA is supposedly working to resolve the problem, however there is no time-frame, and they've already been flat out wrong and indicated the servers were up when they were, in fact, down for emergency maintenance.

Don't waste your time and money. Get SimCity 4 if you're that desperate for a good SimCity game - that one doesn't require EA to have their servers in working order."^1^March 7, 2013
gamergirl4life, ^20532210^20^2^"If I would have given a review days after buying this game it most likely would have been poor. As a huge MMO gamer, server issues was something I deal with often. After EA finally got it together and we were all able to play. My review is 5 stars. There is so much to do, hours and hours of game time. The online aspect is great.

When I first put the disc in my PC, logged onto Origin (which I can't stand but you have to use it in order to play) there were many updates that had to be downloaded. I haven't been kicked off a server yet and have enjoyed hours and hours of game play. My PC is about 4 years old and plays the game well and the graphics are ok but if I had a newer computer I'm sure it would look even better. To any of you who are on the fence about buying the game: I say buy it. It seems EA has been updating the game on a regular basis and it has been out for two months now.

usernameneeded, ^20532210^10^10^"This game has DRM (Digital Rights Management) that requires you to always be logged onto EA's (EA being the publisher of this video game) online servers. The biggest problem here is that huge numbers of people who purchased this game are unable to log on because the servers that are available to play on are unable to accommodate all the people trying to play. Those that do manage to log on, loose connection almost immediately after booting the game up. This game at the moment is as far as I am concerned, is broken and would advise anyone who might to be interested in buying to stay away from this title until at least the problems w/ it have been addressed."^1^March 8, 2013

Jabuds, ^20532210^8^3^"This game is by far fun to play. Maxis did a great job with the game. Although the servers are down a lot, once you are in the game and playing the down servers have no affect on you. This game is a 5/5 no doubt, but that potential is kind of shot since you have to be connected to the internet even when you are just playing single player.

Mostly due to updates and being knocked off their servers. And when I am able to play, the gameplay is extremely slow......Save your money for another game........No offline play what so ever.....Going back to playing SimCity4. 10 years have passed since this one was released and the new version goes back in time.. They have even turned of some functionality of this game. I paid full price how come I don't get a full game?"^1^March 9, 2013
JimMNH, ^20532210^7^6^"Thousands are reporting these connectivity issues in forums everywhere. Game requires you connect to their servers for single player; even tutorial. With the servers offline or in a constant state of patching over the past two days few are able to connect. And those that are able cannot join a game or create their own single player map which also requires connectivity to a server to 'save your game to their cloud'. Game is overpriced to begin with but this is brutal as it makes that overpriced game unplayable .. even unlaunchable. As a fan and owner of every version since classic b&w this is a terrible failure for EA/Maxis. They started offering refunds and then backpedaled on this too. THIS is a prime example of why PC gamers feel that Steam rules and Origin su__s .. just in case you're still missing the point."^1^March 9, 2013
GamerAda, ^20532210^7^7^"I've had this game for just shy of a week now and I've only been able to play it for about thirty minutes in total. It is a single-player game that *requires* a constant Internet connection. Their servers have been failing constantly and I'm often not able to get a connection. When I do, there's a wait queue that I've spent up to an hour in. Who wants to play a game where you have to start it up and then wait for an hour to start playing? Not me. I'm finished with SimCity and I'm finished with EA after this debacle. What a waste of money."^1^March 9, 2013
Zamaza, ^20532210^7^7^"The SimCity launch has been plagued with server stability issues. Now that many of those issues are being resolved and people are getting into play, a plethora of game breaking bugs are showing up, making cities unplayable. It's also possible for your city or region files to get corrupted and continuously get a 'Cannot load this city at this time. Please try again' message loop, losing hours of progress permanently.

The multiplayer, one of the 'key elements' of this game is buggy. Sending and sharing resources and vehicles with friends is delayed 5 minutes to an hour. Sometimes, money or resources sent are never received, but are still deducted from the player sending them.

SimCity has some good elements and a lot of the gameplay is fun, until it bugs out, which seems to happen to everyone. Save your money. Wait until the game drops in price and the issues are fixed."^1^March 13, 2013

It's a great way to break the time for me because its summer break and i play the iOS app; Clash of clans, Which is a game where you wait for buildings to upgrade which takes real time. So while im playing SimCity, time is going by quickly.

When I bought it, I thought I was buying a game that the kids would play offline after it was installed. That does not appear to be the case. If you don't want your kids exposed to or playing with strangers on the internet you probably do not want to buy this product. The kids like to play computer games sometimes while I'm working. Due to my computer needs for work, they cannot be on the internet while I'm working therefore this game is useless until I'm done working for the day.

WolfyZ, ^20532210^4^1^"Simcity was a game that I held high hopes for, only to be let down quickly when I actually was able to play it.
The Always online was an annoyance, one that looking back should have steered me away from the game all together. Game maker Maxis, and EA assured us that was because calcualtions performed in the background required the server itself to do the heavy lifting. This was later admmited to be false, as well as proven by the gamming community. Now they say that they had to make it online, because it was their vision to do so. What about your customers visions of what a franchise was, and should be?
Aside from the horrible Online aspect, the game itself has glaring flaws. (though Maxis is trying to work to improve them.)
First and foremost is traffic issues, the sims will always take the shortest path from point A to B, even if that path is a two lane dirt road. Secondly, the sims always start the day unemployed, and fill in jobs starting with the closest to them. This too causes traffic congestion with every sim in the game going for one open job till it's full, then onto the next closest.
Fire trucks and other emergency vehicles spend all their time in traffic, almost making their addition in your city pointless.
I am sure within a few months, all these points will be addressed and likely fixed. That doesn't take away from the fact that the game shipped out on day one, was unplayable, and as of this writing still is if you have any serious intentions to make a working city when playing."^2^March 19, 2013

Heatherrules09, ^20532210^1^1^"Awesome game. I love the gameplay, love the graphics, and love how more flexible it is in some areas. However, I wish it was more flexible like Simcity 4. I always loved being able to create my own landscapes, choose the size of the city, and actually have the game work the majority of the time. I love in a rural area where fast internet isn't always available so it is very disappointing that I can't enjoy my game because of it being terribly slow or not working.
I played the demo of this game and absolutely loved it. However, when I bought the game (I preordered it) I found so many things that I didn't like. It doesn't seem completely user-friendly, I've had a hard time figuring out all the options and extras, but it does have a lot of cool features that really put you 'in your city'.

Cutie64646, ^20532210^1^0^"So this my first Simcity game and looking at the past games, this one lookes the best. Even though it has some bugs, we all know that it will get a huge update. Maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow, but someday. One thing wrong about this is the cost. $60 for the Standard Edition, $70 for the Limited Edition, and $80 for the Double Deluxe Edition! The price should at least start at $40 or something else, but the price is bizarre! I got the game on Walmart for their their quick shipping, and that the Limited Edition is $10 lower than the Origin price. So i am on the fence to recommended this, but I say yes, but buy it off Walmart for a lower price than Origin (no offence Origin). So this is your choice, do you want to buy it or not?

jrud05, ^27831445^189^93^"I've been anxiously awaiting the release of The Sims 4 for quite some time. I was recently made aware of the missing pools and toddlers but I've been playing The Sims since the beginning so I decided I wasn't going to let that keep me from giving this game a shot.
At last the game has arrived! I get on to play and start creating my sim, the create a sim tool is great, I mean it's missing some simple things from TS3, like body hair but no biggie. So finally, I'm done creating and I get to start playing... Select a house? Okay, but why is this neighborhood all divided up into sections? Well... you can't simply travel around the neighborhood like before. What, are you joking? No! Remember what it was like in TS2? It's like that, loading screens to travel to and from a lot of places. Meh.
Fine whatever, let me just go get my usual job in the business career and it'll all be good. Nope, you can't do that either, sorry! My Sim just vanishes into thin air, I can't see his needs or anything while he's gone. There are many other things that I've found missing from the game compared to previous versions.
While the emotions of the sims are an interesting addition to the game, they most certainly do not make up for the all of the things that are now missing. The graphics in my opinion are only slightly better than before.
I remember the day the first Sims came out, I was glued, for hours and hours. It's only taken me about 3 hours to get bored with The Sims 4. Keep your money and stick with The Sims 3, you'll be glad you did.
I'll probably be returning my copy tonight via the Origin Great Game Guarantee because in my honest opinion, the game is a very stripped down version of the Sims 3 that is not worth the price tag."^1^September 3, 2014
Tizzypop, ^27831445^189^33^"As a Sims player since the first one came out, I think The Sims 4 is a great game. It runs beautifully on my 2 year old laptop on medium setting and it's not a gaming laptop nor anything close to it. The newer controls do take some time getting use to but it does have the option to revert to the Sims 3 controls so that's an easy fix if your having those issues. The graphics aren't as realistic as say GTA but with all the zany emotions and different sims running about I hardly notice. There are bugs, as with any new game, but so far EA has been prompt with dealing with them as they are brought to their attention. There aren't any pools or toddlers but the game is pretty fun without them. which I'm sure pools at least will be added later in a patch or something. Overall, it's a pretty good game."^5^September 8, 2014
1Yumi, ^27831445^171^24^"To be honest, I love this game. For those of you new to The Sims franchise, it can be summed up as simply a good virtual life simulation game.

For old fans, I'll go into more detail:
*Good for rotational-style play
*Much faster loading screens than The Sims 3
*The things that are missing from base game (ghosts, pools, many careers) are being added FOR FREE in future patches (ghosts are already added - pools and careers are confirmed for November's patch and December's patch; the only thing not confirmed to be added that's missing is the toddler life stage, and toddlers were annoying anyway)
*Babies are basically attached to their cribs, but there are many more social interactions you can do with them.
*Moods add a level of realism to the game - I like it way better than just the moodlets of TS3 (moodlets contribute to moods in this game)
*It is NOT open world like TS3 was, it's more like TS2 in that aspect (I personally rarely wanted to leave the house in TS3 anyway). However, this is a huge contributor to what makes the loading screens so near-instant. It's also way less laggy than TS3 was in game.
*Sims can look way more different than each other. They can actually look like different races. There's a bit of a learning curve with making adjustments in CAS (create-a-sim), but it really pays off if you like to have more variety in Sim appearances in your game. I've attached pictures of my first two Sims showcasing this. Namin is Korean, and Jynette is black. You can also change body types a lot, but I usually prefer to make thin-to-average-sized girls still.
*Multi-tasking is a nice little convenience. It's usually best for talking to other Sims while doing other things (such as cooking or painting), but there are some other uses as well. My picture of Namin shows her having two drinks at once.
*Ghosts are the color of their current emotion and have different abilities depending on how they died. I have not yet tested whether there are ghost babies in TS4.
*There are better buy and build-mode tools as well.
*I recommend downloading a faster gardening mod. You can get one from modthesims.
*There's too much other good stuff in this game to go on about, you can buy it and discover for yourself, or find a multitude of other information about it online.

I was nervous about buying the game when I did, because I heard negative things about it (mostly people complaining that it's not open-world), but once I played it, I loved it way more than I loved TS2 even, and that was my first Sims game. I hope this review was helpful to you. Good luck with your buying decision, and happy simming! :)"^4^October 12, 2014

BlackGirlsSimToo, ^27831445^105^4^"I've the game for over two years now and it's really fun! A lot of people dislike this newest installment of the Sims because of the many things that were there in the previous games, but didn't make it to this one. ex; toddlers, open world, create-a-style, etc. The game is still very enjoyable without these features,  the sims are more lively, have more emotions, and I feel more connected to them. In the Sims 3 the sims eyes were lifeless. I think that many teenagers will enjoy this game. I would recommend buying this for them, especially now on Black Friday.  With the addition of expansion packs like Get To Work the game is even more fun! The Sims 4 is a really fun game and very enjoyable. The only things I would say I dislike about the game is the loading screens. If you're someone coming from playing  The Sims 3 the loading screens might take a little adjusting to, other than that it's a very enjoyable game. If you want to know more information you can always go online and research, watch videos, read reviews, etc."^5^November 22, 2016
megadicegirl, ^27831445^96^75^"I have been playing the sims since I was twelve years old. I began playing with the original sims.
Sadly, all the hype was a massive let down! The sims 3 is a much better series than this. EA has went all the way back to the sims 1 with better graphics. Don't get me wrong, the layout like the bar or HUD is pleasing but I honestly can't see what they spent most of there time on. EA has stripped away everything that made the sims charming. There is absolutely nothing for your sims to do. There is no activities, no community lots that are worth any entertainment. There isn't even graveyards! Basically your sims sit in their homes, go to work without you or go jogging. When you throw a party, there's nothing for them to do other than listen to the radio or watch TV. Word of advice, go through origin.com they have a refund policy, if you are so eager to try the sims 4."^1^September 5, 2014
Mariah5SOS, ^27831445^79^5^"I'm gonna be honest, I'm obsessed with Dan and Phil Games on Youtube. So much so that, I literally bought this game to play vicariously through my own custom sim(s). The only problem? I am now addicted. I would recommend!"^5^January 10, 2017
GrannySleuth, ^27831445^69^47^"I almost wasn't going to write this review. This does not reflect on Walmart.

I feel like I'm testing a game in Beta release, not yet completed. I might have been okay with this purchase if the game had cost about $20.00 or even as much as $40.00.

It's just so bare-bones. Forget about building a decent house.

And the glitches. Good God. Have you seen what the babies look like with their eyes spearing out from their skulls???

EA made a big deal about how these new Sims would have emotions, but isn't jealousy an emotion? My Sim's husband was woohooing right in front of her, and she didn't even react!!!

Nope. I'm returning the game. I bought it locally, and if Walmart isn't allowed to refund the money, then I'll make EA do it.

After Sim City, I should have known better."^1^September 4, 2014
RobertaMae, ^27831445^68^9^"I think many people coming off the Sims 3 with all its content from expansions were blindsided by the lack of content that is in Sims 4.

For me, being a stand alone game, I am loving it. I have over a hundred hours in and still not have done a lot of the stuff in it.

There are goals to be met to unlock stuff. Some people don't like this. The feel it is too RPGish for them. I enjoy unlocking the items and achieving the goals. If you don't, they have cheats for that.

I have not had a crash.

Bugs??? What bugs? If they mean clipping(where a sim walks through another sim or an item such as a couch), I would much have that than the Sims 3 way dealing with something in the way, which would be cancelling action and standing there stomping their foot.
I have had a fork get stuck on a sim.( Easily fixed by going into CAS)

Emotions are really fun to play with. Whatever mood they are in, you can really see it in their expressions. There are different actions available depending on their moods.

CAS is so much fun. Some of the Star sims that players have made are so spot on. You can download them to your game.

Build mode is amazing. If you have any bit of a creative streak in ya. You will be building for hours. If you don't like to build, they have many pre-builts and stylized rooms to choose from. Also, some of the houses built by players will blow you away. They also can be downloaded and put into your game. My only wish for build mode would be automatic roofs.

Hours and hours of fun.

Reason for not giving it five stars....anything can have room for improvement."^4^September 25, 2014
ParentsWhoCare, ^27831445^58^8^"I got this game for my thirteen year old son's birthday. I was a little worried about the T rating however when I did my research I was relieved to see it hardly deserved a T rating. The T rating comes from only a few things including, beating up a sim (in a cloud of dust so it can't be seen), using the bathroom (pixels cover everything.), and using the shower and again pixels cover it. So parents, don't deny your child a pleasurable (maybe even a bit educational) experience. You're kids will be glad you got this."^5^October 26, 2014

ohempton, ^27831445^46^35^"Don't waste your money buying this game. This game has less of everything than even the basic version of Sims 3, which severely limits the increased in graphics and character improvements. It comes with two worlds which come with a total of 17 lots in each world, including already used lots for places like parks, gyms, etc. Houses have a total of 12 lots, with 4 unbuilt lots. A huge decrease from Sims 3 and greatly inhibits growth and generational play.

Don't waste your time with this game until several expansions have come out, then if you want to shell out over $100 for the game and expansions, then go for it. But right now, stick with Sims 3"^1^September 4, 2014
^27831445^30^10^"Sims 4 has been a while coming, and I wasn't excited at first. I wasn't going to play the game until I'd heard from someone else if it was worthwhile, because I'd heard a ton about it, and I was wary of the changes. After it came out, I immediately started hearing good things, and impulsively bought Sims 4 from my local Walmart, keeping a firm grasp on my return policy receipt.
Boy, was I surprised.
Laptop mode runs beautifully on my 2 year old laptop, without completely destroying the graphics. I've experienced almost no glitches or lagging, even when my Sims' house is full of guests. The routing problems have all but disappeared, and the new CAS and Build/Buy modes are beautiful.
Of course, with all the positives, some things have changed. There are WAY fewer lots to move into, as most of them are full and there are only a few empty build lots in each world. The community lots are lacking, and there is no open world. If you aren't interested in your Sims being extremely active hosts to a gaggle of individual friends, this might not be the game for you.
Overall, the new social system and multi-tasking abilities are a huge improvement, but there are few lots, and the community lots are a bit boring if you're used to the hustle and bustle of Sims 3's Bridgeport. Still, worth a try if you're a casual Sims fan who wants an improvement on the lagging, glitching, awkward Sims of generations past."^4^September 10, 2014

the create a sim improvements are extraordinary, especially the bella & Mortimer goth, we've seen them at different stages from sims till sims 4, dee latest.

TimoL14, ^27831445^7^2^"Having been an avid player of Sims 2 and Sims 3 I decided to buy the Deluxe Edition when it came out for my wife and I (we play on separate computers in the same room when we do it).

My first reactions were, 'Wow the graphics are significantly better,' and, 'oh this user design flow is really nice and the genetic feature is pretty nifty.' After that though everything seemed to just go down hill from there for me.

The first thing that bothered me was the lot size. You really don't have an opportunity to have too many sims living near each other because there is a very small amount of room where you can build homes / businesses and after a few test runs you'll quickly find yourself out of room and needing to go to another neighborhood.

The second thing was really just the fact it didn't feel fun to manage this sim's life versus previous games. People grow up way too quickly so I end up not having enough time to really live the life. I'm playing a video game not some sort of inheritance simulator where you have to build up a family from rags to riches through the generations.

I just wish the magic of Sims 2 and 3 was there where I felt like I could make my character into whatever I wanted (a famous artist, etc) without watching the other aspects of their life crumble because I was focused on a goal. I found if I wanted to get my character to the highest tiers I had to pretty much 1) invite lady friend over to talk while he works, 2) fit a shower in after completing said work somehow, 3) hope lady friend will clean the house for him while he falls asleep from exhaustion, and then 4) begin the whole flow again; I feel like having my Sim succeed in this iteration is more of a chore. It'd have been survivable for me if the loading screens weren't everywhere and so slow which kills the environment but unfortunately they're terrible.

I get how this can be fun to some people but as a legacy Sims user I just really don't get it. Maybe it's just me so take this with a grain of salt but I think EA really lost the mark here. There's fun to be had in the game just not by me."^2^November 21, 2015

The color wheel is no longer there and the options for the camera was almost unusable so I ended up using the Sims 3 camera anyways. Not having the color wheel and being able to customize certain things definitely takes away from the game but the graphics are pretty awesome the people are more realistic so I gave them two thumbs up for that. Hopefully on the Sims 5 they will take basically everything from Sims 3 and the improved Graphics from 4 and put them together.

I literally play for hours at a time!!"^1^November 1, 2015
Kletus4Ever, ^43816066^83^8^"I didn't exactly have low hopes for Sims 4's first expansion, but I didn't expect it to be as fun as it is. I'm one of the types that has to mention I've been playing the Sims since the very first one. (Sorry) But I mention it because since the very beginning, Sims fans have always wanted to control their working sims at that Sim's job. We finally get to do this and it could have turned out annoying or bad, but didn't.

If you didn't know, there are three controllable careers, plus you can open your own business and control it. I'll admit that's not much, but anyone that's played an EA game knows that they'll milk our wallets for expansions. But don't hold that against The Sims. It's like that will all games these days.

I won't reveal too much about Get To Work, but I will say a few things. The careers you can control are medical, scientist, and detective (if you didn't know this yet). Just like when you go on dates in the base game, with this you have objectives you can achieve at that Sim's job. You don't have to if you don't want to. If you want, you can just play around with stuff at their job. You can even do construction at your workplace and edit the building or grounds. Or you can achieve the goals they give you which will help you get promoted faster.

Now remember I said things could have been worse, but turned out great? One example is that you don't HAVE TO follow your sim to work if you don't want to. If you'd rather focus on another sim from that family you can. If you don't follow your sim to work, then it's just like it always has been where the sim's work performance will depend on their mood. So you don't have to controll them at their job if you would rather play another sim from that lot at their job, or doing something else. I like that.

I also like how I can load up another lot and be a customer at the other lot's job. Like I could open a business as one sim, then later playing another lot, I could go visit that same business and be it's customer. I didn't expect that.

There's a ton of new items for our sims' homes-- more furniture, decorations, more interections, etc. They improved existing interactions that came with the base game. Many new improvements to the existing stuff.

I found that I was playing the game a lot more often after I had gotten this expansions. There's only a few complaints and they're very minor complaints. One is that I hate launchers. I hate having to load stuff before I can load the game. Another complaint is that when you're controlling a sim at their job, the very second their work day ends, the game automatically loads up their home lot again. You can't stay late at their job and finish a task or mess around with stuff. I hate being kicked off the work lot the second the work shift ends. My final complaint is the price of the expansion. I agree that it is overpriced. I blame Electronic Arts for that, not the Sims creators.

But as I said, these are minor complaints. The expansion is still a lot of fun and improves Sims 4. Personally, I'd recommend buying the disc version and not a digital download. If you ever have to reinstall the game, you won't have to wait for the long download that would have to take place before the actual reinstall.

If you've ever liked the Sims, you'll like this. You just have to give it a chance and actually play it so you can see Sims 4 is the best one yet."^5^April 13, 2015
BlackGirlsSimToo, ^43816066^9^1^"I've had Get to Work for about a year now, and what I can say is that it is a good addition to the base game. Your sims now have active careers and your able to follow your sims to work and complete tasks with them. You also can run your own store or business. You get the new photography skill, baking skill, and many other interactions. When I first bought the game I was very impressed and I had loads of fun playing with it during the first couple of months. After a while, taking your sims to work became boring. The tasks you have to repeat are very repetitive, this expansion can lose it's new game shine very quickly if you aren't into repeating things. You get a lot of new clothes, hair, and makeup in Create a Sim so that's a plus. They also have an alien life state, your male sims can even get pregnant with an alien baby! That was very fun to play with. I would recommend getting this expansion, but also look into getting Get Together so you can add something more once you get bored of this one. Overall is a good expansion adds something fresh to the base game, but can get boring after you've done all the careers."^4^November 22, 2016

The fact that nowhere on the packing does the game state you have to join steam before you can play it on your own PC offline is inexcusable.

Downers: Memory HOG. I have 8GB on board (max for my older system) but still received low memory warnings. I was able to win a match on Chieftain without any real issues, but it crashed when I tried a mod match on Warlord. I found that my page file was quite small so I raised it to 8GB virtual RAM.

In this expansion pack, it comes with a new town called 'Starlight Shores'. It is like Hollywood, CA because it has the big sign in the hills. You can be a magician, a singer, or an acrobat. These careers are so much more involved than the regular careers. It comes with plenty of cute clothing for both men and women. And some pretty cute hairstyles. There even is this little bunny costume you can create your sim with. Starlight Shores also comes with some nice(and BIG) houses. I have no problem with it so far, and I definitely recommend it."^5^March 30, 2013

They are worth it, though in the end if you want to buy all expansion packs for sims 3 (not all have been released yet, a lot more still to come) you will end up paying around a total of $400.00 (if you are lucky).

meb101, ^16793184^16^49^"this Game only works if you have a certain speed. i got this for christmas and was sooo excited to set it up and i downloaded it and i tried playing it and it froze. i need a big enough processer NOT GOOD EA GAMES SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT MORE CLEAR TO THE PUBLIC. not impressed"^1^December 25, 2011
Nightfeathers, ^16793184^14^6^"The Sims series is one that I have long enjoyed. Last Christmas when I was looking around for something to get myself, it didn't take me long to decide. I had been enjoying the Sims 2 for quite some time, so I decided to upgrade. I bought the combination of the base Sims3 as well as this expansion and one other.

Gameplay itself is much improved. I quite like the additional features, yet it still retained the familiarity of the Sims 2. The base game works just fine on my computer with no issues and very little lag.

Then came the Pets. I was very excited about this part of the game, because you finally get to control the pets the way you can the Sims themselves. It sounded like an amazing upgrade, so as soon as Christmas came I eagerly installed and updated my game, only to suffer extreme disappointment.

Visit Youtube and you can readily find videos of the kind of distortion I was dismayed to find occurring in my game. It only seems to effect the pets themselves, and only the cats, dogs, and horses at that. They simply don't render properly. Their images are horridly distorted such that one cannot even tell the species until a sound effect gives it away. Often some body parts will float some distance away or be turned around backwards altogether!

It is impossible to enjoy playing with pets that look more like the result of a nuclear attack. I can't use what was one of my main motivations for playing the game. For the first few months, owners of the Sims Pets expansion, many of whom were suffering as I was, were led to believe there would be a patch. I had faith that this was true, and during this time bought the Sims Medieval as well.

As it turns out, we were lied to. EA Games now says that it is not their problem, and refuse to fix this glitch. My only option is to turn to third party software, or just not play an expansion I have already paid $30 to get! There is a third party solution out there too, so I know it is not just our computers. EA Games is being completely irresponsible and ignoring the needs of consumers of what is probably their most popular product. Sadly because of this I will not be buying anything more from them until I can see for sure that it works properly, and I will definitely never buy until the cost goes down. I, for one, cannot afford to throw away another $30-40 on a product the company will not even ensure is working properly."^1^July 21, 2012

candace2004, ^16793184^7^17^"I love animals and I thought this would be a good one to add to my sims 3 but it barely gives you anything! you get cats, dogs, and horses with very little to pick from to buy for them. There are other animals but they aren't as interactive as cats, dogs, and horses. The expansion is not worth 30$ and I'm not buying any others until they come down. I like sims 2 more anyway."^2^April 4, 2012
vamperus, ^16793184^5^7^"EA was not ready to release Sims 3 Pets, there is a glitch where every 3-5 seconds the characters freeze but the water and sound continues. Then after about 2 minutes it will unfreeze only to freeze again in a few seconds. EA told me to uninstall and reinstall, that did nothing, I have a lot of space on my computer, and the video card is new, and my computer was bought a year ago. EA will also say it is because I have a MAC, but I have a PC with Windows 7.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The glitch is from the CD not my computer, the newest patch didn't fix it. I took it back to Wal-Mart for an exchange, still no luck so tomorrow I will be Getting a refund. Just do a search on Google for pets 3 freezing if you don't believe me."^1^April 21, 2012

bobafett, ^48174527^1^7^"Cons
1)This game lacks rewarding experience. Rewards include weapons that are close in stats. You get to unlock appearance of stormtrooper and rebel soldier, which are hair and face only until you reach level 40. You don't get to choose Tie fighter pilot look until level 50.
2) It takes way to long to level up. 2 weeks playing every day got to level 11 out of 50.
3) Not able to choose Rebels or Empire when in multiplayer battles. The Game picks for you. This could be good and or bad depending on your likes.

Pros
1) If you just want to run around as a Random star wars rebel or stormtrooper and shoot each other without getting worthwhile rewards then go for it.
2)Cool Weapons
3) Cool multiplayer planetary air craft battles. xwing awing tie fighters. so far doesn't have space battles. as far as i know.
4)can use at at walker if you get the power up during battles."^2^January 21, 2016

c1staff, ^37147040^2^2^"While my husband enjoys the game, he has mentioned that it's a bit difficult to maneuver the plans around (controls sensitivity is a bit low). It also took him a while to figure out switch between the bombs and missiles. Apparently, the jets would switch to other types of ammo, but would not fire them. Not sure how he's doing it now though. He's definitely more into Rome right now so he'll play this when he gets bored of Rome, which is very rare.

Setup of the game was also difficult. It took us a while to figure it out. Thank goodness for Google. We had Steam set up on the computer already because he plays other games, but the game would not run. A little 'Battlestations' window would pop up on the top left hand corner, stay there for a little bit and then disappear. It turns out that you need a Live.com account to make it work. As soon as that had been set up, the game worked for us."^4^October 9, 2014

TMfan88, ^5272734^1^6^"I have played wow since about 2 months after its release. And the expansion since the night of its release. In the beginning wow was a very very awsome experience. Your enemy would raid your cities and towns and you would do the same to them. The first pvp experience I had I will never forget. But........wow is not like it used to be. The best way I can describe this is the game is 20% fun and 80% grind and frustration. I have defeated every piece of content the burning crusade xpac has to offer ( yes that means i've killed illidan many times) And I will admit I had alot of fun but I've also felt like everytime I go to raid I'm doing a job that I dont want to do. The battleground option of the game is very fun about half the time. But most of the time you will find yourself on the opposite end of a 10 man team destroying you while the rest of your team is afk or they just arent trying to win. The pvp is very very imbalanced between all the classes making some of the classes WAYYYY overpowered compared to other classes even if you in the best gear ingame.
If your looking for a fun game I would suggest looking elswhere. WoW at one time was a blast but now that has faded. Everytime you log on you will feel as if your going to work instead of logging on to have fun. This game is a waste of time and I feel bad that I've spent hundreds of dollars just to go to work and have a few moments of fun here and there. It costs about $180.00 to play this game yearly ontop of the 50-60 dollar cost of buying new xpacs. Be warned"^1^December 5, 2007

It is a remake of the first video game in the series, the original 1996 Tomb Raider.

The game was co-developed by Crystal Dynamics and Buzz Monkey Software for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2, Windows and Wii.[4] Eidos announced 1 June 2007 as the European release date for the PS2 and Windows version, with the North American release to follow on 5 June 2007.[5][6] Additionally, the subscription PC gaming service GameTap announced that the game will be available on their service on the same day as the game went to retailers.[7] The PSP version was released on 9 August 2007 in the United States and on 26 October 2007 in Europe, with the Wii version released in Europe on 7 December 2007.[8] An Xbox 360 version was released on 23 October 2007[9] and a version for the PlayStation 3 is included in The Tomb Raider Trilogy collection released in March 2011.[10] The Mac OS X version of the game was released in February 2008 by Feral Interactive.[1]

The game was well received by critics, with the PC version holding the highest score. It holds an 83 on Metacritic and 84.28% on GameRankings. The game sold 2.3 million copies worldwide.[11]"^3^June 15, 2015

Pakka, ^4346781^1^0^"I've looked forward to this game for years, and right now I'm frustrated by a small display and sub-par Video card. Its not the games fault.

This is a Really great game, and there always seems to be a new twist or use of equipment I had not tought of to keep your production / resources balanced.

Even with the Con's above this is the game you want if your like strategy games. Just make sure your computer equipment is beefy, and that you have a lot of free time :)"^4^December 24, 2007

Ahumblereviewer, ^42496713^3^26^"A number of people who already own Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn and have pre-ordered this game, Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward - an expansion of A Realm Reborn - have complained about encountering numerous problems in redeeming the pre-order bonus code to gain early access to this game.

I, myself, pre-ordered the PC download collector's edition of this game and had to immediately return it for a full refund because the pre-order bonus code I received and redeemed at Square Enix's official website gave me the wrong registration code. I received a Mac registration code instead of the Windows registration doe - even though I bought the Windows version of Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward. I already own the Windows and PS4 versions of its predecessor, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.

Support by the manufactuer constitutes a major portion of the overall quality of a game, especially for a MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) one like Final Fantasy XIV. Sadly, Square Enix, failed badly here for this game, at least for me. Your experience may be different."^1^June 21, 2015

Mashidar, ^2432482^31^3^"World of Warcraft is without a doubt one of the biggest hits for the MMORPG world in many years. With over 11 Million subscribers it's hard to think there's anything that will topple the giant that is WoW.

Yet there is a good reason why they are the best at what they do because they not only give a polished product upon release, but they are able to target both the hardcore player and the casual player. They can target the Player vs Player, PvP, crowd as well as the Player vs Enviroment, PvE, crowd.

This is the 2nd expansion in the World of Warcraft series and allows you to travel to Northrend to battle against The Lich King Arthas. Northrend is a level 68+ area so you must have someone leveled at least that high to travel to the new realm.

If you have someone above level 55 then you can create the new Hero Class known as a Death Knight. As someone who has a level 70 Warrior at the moment I can tell you that I spent the first few hours of the release playing a Death Knight, DE, and found myself enjoying the new combat style of the death knight as well as playing a class that could tank things without a shield. If you do pick up the expansion I suggest you give this shot a try, at least to play the new intro for the class and learn how this class came about into the lore of the WoW Universe.

Overall there are many improvements on all fronts that make this title a great pick up for fans of the series that have already been playing for awhile. If you have yet to level someone above level 55 then there might not be much for you at the moment to enjoy."^5^November 14, 2008
rwh531, ^2432482^18^43^"I started playing world of warcraft in late 2004 it was a good game back then that required a huge time investment and was very addictive.

I bought this expansion pack the day it was released and it has utterly destroyed the game the player vs player system is not balanced while the player vs environment aka raiding has become a bunch of mindless dribble that is not in the least bit challenging.

Furthermore this game is not kid friendly their are quests that refer to women as Ho's , others that promote killing yourself conjuring the dead and just all forms of demonic rituals.

The game it self is very laggy and randomely freezes as it is full of bugs many of the players class abilities do not work correctly if at all.

Also the class Balancing is so bad that many of the classes are just not wanted in groups because they perform poorly compared to other classes."^1^December 24, 2008
Vancetechnology, ^2432482^18^1^"i work hard on a road construction crew, and ive been playing WoW for over 3 years now, this expansion is great, the death knight is an awesome class to play, northrend is a great area, not as cool as outland, but still great. raiding is ok...not nearly as challenging as it was in vanilla and burning crusade, but still fun, the change in difficulty will allow casual players to see more content."^4^August 11, 2009
MScottPaperCompany, ^2432482^10^3^"This expansion was a nice addition to WoW but is still lacking in many areas in my opinion. The Death Knights are a very cool class and have been performing great in raids whether they are specced for DPS or Tanking. Northrend is a nice new continent but at the same time by the time you hit level 76 and still have 4 to go you are going to be so bored of the endless grind that you will never want to set foot in Northrend again. Just way too much XP to level in my opinion. Overall decent though and the game has become more casual player friendly with raids like Naxx10, Obsidian sanctum etc. 4 out of 5 stars."^4^September 12, 2009

Nuada75, ^2432482^8^2^"I'm must say I'm very satisfied with the newest expansion pac for World of Warcraft. The detail is amazing and the over all game is awsome and at times hilarious. I preordered the game for the Nov.13th release and received it on Nov.17th with just regular shipping. I have yet to be dissatisfied with any of my orders from Walmart.com"^5^November 19, 2008
RichardInPA, ^2432482^4^0^"Let me start by saying; This expansion is much better than 'Burning Crusade', for anyone wondering.

This is an additional expansion module for the original game, 'World of Warcraft' or 'WoW'. The entire game is a great value for the money, even with the modest $15/mo fee to play online, which is necessary to play the game.

The original game, and 'Burning Crusade' are also required. So, unless you have those already, I suggest starting with the original World of Warcraft game, then adding the expansions. You will get months of play time before these are necessary to continue.

I would not personally recommend 'WoW' for anyone under age. The game does have some moral merit, although many of those concepts are actually a little complicated for a child to comprehend and it is too easy for an unsupervised child to take the wrong course of action without consequence. It also contains violence, and interaction with other players that provide a host of bad examples for children. The other problem with it for young children is that it takes a tremendous amount of time to accomplish anything, and will interfere with their responsibilities, such as homework and chores.

On the other hand, I highly recommend this game for anyone between the ages of 18 and 100. My mother plays at the age of 83. She has been playing for over 5 years now and loves it! It provides her with hours of entertainment without leaving the comfort of her desk chair. This includes social interaction, since the game is played via online connection to thousands of other players.

These are my personal opinions of the game and do not reflect the intent of the makers, nor are they designed to interfere with sales. I enjoy the game myself and endorse it for what I consider the proper age groups.

Buy it, dive in, and enjoy! It's a lot of fun and well worth the money considering the months and years of play you will get for it!"^5^September 7, 2010

NY11725, ^2432482^1^0^"I've been playing world of warcraft since vanilla.... I have a Zulian Tiger along with other epic items. I took a break when Wrath first came out, but now last month bought it. I feel questing areas are a lot of fun, with the random annoying quests...dungeons seem to be fun..only issue I have is...a lot of the new players seem to not know what they are doing, and its very frustrating to where I will sometimes log out and take a break.

I leveled my Druid from 70 to 80 in like 5 days, and now am 72 on my rogue. So, leveling isn't that bad, and is actually quite some fun. Gold rains in which is nice. I can't wait to play Cat and start doing end game again. Some people said this expansion blew, but I don't feel it did...you won't know how you feel until you try it for yourself.

I feel the price was weird at $40 when Cat is $40. I feel this expansion should of well been $19.99. Not because it blew....which it doesn't..but just because you can't charge full price for a old expansion when it's already been outdated by a newer expansion..but that is Blizzard for you :P

Nitrobacter, ^2432482^0^2^"I was very excited when this came out. The death knights are awesome, as are the dk-specific quests. However, I was quite disappointed that I could only make 1 dk per server w/a preexisting level 55+. Despite what many forums say, you have to have a 55+ on every server you want to make a dk on, not just one 55+ for the whole account. I would like to make more deathknights to try the different talent trees, but I don't have time to make a 55 on multiple servers! Another problem with this is that it is very, very glitchy. Someone in general chat said it should be called 'Wrath of the Glitch King', and I agree. Hopefully Blizz will fix this soon, but they have a big job ahead of them... the experience is fun, but could be much better.

Its a good game for those who like MMOs, and the amount of playable content is defitely respectable, but as getting the original, plus burning crusade and this expansion is equal to a $60-$80 start-up fee, and comes with no free play time. The next expansion is also expected to come out in just 2 months, so none of the content of this expansion will be played anymore as soon as the new one is released.

BrBlack, ^10930389^10^16^"Beautiful Game. Graphics are nice, in game sounds give me a chuckle. However for the following reasons, i did not enjoy this game.

*Can not set difficulty level.
*Can not play computer oponents. only campaigns and single missions available besides online oponents or lan with friends.
*I can only complete the tutorial and first couple Campaigns. Rest are all advanced.
*Sewers and Graveyards (Appear in your city and can not be destroyed) constantly pound you with rats and skeletins before you even get a foothold.
*Enemies are so close, once you start building anything, fog of war opens up revealing an enemy spawn location, and they come in non stop.
*Some missions say 'Stay away from the enemy till your strong enough' While your peasents run up and start building houses 10 miles out of your city in enemy territory.
*Can't zoom out very far.
*Can't Make money fast enough vs how many mobs constantly come in.
*Some levels enemies just come from off screen and walk right into your town and attack. They keep coming, can't destroy their spawn point.
*Price of buildings are doubled every time you build. So making enough towers for defence is just not possible.
*You can only make 3 units per building. And you need to upgrade each building and all of their spells as far as i can tell.
*Feels cramped, everything so close together.

dejaemikey, ^21365541^19^4^"i would strongly recommend that if you are purchasing game off walmart.com and picking up in store that you CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE SEAL IS INTACT...we had to take the first game back after the code was missing, the second because the code had already been used...other than that the new game is fantastic!"^5^December 10, 2012
ADHDrules, ^21365541^12^9^"honestly i used to love world of craft i loved raiding and getting gear but i personally believe that they have dumbed it down so much a 9 year old can play it the leveling system is so easy and theirs no personality to your character there used to be a talent tree where you could put points in now theirs just a couple spells to pick from that corresponds to your class specs its in my eyes horrible. i love a game that's not to hard and not to easy well world of Warcraft is just to easy a buddy of mine completely leveled up a toon of his in 2 weeks i want a game that makes me work a little bit and the only thing to do after you cap your level is get rep with factions which gets old really fast or player vs player games where if your not equipped right you die every five seconds. so honestly if you want a fun easy game buy WOW. but if you want a game that's a little difficult and fun play something else."^3^May 26, 2013
Nights, ^21365541^11^3^"If you are looking at this, you probably are or are shopping for a seasoned WoW player. This is probably the best expansion pack ever released. The additional features, playable classes, new lands and raid content will entertain for months. Because Blizzard constantly updates, adding new content and always making the game more challenging, its an excellent value for the money.

As the previous reviewer noted, NEVER buy a used game and ALWAYS ensure the box seals are intact. The game its self is free for download online, but to unlock the content you need the unique code that will be in the box. If the code is missing or used, the product is useless and needs to be returned."^5^December 17, 2012
mopisbad, ^21365541^8^27^"This is by far the worst expansion yet. It took away all the talent trees and everything a lot of us loved about wow.

Kerdomrikman, ^21365541^2^1^"Whereas I shop Walmart and have for many years, I have to say that this item is currently well overpriced at $34.96. It is currently (and has been for a long time) priced only $19.99 at the Blizzard online store. Blizzard will often offer it at 1/2 off the $19.99 price.

As for the game itself, it's WoW, either ya love it or ya don't! I've been playing since the release of Burning Crusade. The game has changed a lot over the years and this expansion (Mists of Pandaria) has made the game far too easy....there's little to no challenge anymore. I still play WoW daily but I've reduced my game to the free (trial) version. In my opinion it's just not worth paying a monthly fee to play the upper content. Hopefully the next expansion will return some difficulty to the game."^3^March 11, 2014

fulish, ^5272748^1^0^"This is exactly what I expected, actually it's worse. It holds some challenging aspects, but I dont recommend this product.

PHOENIXGAMERPS4PRO, ^52664456^10^0^"I have played all resident evil games, and for me the best horror one is Resident Evil 2, I thought there were never going to ever create a similar game to R2 again since shinji mikami is not part of the team anymore since resident evil 4, he did realease a game called THE EVIL WITHIN pretty decent. , but this game R7! goes back to the classic horror music and scaring you all of the sudden when you don't expected. I also like the fact that the dead bodies dont just disappear, they actually remain in the floor , this makes it more real like r2. I really believe this game is one of the more scariest games  I ever played. I used VR headset and it is so scary having monsters right in front of your face in 3D.  I am glad they still know that this type of game is what people want, not the boring action  stuff from resident evil 5 and  6. I rate this game 5 STARS."^5^June 16, 2017

IsThisTheKrustyKrab, ^44911580^30^7^"This is what it comes down to...
The rating, as stated, is mature. If you do not like gore there is the option to take it off but if that's not enough I don't know what to tell you, this game is not for 'weak minded' on the gore aspect of the game (especially campaign). Anyways apart from that, the shipping was great, installing the game to my PS4 took a while (because of the amount of space it took), but overall I've been loving every second I have the chance to play it. There is so many things to unlock and challenges to accomplish in Zombies, Campaign and Multiplayer. Graphics are alright, considering I'm on the PS4, and the game play jumps no new boundaries but is very fun nonetheless. Would I recommend this? Heck yeah. Would I Buy this for you if you had any doubts about this game? absolutely, nah JK. On the ++ side of things though, the price isn't 60$ anymore :D"^5^December 9, 2015

I understand a no pause feature for online play, but no pause for local split screen play is just horrible on the eyes, intestines and bladder.  Oh, and good luck having a zombie baby sitter ... they spawn randomly so ... ouch! The zombie map is terrific, but me and my family are hard core zombie players so we need a 'pause' for required human breaks."^2^December 29, 2017

Steven, ^52730202^8^91^"Ruined it plain and simple. Turned a once great serious in Dark Souls clone trash. Dozens of enemies who deal massive damage in every encounter? Check.  A worthless weapon that can only deal with one enemy at a time while all the others gang up on you? Check. Well at least Dark Souls has a decent dodge mechanic.  In this you roll about a foot in any direction, but all enemies have about a 3 foot attack range in every direction. So useless.  Gone is the fast paced fun combat, now it is slow, boring, and unfair at most times.  Better off saving your money and getting Dark Souls 3 for $40 cheaper."^1^April 21, 2018

However, it's not a run-in and spray bullets. You have to think. Finding bullets isn't the easiest thing to do. What gun do I use? You have to craft survival items.

I eventually dished out the money just to play this exclusive title on the PS3 along with other naughty dog games. IE; Uncharted Series. It was 100% worth it. Fast forward to the next-gen consoles and I managed to win a PS4. Now what games do I own for it? Uncharted Remastered, Uncharted 4, and The Last of Us Remastered. Honestly, TLoU is one of the best games on the market, and definitely very high in my top 10 overall games in the history of history.

DBizzle, ^51747225^38^22^"lol this game is more of the same futuristic garbage that we have all hated on for a few years now! Can't believe these developers haven't learned to listen to the fans yet and keep making the same thing we all DON'T want over and over again every year! ...I HIGHLY recommend saving your money, there are many other WAY better games out right now! Please don't feed into this garbage franchise anymore until they start fixing this nonsense they are giving us year after year now! ...Coming from a once diehard COD fan that played since COD 4, COD was the only game I ever played back in the day but these games continue to go farther and farther down hill every year! SAVE YOUR MONEY! Buy TitanFall 2 or Battlefield 1....they are both light years ahead of this terrible attempt at a fps!"^1^November 28, 2016
Christian, ^51747225^21^11^"The thing about this game, is that there are many jetpacks and more of a futuristic type of shooting game. If you do not like the more futuristic type of games with jetpacks and guns, I recommend you not to purchase this game. Find a more older game that you enjoy like, Battlefield 1. My opinion on this game is that I dont really like the jetpacks on this game but otherwise I enjoy this game. I purchased this game in the version of Legacy Edition. This game is good in my opinion and I hope you do too."^4^November 13, 2016
Xavier, ^51747225^19^11^"Infinite warfare is a poorly designed game. Do not buy it this year. Juat go look at all the real reviews on the internest instead of the one best buy scrubs to try and sell more copies.

Redeamer, ^53966157^46^15^"Skyrim definiatly needed a hd remaster. Id recomend it. The reason why im writing the review for this is that the other reviewer is a little off with mod support. Sony isn't allowing mod support as of yet. Bethesda is working on a way for ps4 users to get mod support despite sonys wishes, and they plan on bringing mod support when sony changes their mind. Until then, bethesda said that they will have some sort of mod support but not fullblown like xbox one or pc... yet."^4^September 20, 2016

The last game had a bunch of online issues and didn't have any other modes which were overly good. Also the first game didn't even have story mode. Only issue can be season passes which every first person shooters apparently has nowadays. But the overall product isn't reduced because of it. Eventually the content becomes cheaper and even free at some occasions as time goes on. Overall it's worth a try especially if you're tired of playing Call of duty and Battlefield all the time."^5^November 11, 2017
Garrigus01, ^55702532^7^0^"No matter how much you love Star Wars (and I LOVE Star Wars), this travesty by EA should be avoided at all costs.  Under it's shiny visuals and enticing premise lies a game built to milk you out of the maximum amount of cash possible.

When I download a free cellphone game, I expect it to have in-app purchases, it's par for the course.  When I pay $60-$80 for a full price retail game, I don't expect to be bombarded with DLC, Micro-transactions and the equivalent of online gambling with the loot crate scheme.  

Even more egregious is the fact that the game is blatantly PAY TO WIN.  You can spend thousands of hours (no joke) to unlock all of the hero characters, or spend real money on loot crates for a chance to unlock them.  And speaking of loot crates, people willing to spend the cash can level their characters up to unbeatable levels where they run around and completely decimate everybody who just wants to play the game they just spent $60-$80 for.

There is a reason that after only a month, the game has dropped $20 in price and it's NOT because it's a 'best-seller.'  It's because people are wising up and avoiding this train wreck.

Speak with your wallet and don't be a sheep.  If you are willing to continue to pay for these money-grubbing schemes, the likes of EA and Activision will continue to milk you of your hard earned cash."^1^January 7, 2018

Weaver, ^55702532^4^32^"OHH MY!! What a wonderful game. DICE did an excellent job with the graphics, gameplay, and the story line! Bought this game at about 7PM on 11/17/17.
Ended up playing the campaign until 5AM 11/18/17.
Pulled an all nighter cause I had to open my store at 7AM.
for people that follow star wars and are HUGE fans, the campaign is for you. this game will answer questions never answered in the history of star wars! Now be carful cause it also will leave you with soooo many questions, that I assume will be answered when The Last Jedi comes out 12/15/17.
Other people looking for a high action game. its a mix between DICE's Battlefield 1 and Naughty Dog's Uncharted. in the campaign you will play as many of the main charters from episode 1 to episode 7. I don't want to spoil anything for you. The flight system they put in this game is amazing! you will end up flying most of the space craft star wars has to offer!
The campaign is not terribly long. but I can understand that with Disney owning star wars, I am sure there isn't much you can do that leads off the path Disney wants it to follow.

I would rate this game at 4 3/4 stars. its close to perfect but. perfect is impossible.
Highly recommend this game for everyone all ages.

CynicalCritic, ^55974664^6^2^"Whoa I did not expect such a great game to come out in January, but take that with a side of salt. Although it's a GREAT game it's for a specific kind of player. If you've played Warframe, The Division, or even that god awful mess called Destiny 2. Then you should feel right at home. Now what makes this a great game is the sense of progression. Not by level(which is called HR in the game) but by gear. You can only progress through gear or you could say 'screw it' and probably finish 20% of the story without upgrading anything. But since you progress through gear that incentives players to grind and hunt for monsters. Which is only enhanced when you play with your friends. So the mechanics and gameplay of this grindy game make it unique and enjoyable but if you came here wanting a story i suggest getting another game like The Witcher 3 or Dark Souls."^5^February 23, 2018

AGMHellfire, ^55652062^4^4^"Does NOT live up to the original. They have completely  taken a good platform and dumbed it down. You can't use the sharers more then once. Can't use the expansion packs until you have so many points for your clan and complete a list of milestone before moving forward with the Curse of Osiris. There are so many miss opportunities within this game it's pitiful. If I refund was offered I would happily accept it."^1^December 14, 2017

Frogay, ^55652062^3^0^"I have spent more than 1000 hours playing and I can't stop. The characters and the story line have improved greatly ever since the first one and I believe that the creators have outdone themselves this time. I really enjoy the fact that I can create up to 6 characters with their own separate skill trees and replay the game as many times as I want.  Handsome Jack is probably my most favorite villain in the whole gaming industry. Overall, Borderlands 2 is really awesome and I recommend it to anyone that likes RPGs, and FPS."^5^February 1, 2018
ENGDor101, ^55652062^1^0^"The gameplay in general and the idea of the game mechanics is brilliant. Even if only in terms of futuristic first person shooter.  The story mode as well is continually entertaining. The game managed to grab my attention, leaving me always wanting more. online factor are all outstanding with this game. Online allows you to play stong opponents, and connect with people around the world. In my honest opinion this game has surpassed its self over the years."^4^April 12, 2018

blurracer2010, ^25394877^78^9^"For those who have suffered through sub-par racing games when various consoles have launched, you won't have to do that with NFS: Rivals.

NFS: Rivals takes the best parts of NFS: Hot Pursuit and makes them better. You've got two distinct tracks to go (Cops and Racers# up to 60 ranks, and the game's map is open from the start. You progress by choosing and completing Speedlists. Some of them are very simply #'Bronze any Interceptor event'). Some, near the end, have 5-6 different requirements which all must be filled. Basically, the game will force you to try all the tech options and force you to be consistant if you want to unlock all it has to offer.

The newest edition to the series is AllDrive. This means that if you are playing single player and another driver is also playing single player, you games could literally MEET in the same place at the same time. You might be on an interceptor event and see a race blow by you, now it turns into a Hot Pursuit event! Busting human racers as a cop or getting away from a human cop definitely is the highlight of the title, as some epic cat-and-mouse games can happen.

Contrary to the other review, you CAN play offline and free roam just fine. There are 80+ jumps & 80 + speed cameras to find. There are no billboards or gates like in NFS: Most Wanted, so yes, if you're one of those perfectionists/play a game to death people, you might run through most of the content fairly quickly.

But if you need a next-gen racing game that runs butter smooth with no lag, that improves on one of the best NFS games ever released, then NFS: Rivals is an outstanding choice."^5^November 22, 2013
Yoda8123, ^25394877^50^6^"The game itself is fun but the multi player and forced registration with ORIGIN is absurd. I bought it on console to avoid these things. My second controller just collects dust now that I bought this game as there is no Split screen available. The 'multiplayer' in this games online mode is just about wrecking each other, not really a racing game when online, and anyone can interfere with your race. Makes in very hard to play with your friends or complete any event."^2^February 23, 2014

As It Should They made this Game & They half To Keep up With it to. I Wished Playing on line was Free But I Understand it cost Money & Time So I'm Ok With it. The Graphics Look Soo Real & The Cars Look & Sound Like Real Car's To. 5 Out Of 10 I Give It A 1000! So Much Fun & it's Not Like Playing A game it's like Driving In The Real World You Can Crash Your car Even Small Bump's Into A Guardrail Scratch your Paint. & They Have gas station's Where You can Fix Your Ride.

Misterman56, ^25185718^47^23^"I have been playing cod games for a while since they started making them and these last few years for me starting with MW3 i have disliked call of duty because it feels so repetitive to me. Like different maps and guns but everything else is the same. I feel it's not really the game it is that I don't enjoy the small maps and quick shoot em up which is what call of duty is. The only reason I bought the last call of duty, black ops 2 is because the zombies cause i don't enjoy the multiplayer anymore so this call of duty has no zombies if you didn't know and i think after playing this game for a little while I'm not gonna play it and go enjoy battlefield which i really enjoy or something else. so for conclusion call of duty is a good game and i enjoy the single player story mode a lot but the multiplayer is not something that i will keep playing for in the future."^3^November 17, 2013

Marleyn, ^25185718^34^20^"After playing COD Ghosts I was very disappointed. The reasons being that it feels very different from previous Call of duty games, and I have been playing COD since the very first game. Maps are huge with multiple levels and the action feels slow since its only 6 vs 6. After 4-5 hours of playtime I just could not find a reason to keep playing this game. In my experience COD is a game that is easy to play and difficult to master, with maps that are relatively small with 2-3 major routes and most action happening in the middle. On this COD the maps take away much of that action. Most people are either camping or/and sound listening (to put it in other words) due to these reasons. Overall it feels like a whole different shooter with the COD title slapped in the front. I wish I could return this game and get my money back."^1^November 27, 2013

valdxx, ^25185718^12^8^"We wanted the next phase of Call of Duty, but Ghosts really brings us more of the same old, same old. The premise is interesting but there's little sign of the promised guerrilla warfare feel, and while the changes to multiplayer are more convincing they don't necessarily make for a superior game. Ghosts is too polished, too well-paced and too spectacular to be called a disappointment, but it's stuck in the last generation when it should be helping to define a new one."^5^November 22, 2013
Thunder74, ^25185718^10^10^"This game rocks on the PS4. Earlier game glitches have been patched and repaired with the update. This game looks amazing on the PS4 running in 1080p. Everything runs smoother and faster on the 4. The offline game is well thought out and adds many new game playing roles. Flying helicopters and locking onto targets with the option of shooting missiles or spraying bullets while being locked onto by enemy choppers and having to launch anti missile flares all at the same time reaches a new level of difficulty and keeps you engaged in the game. I'm normally online only with COD games but this one has me playing the campaign daily. Be aware that in order to play Ghosts online (or pretty much all ps4 games) you will need a playstation plus membership. My copy of Ghosts came with a free trial of ps plus and it's well worth $50 a year. This game is much smoother and faster than the ps3 version."^5^January 3, 2014

As for the game engine, it hasn't changed much over the years, and they still focus on providing a great cinematic plot. Personally, I find it a great choice on Activision's part, because CoD is the FPS franchise I enjoy the most."^5^January 13, 2014

Zachary, ^41049186^80^19^"This game is just outstanding. They have everything you can possibly imagine - yachts, planes, helicopters, cars, blimps, weapons, and one amazing feature GTA 5 has is first person. The campaign is long and fun enough to play more than one time. GTA 5 online is balanced out to be fair enough to make you have a great time and enjoy leveling up. Grand Theft Auto online requires a lot of patience as well as needing to grind for money, but the missions are enjoyable, which makes grinding fun. Rockstar couldn't of made this game any better than it already is, though there are many updates which means MORE content. I 100% recommend this game to everybody who is interested in the GTA series."^5^January 10, 2016

Surprisingly great storyline, fun to follow the characters. Plenty to do in the open world, but still has main missions to keep you on track. Only negative is the long time it  takes to download onto the system. Best to leave it overnight, or plan on having something else to play while you wait. Definitely worth it, though."^5^August 26, 2016

Personally, I'm not into the whole criminal ethos of the series. Just doesn't appeal to me. The missions are redundant. You can't play the heist withour other people. So, you could be atuck on the planning phase forever. Some of the other people playing the game only want to cause chaos."^3^May 1, 2015

Scottacious, ^51269427^5^2^"This made my third time playing through both of these great games. I read many reviews saying that the graphics update was bad, but I thought it was on par with  current remasters. It is unfortunate that Arkham Origins is not included, but it is still great to get to play these two on my current gen console with updated graphics.
The only bad thing for me was in the challenge maps. While the settings where memorable, Arkham Knight has added so much to the combat that these older modes felt like less than what I have come used to. 
If you have never played an Arkham game, start here and have a blast. If you played them before, it is nothing at all new. However, they are great games that I enjoyed for round 3.
The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because Arkham Origins is not included."^4^February 3, 2017

It diminishes the brilliant performances from Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroe and the rest of the crew. Arkham City had terrible subtitles and was clearly rushed. They should send patches to fix these problems. Also in Arkham Asylum they should've taken the time to see that Batman was appropriately wet from the rain and everyone else was dry"^3^January 8, 2017

Brando, ^26517545^9^1^"After watching my friend playing I honestly wasn't thinking about getting this game, even though I've been a Final Fantasy since the beginning. Once I gave it a shot though I have not stopped having fun. It's an odd mix for the series but it works great as an RPG. The monsters are awesome! The combat system takes a little to get used to. I have not had this much fun with a Final Fantasy game in a long time."^5^December 5, 2016
Mike, ^26517545^8^2^"This game is just simply amazing the best final fantasy to be released in a long time. It has a nice feel to it that long time final fantasy players and new to the series can both enjoy. I highly recommend picking this one up."^5^December 7, 2016
Bryan, ^26517545^6^30^"If your into games with a rich story, fun  gameplay, good side mission, and character development. Then this isn't the game for you. This is a lame a 'final fantasy' game where four guys go camping and drive in a car. From the beginning to the end, you hardly know anything about the characters(ALL). There really isn't a story. And the so-called 'open world' is limited, where stupid tree bushes and boulders will keep u from exploring."^1^December 3, 2016
Disappointed, ^26517545^4^33^"Pros - Riding Chocobo, fighting gameplay, and graphics
Cons - Limited storyline, what you see initially is ALL you get for the map,  very repetitive missions, party members will get lost and won't assist in fights

1st off.. even though noctis is prince/king to be married.  he neither tend to his kingdom or get married. Instead he is out hunting daemons, camping, & driving with his bros. 
2nd... there suppose to be a big emphasis on brotherhood/friendship between the 4 but gladiolus is just there to constantly enforce the idea that noct need to man up throughout the ENTIRE game. While ignis just belittle noct and prompto even though he's suppose to be advisor to the king."^1^December 3, 2016

slouchycowman, ^37789145^85^9^"Grand Theft Auto V is a very good game that has tons of content within it. The area that you can explore within the game is larger than all the other previous Grand Theft Auto games combined. The game centers around three characters Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. The game allows you to eventually jump between the characters and do missions that are exclusively tied to that character's storyline.

The game is dense and looks beautiful. You will definitely get your money's worth with this game. You can probably put in over a 100 hours of gameplay if you want to. There is so much that you can do within the game, for example you can go to a movie theater within the game and watch a short movie about a british robot who curses. There are tons of missions that you can do and I feel if you liked the previous GTA games you will love this one.

Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have."^5^September 16, 2014

pfcstuck, ^24774751^6^2^"I own ever entry of this series and I love the direction they went with the gameplay. I have not finished the story mode, so I will limit my comments on the story, but so far it is inferior to the first games. The vastly improved naval battle mechanic brings so much to the world of Assassin's Creed that any new addition will feel almost naked without it. The map system is intuitive and easy to use and adds much to the open world gameplay. You perform specific missions that reveal items on the map which makes looking for items much less of a chore. The only problem I have is that many of the controlls are routed through the 'O' button and the game sometimes confuses what you want to do, especially when entering swordfights. The button is used for both blocking during fights and sheathing the sword when not in fights. I have been hit many times because I went to block and my character ended up sheathing his sword. I played the X-box version and I have the same issue there. The triggers are not used in swordfights and I feels that they should return to using them to parry like in the first few games. Both systems also have a glitch that causes you to go to fighting with yyour fists if you transition between swords and pistols."^5^February 18, 2014

Kaputnik, ^49696163^3^0^"This game has great 3rd person, action-RPG elements and a pretty fun loot system. The blend between genres is similar to that of the Borderlands series or Destiny. With a pretty solid amount of content and extras to explore, you can guarantee at least 40-60 hours of fun PvE action. However, if you are interested in the PvP combat--which is somewhat daunting due to high-leveled, gear junky, misfit campers--you can easily milk out another 100+ hours. This game was fun and held its interest for quite a while but it takes so many aspects from other games that I cannot help but feel slightly bored with the entirety of the game. It won't get that 5th star until it has demonstrated something that makes it truly unique from other iterations of this genre bending niche. The most unique aspect of the game, in my opinion, was the method of unlocking skills and passive abilities, which is by upgrading a command center with useful accommodations.

5 stars for fun loot/crafting system, an interesting story, some unique game mechanics, and adequate length of interest."^5^April 25, 2016

Eric, ^51933797^20^174^"This game would have been awesome....15 years ago. The underpowered weapons and lack of selection is horrible. The tanks are overpowered so everyone just runs around in tanks to capture locations. 

The graphics are great, but there is so much going on in the widely open maps that you can't see what the heck is going on half the time. IMO the futuristic jet packs and weapons with multiple add ons is far superior to this. I usually do not write reviews or overanalyze video games, but I was very excited for this and feel like I wasted $60. Very thankful I didn't spend $80 to get this boring game 3 days early. 

If you like the idea of shooting 100 year old firearms with awful sights while 60+ people are running around like a riot in the desert then this game may be for you."^2^October 21, 2016

The problem is, it's too good like you get so involved in the game 30 minutes flies by. If your debating on whether you should buy this game or not, I definitely recommend it. First off it's made by Dice, they put a lot of thought into all their games and Battle Field 1 is arguably their best one yet. Battlefield one has also blew its competition outa the water. Battlefield has 235,245 players currently playing on its servers. It's competition infinite warfare has only 15,076 players.

JCGA, ^51933797^2^4^"The gameplay is fun and exciting. The musical score really sounds epic at the right times. The variety of game modes is a bonus over previous battlefield games. Some of the weapons need to be better balanced, and tanks feel a little over powered compared to the tools needed to destroy them.  The game is lacking in customization, and the supply crates are a stupid cash grab. The biggest issue is the menu system. It's slow and clunky and it freezes up a good bit when leaving games. Your seriously better off closing the whole game app and restarting than waiting for it to leave the server and go back to the main menu, but asside from that it is a good buy."^4^December 19, 2016

I haven't even played the Modern Warfare Remastered yet because I'm still enjoying the Infinite Warfare but I'll have that to look forward to when I beat the first game.

techtjw, ^40572239^17^3^"I enjoyed Advanced Warfare for what it is worth. The controls are classic and easy to use. The graphics are top notch on my PS4. The story - well that is my only issue with this game.

I'm a original Call of Duty gamer and have played through them all. I have steadily watched as Call of Duty games have ventured further from what 'could' happen as of today's technology in true warfare. I enjoyed the Call of Duty games that were reenactments of previous wars. This game is nothing close to what could be possible. It takes your imagination to actually put you in this field of battle. A hefty dose of imagination.

All that said, my imagination works fine and even against my own idea of never buying this game to protest the changes from reality to fantasy, I did buy it and it so happens I enjoy it. I would recommend this game to anyone that is a lover of first person shooters. The price point as of this writing is fantastic and if you have a next generation console - do invest in this ambitious installment of the beloved Call of Duty franchise."^4^March 3, 2015

Even though we all play the games for escapist reasons, a lot of us prefer that they be more realistic and not so futuristic. On a positive note, buying this from the Walmart online store, I was able to save about $20 on the purchase. I also enjoy the online multiplayer aspect of the game that allows me to play with friends and family that live in other parts of the country."^3^May 23, 2015

Boogie, ^55115865^10^1^"For everyone complaining about the facial animations, there is only a couple scenes that look 'odd', but funny nonetheless. Yes there are some repetitive side quests, however being in an entire NEW galaxy wouldn't you want to traverse across the giant planets? Some hilarious dialogue, not as witty as the previous ME games. The only CON is that they have taken away the renegade/paragon options, however you can still choose to do some messed up stuff that will have consequences later on. Multiplayer is intense, and extremely fun/addicting (4 player co-op) that ties into the single player campaign."^4^April 2, 2017

DarthMike, ^35853378^11^2^"I originally purchased this on launch day and kind of hated it. I wasn't playing it right and beat it as quick as I could without doing the optional objectives or missions. I really wasted the value of the game and sold it after a month. I had some remorse after that and bought it again after 3 months for very cheap. I ended up playing it correctly and really came to appreciate what they did with this game. After the dreadful launch Ubi also gave away all the DLC for free which was a huge plus. I then went on to earn 100% sync on the game and got every trophy on PS4 to platinum the game. After I sold it and now 1 year later I have repurchased the game for only $15 because I really enjoyed it a lot before and wanted to play through the story again after I finish AC Syndicate. I definitely recommend this game as well as Syndicate. They are really fantastic games."^5^January 1, 2016

There is so much to do in this game, one of the best parts is that you can customize your towns!

It challenges your mind and character through the game. I don't play xbox games, but I sure love watching the kids and my husband play this game. I've even help them at times.

The game play is amazing, and and the campaign will surely interest you.

The only flaw I seen while playing and you see it on the cover. Batman looks way to muscular. I am sure that Bruce Wayne has more important thing to attend to then the gym."^5^November 10, 2011

Michelle, ^49972470^3^0^"AC Syndicate has so many improvements over Unity that it can be forgiven for its weak storyline. It is more of a GTA meets Batman set in the 1800's. The hard work that went into making it one of the most beautiful AC games is truly appreciated. This game is easily the 3rd best in the series after AC2 and Black Flag.

So what did they do right.
 Multiple ways to engage a mission, i.e. stealth or brute force. And this time the stealth version works! (sorry Unity)
 Play as either male or female character outside the main missions. For some reason, I found Evie easier to control.
 Return of the hidden blade. Now players can sneak up behind baddies and stab them in the back!
 Grappling hook. Taking a play from the batman series it makes traveling around London fast and fun. Easily transitioning from rooftop to rooftop, and nothing like dropping a smoke bomb and escaping a group of enemies.
 Different activities. This is really an open world game. There are so many activities to do including: Fight Club, carriage racing, cargo stealing, cargo escorting, and intercepting thieves.
 Horse carriages to drive around.
 Outstanding graphics and visuals. The amount of detail put into this game just amazes me. The splash of a puddle while running down the street, listening to a barber shop quartet, a gazebo band play, workers push around barrels as they toil the day away, kids playing ball, cats wondering the allies, day night cycles, weather cycles. Gone are the days of AC1's NPC rubbing his shoulder and grumbling.
 No more companion app!
 Better mission checkpoints in case you fail during a mission. No more restarting from the beginning.

Things to improve:
 Better controls when hijacking a carriage. Many times I had to hijack a carriage only to jump off the carriage instead. Bad design using the same button form hijack and jump off.
 Better integration of the Animus and Templar storyline. Aside from a brief cinematic at the beginning and end, the game had no relation to any of the AC games.
 The main story line was very disjointed, switching between the two heroes made me stop caring after about the 4th mission.
 Better fast travel to the hideout. Hunting all over the map for the train icon is frustrating. There should have been a better way to get the hideout on the main map.
 Better way to exit the train. Seriously, trying to get off the train hideout is near impossible aside from going to the back and jumping off.
 Combat could use some improvement. It felt a button mash fest, as countering an enemy's advance never seemed to be timed right.

Overall, this is a great game if you like open world activity games. It is more of an evolution than a revolution from prior games in the series. I definitely received my moneys worth out of the game."^5^February 6, 2017
Cjjd, ^49972455^0^1^"It's a nice port, but you can tell they didn't pay as much attention to some characters when it comes to the animation, otherwise it's a priceless gem that looks a bit better on a cooler looking console."^4^June 3, 2016

It's so much fun I love how they added headquarters and how all those people in there is from your area so you are able to make a lot of new friends that's actually where your from. Their was a lot of glitches at first which is to be expected with any new game especially such a big game as call of duty but all those have been fixed since. If you have been waiting for a call of duty to come out that's more like cod 4 and world at war then you defiantly need to try this one out cause you won't be disappointed!"^5^December 23, 2017

Kory, ^43172614^8^1^"If you have never played Borderlands, you really are missing out on a lot of fun, although not if you are going to play solo. In this remastered edition of Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel you can really see the difference in comparison to the PS3 versions, the graphics look more defined and loading speed faster. My only gripe was that the game did not come with the slip case you see included in the stores (ordered online), and I would have REALLY loved to have it."^5^December 7, 2015

Cassandra, ^43172614^5^0^"I absolutely love the Borderlands games, they're so much fun! With a couple of different characters to choose from, you'll find something to fit your preferred fighting style. My personal favorite is the soldier with his turrets. My husband and I play this together all the time when we're bored. We've both beaten them multiple times, oddly enough it's one of the few games I never tire off. FYI, this is not a game for kids. Loads of cursing and violence, it's a great way to let off some steam!

The graphics are in this great comic book style which I didn't think would appeal to me, but it's actually pretty great. The first Borderlands is still my favorite, but these other two are worth checking out!"^5^March 31, 2017

PHOENIXGAMERPS4PRO, ^52664456^10^0^"I have played all resident evil games, and for me the best horror one is Resident Evil 2, I thought there were never going to ever create a similar game to R2 again since shinji mikami is not part of the team anymore since resident evil 4, he did realease a game called THE EVIL WITHIN pretty decent. , but this game R7! goes back to the classic horror music and scaring you all of the sudden when you don't expected. I also like the fact that the dead bodies dont just disappear, they actually remain in the floor , this makes it more real like r2. I really believe this game is one of the more scariest games  I ever played. I used VR headset and it is so scary having monsters right in front of your face in 3D.  I am glad they still know that this type of game is what people want, not the boring action  stuff from resident evil 5 and  6. I rate this game 5 STARS."^5^June 16, 2017

Hyati, ^41048687^1^0^"This game wouldn't get any stars if I could help it. The rating isn't cuz of Walmart (it was great in terms of ordering online and in store pick up) or even the content itself either. It couldn't be for the content. The game never worked from the minute our kids tried playing it. Not to mention it prompted my hubby to pay $25 to get it properly working through Ps4 and EA links, which he paid since this was a Christmas gift for our kids, and it still didn't work. When he contacted EA via phone he waited for 2hrs before someone answered and they literally left him hanging on the line while the operator didn't talk and you could hear people laughing in the background. He said he waited for about 10mins with questions of 'hello? Anyone there? I need help please. Can anyone help? I can hear you...can someone please answer?' He finally hung up and then received an email 5mins later stating '...we tried calling you at the number you provided but there was no answer...' What?! Really?! We called you! He even sent an email to their customer service line with the complaint and a screen shot to show the duration of time he was on the phone with them but no response. So frustrating. Thankfully we got our money back from Walmart. Unfortunately, we don't know how to get the $25 back we basically wasted trying to get it to work. Buyer beware. Don't waste your money trying to get it to work via the network. If you can't play it as soon as you put it on your game system just return it to where you bought it. It's not worth the Hassel we went through."^1^January 5, 2017
RocktheGame, ^45986210^1^2^"The main game is excellent. You don't get to do much in terms of gameplay, it's more like the book series Choose Your Own Adventure in video game format. In this case, that isn't a bad thing. Telltale has perfected cutscene-driven games. The writing is great and the characters are interesting. You do feel immersed in the game world and care about the direction of the story. However, the DLC 400 Days leaves a lot to be desired. It's worth the money if you get it bundled with the game, but don't buy it separately. You barely get to explore the characters' stories and it leaves you wanting more, but not in a good way."^5^March 22, 2016

As for the game the striking controls are pretty close to the same but the ground game is completely different.  I've only played it once since it came.  I think I'll get used to it.  The first game  had a bug where if someone took our back you kept going from being mounted to back control and repeat and you couldn't get out.  Hopefully there aren't any bugs like that."^4^November 22, 2016

slouchycowman, ^32427700^12^3^"Injustice: Gods Among Us is a great fighting game that you will love. I am almost finished with the story mode of the game and the story is very good. This version has some additional content and it only makes the game even stronger.

These player vs. player fighting games usually do not have a good story but this one has a pretty compelling story. The story within the game is similar to some of the storylines within the comics. The graphics within the game are great and most importantly the fighting mechanics are solid as well. If you like fighting game you will love this one. I would definitely recommend this game.

jonpauljones1995, ^25710674^9^0^"This truly is a great game
Story: if you chose the heroes route it shows a a path of someone whos willing to put his life on the line to protect his people and the evil route is a hero go's too far story so it over all your choice
Graphics: they're great and the game tuns at a solid 60 FPS (Frames Per Second)
Powers' you have 4 sets of powers to play with, smoke with is a short range combat power with some power house attacks and a finisher move that's meme worthy, neon you have long range plasma powers with is good for picking off from a dis tence and are given to you from a vigilante named Abigail or 'feth'as she prefers then my personal favorite is video where you can turn invisible fire repulser beams fly hover and shoot exploding sword missiles and finally concrete witch is post game only 
the good: well there's a lot to do to free a locked down Seattle but it's not with out it's kinks
the bad: it gets repetitive fast and 2 endings can be a double edge blade and not much use for the concrete is disappointing i say it's a 4/5 not perfect but well worth the miney"^4^June 6, 2016

Was surprised when I received an email that it was in-store and ready for pickup one day early. Printed the email just like it said and went to the service counter. Pressed the touch pad as the instructions states and waited for 20 minutes. After 5 different employees walked by me in and out of the back room, I asked the employee that was cleaning the bathroom if anyone was going to show up. He looked for someone and when the employee arrived he looked at my ID and went in the back of the store to fetch my game. After another 20 minutes he comes back and says it isn't in the store.

BygoneSamurai, ^37003724^2^0^"Battelfield 4 on the Xbox One is amazing. If you liked this game on the Xbox 360 and plan on getting an Xbox One, the upgrade is well worth it. You can expand your gameplay from the usual 12V12 to 32V32 in multiplayer or you can just stick with the 12V12. The maps are expanded and you have more room to roam and find better hiding spots for you Snipers. There is more detailed environments, more vehicles per map, and team play is expanded greatly. If you were tired of all the glitches and freezes that use to happen, the new Fall update fixes all of them and improves a lot of things in the game. I purchased this game and my premium was upgraded from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One for free. I can't guarantee this will happen for everyone though as there may be a time limit on it."^5^October 28, 2014

Shar, ^24928932^3^1^"In this game you are a master hacker who had one of your jobs go bad. Your family manages to get dragged into your mess and you're on a mission throughout the game to correct the wrongs/save yourself and your family.

The storyline seems simple enough at first but then gets a little wacky. I don't want to spoil the plot but let's just say there were a few too many curveballs. For people who don't play every day, it can be easy to forget the storyline or characters that were introduced the last time that you played.  

You basically have to use 3 things to beat this game: driving, shooting, and hacking.

Driving: IMO, the driving in this game is really frustrating. I don't game much so I can't compare it to other games, but the fast cars have almost zero steering handling. Nearly impossible to control (atleast for me) when I'm chasing or running from enemies. 

Shooting: You have a large selection of firearms to choose from plus some explosives. I had to engage in far more combat missions than I anticipated for this game but I loved them! I played the game on 'Normal' mode and still found the battles to be very challenging. You can't simply aim, shoot, and kill the enemy. Guns recoil, targets move, shoot back, call for backup, etc. In many missions you come under HEAVY fire. Enemies don't go down easy,  The shootouts are the best part of this game.

Hacking: This was the reason that I bought the game. The hacking may be the easiest part of the entire game. I wish the game provided more of a challenge in the hacking/puzzle solving part of the game but I understand they have to appeal to a broad audience who are probably not computer geeks like myself. 

I didn't even explore the online world, but I do know that I was hacked by online players a few times in the game. I disabled that feature. There are a lot of side missions that you can play too. So you're not just stuck to the storyline.

I give it 4 out of 5 stars because it managed to keep my attention and I have a very short attention span. It has a little bit of everything in it. Something for the people who like cars. Something for the people that like really in-depth story lines. Something for the people who like mystery or solving puzzles. It covers alot. A very good buy, especially for the price."^4^May 28, 2016

slouchycowman, ^32427700^12^3^"Injustice: Gods Among Us is a great fighting game that you will love. I am almost finished with the story mode of the game and the story is very good. This version has some additional content and it only makes the game even stronger.

These player vs. player fighting games usually do not have a good story but this one has a pretty compelling story. The story within the game is similar to some of the storylines within the comics. The graphics within the game are great and most importantly the fighting mechanics are solid as well. If you like fighting game you will love this one. I would definitely recommend this game.

jonpauljones1995, ^25710674^9^0^"This truly is a great game
Story: if you chose the heroes route it shows a a path of someone whos willing to put his life on the line to protect his people and the evil route is a hero go's too far story so it over all your choice
Graphics: they're great and the game tuns at a solid 60 FPS (Frames Per Second)
Powers' you have 4 sets of powers to play with, smoke with is a short range combat power with some power house attacks and a finisher move that's meme worthy, neon you have long range plasma powers with is good for picking off from a dis tence and are given to you from a vigilante named Abigail or 'feth'as she prefers then my personal favorite is video where you can turn invisible fire repulser beams fly hover and shoot exploding sword missiles and finally concrete witch is post game only 
the good: well there's a lot to do to free a locked down Seattle but it's not with out it's kinks
the bad: it gets repetitive fast and 2 endings can be a double edge blade and not much use for the concrete is disappointing i say it's a 4/5 not perfect but well worth the miney"^4^June 6, 2016

TheV1c1ousOne, ^25710672^18^38^"Graphically the game is great and the story is so-so. However the multiplayer is absolute garbage! I really do not understand why fanboys of this game act like the multiplayer is the best ever because it is FAR from that. The fixed spawning just begs for spawn campers to sit just at the right distance and pick you off as soon as you spawn. Another thing that annoyed me was that you could walk around a corner without knowing and step into the enemy base camp and you are instantly killed by one of the turrets.

You can forget about running around the map and hitting the enemy hard as this game essentially encourages camping. 4 out of 8 games I played tonight the enemy team sat at their base camp protected by the default turrets the entire match. Needless to say it was boring and eventually I said enough was enough and quit this garbage game and will never play it again.

Great single player and great graphics but the multiplayer is just an absolute nightmare. And already trolls are about with their finger on the 'share' button to show off how stupid they are already on twitch which is intergrated into the PS4. Do yourself a favor and rent this first because if you are expecting this to be as good or better than Call of Duty Ghosts you will be sadly disappointed."^2^November 17, 2013

It didn't disappoint. It really explored the new technology of the PS4 and had a pretty good story to. If I had to find something negative to say about it, I would say I didn't like that every single button on the controller had a purpose (some buttons more the one purpose).

Liannableu, ^33006932^16^1^"Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most intricate and unique games I've ever played. However, I may be a bit biased because I absolutely love everything Witcher. I have read every English translated Witcher book there is, as well as played all of the games. The first thing you will probably notice about CD Projekt Red's latest masterpiece is its astonishing and mind-blowing graphics. I will confess that the previously mentioned graphics are a bit of a downgrade from the teaser we saw in 2013, but it's not enough to make it unworthy of buying.
The world of the Witcher 3 is by far the most stunning thing I've ever witnessed in a game. The complaint I read the most is that the combat is really hard and not very well put together, when playing on console. Having played previous Witcher games the control scheme wasn't much of a stretch from what I was used to, but I see where other people are coming from. The problem with gamers today, is that we've almost no patience. If you actually read the tutorials and take your time you'll get used to the game in no time flat. I hate to be blunt, but Witcher 3 is not a game for the weak or ignorant player. It takes time, charisma, and a bit of finesse, but is well worth it.
In my opinion the most important aspect of a good RPG is the story. When I play the Witcher main quests, side quests, and sometimes even contracts, it is one of the most immersive and fun games I have played in a long time. Before Dragon Age: Inquisition released I was so excited for to play it. However, after you annihilate the campaign a few times it can be really boring. Witcher 3 is not like that. The campaign takes way longer than that of most role playing games, yet manages to keep you excited, intrigued, and surprised. The last thing I should mention is the open-world of this game. The size of Skyrim? Maybe not, but this Multi-Region world is so huge there is a good chance you'll never see all of it. The fact that the Witcher's open-world is close to the size of Skyrim's and doesn't have an abundance of in traversable mountains, is why I'd say Witcher 3 has a better world."^5^June 7, 2015
Tasha, ^33006932^8^1^"Map: very vast, tons of things to do and explore.
Glitches: very few, especially for such a large game.
Autosaves: well-placed, so that when the few glitches in gameplay happen and you're forced to quit no matter your last save, you don't lose any progress.
Quests: tons of quests, and the feature which tells you what level you ought to be before attempting a quest is accurate.

Only 'complaint': this game is way, way too much fun. I can't get anything done. I'm addicted.

Also, even though it's Witcher 3, even if you haven't played the previous ones - like me - you aren't lost in the story.

Oh, and just FYI... they say to run the other way when an enemy has a red skull by its title. Follow that advice. Especially if there's more than one."^5^July 1, 2015

Was surprised when I received an email that it was in-store and ready for pickup one day early. Printed the email just like it said and went to the service counter. Pressed the touch pad as the instructions states and waited for 20 minutes. After 5 different employees walked by me in and out of the back room, I asked the employee that was cleaning the bathroom if anyone was going to show up. He looked for someone and when the employee arrived he looked at my ID and went in the back of the store to fetch my game. After another 20 minutes he comes back and says it isn't in the store.

BygoneSamurai, ^37003724^2^0^"Battelfield 4 on the Xbox One is amazing. If you liked this game on the Xbox 360 and plan on getting an Xbox One, the upgrade is well worth it. You can expand your gameplay from the usual 12V12 to 32V32 in multiplayer or you can just stick with the 12V12. The maps are expanded and you have more room to roam and find better hiding spots for you Snipers. There is more detailed environments, more vehicles per map, and team play is expanded greatly. If you were tired of all the glitches and freezes that use to happen, the new Fall update fixes all of them and improves a lot of things in the game.

Shar, ^24928932^3^1^"In this game you are a master hacker who had one of your jobs go bad. Your family manages to get dragged into your mess and you're on a mission throughout the game to correct the wrongs/save yourself and your family.

The storyline seems simple enough at first but then gets a little wacky. I don't want to spoil the plot but let's just say there were a few too many curveballs. For people who don't play every day, it can be easy to forget the storyline or characters that were introduced the last time that you played.  

You basically have to use 3 things to beat this game: driving, shooting, and hacking.

Driving: IMO, the driving in this game is really frustrating. I don't game much so I can't compare it to other games, but the fast cars have almost zero steering handling. Nearly impossible to control (atleast for me) when I'm chasing or running from enemies. 

Shooting: You have a large selection of firearms to choose from plus some explosives. I had to engage in far more combat missions than I anticipated for this game but I loved them! I played the game on 'Normal' mode and still found the battles to be very challenging. You can't simply aim, shoot, and kill the enemy. Guns recoil, targets move, shoot back, call for backup, etc. In many missions you come under HEAVY fire. Enemies don't go down easy,  The shootouts are the best part of this game.

Hacking: This was the reason that I bought the game. The hacking may be the easiest part of the entire game. I wish the game provided more of a challenge in the hacking/puzzle solving part of the game but I understand they have to appeal to a broad audience who are probably not computer geeks like myself. 

I didn't even explore the online world, but I do know that I was hacked by online players a few times in the game. I disabled that feature. There are a lot of side missions that you can play too. So you're not just stuck to the storyline.

I give it 4 out of 5 stars because it managed to keep my attention and I have a very short attention span. It has a little bit of everything in it. Something for the people who like cars. Something for the people that like really in-depth story lines. Something for the people who like mystery or solving puzzles. It covers alot. A very good buy, especially for the price."^4^May 28, 2016

^55488469^8^0^"This is the cheapest I've found a pre-owned copy of the game.  You don't get the Masamune sword unless the person before you didn't redeem it but that's the way with all used games that have bonus dlc. I've heard the sword isn't all that great anyway.

I've never gotten a used game from Wal-Mart before.  The game cd is in excellent shape.  There were no scratches, no smudges. The game works perfectly so far. I've only had it less than a day. The case came wrapped in plastic. There is a sticker letting you know it is pre-owned. Is it that way for all pre-owned games from here? Doubtful as that is the nature of used cds. I will say that this came in better shape than all of the used games I've gotten from GameStop although that could be coincidental.

As for the game, I've been enjoying it a lot even though I haven't been able to play it that much yet.  The music is wonderful as one would expect. I've only played V and VI, and that was back in the day. It's amazing how far the franchise has come.  The game is beautiful. I can't wait to get a chocobo."^5^June 28, 2017
Chaisiri, ^55488469^4^0^"The condition of the game made my sister and I wonder if it was actually 'preown'. The game was in PERFECT condition. Although , it did not come with a code for the Masamune. However, the sword itself isn't all that good and if you really want the sword. As of right now, you can get it for .49 cents at the playstation store. Of course, I came home, and tried the game immediately. I wasn't surprise that It was working perfectly because there was no scratch on the disc at all. Great preown value.

WoWGmr, ^26096325^5^41^"I love Elder Scrolls. I do not care for Elder Scrolls Online. Bethesda has joined the bandwagon. They have sold out to the cesspool of F2P game producers.

While the gimmick has been 'No subscription fee ever is you purchase the game', this is a guise. You did not get a special deal. You payed for the game. Many games are Free2Play and they are Free2Download without the need to pay anyone, ever. Star Wars: The Old Republic is one of these games. you can download the entire game for free and play for free. Yes, a subscription opens locked features. Yes, purchasing individual feature unlocks are available. My point is you will never have to pay to play SWTOR. Free download of the game. Free play time.

I am posting this review after seeing a few of the other reviews.
1. Yes you need PlayStation plus to play. Like basically all online games you need to buy ps4 or xbox1s online service. This game can only be played online.
2. Besides ps+ you do not need anything else. You can purchase a $10 upgrade to deluxe version. You can pay for more coins if you do not want to spend time earning them. Like gw1 all updates (dlc) are free for this game. The people buying coins allows for free dlc for all."^5^May 17, 2016
DisappointedDad, ^36708965^6^2^"I figured this would be a good gift for my 10 year old son and was very disappointed when he tried to play it and could not get past the menu screen.  This game requires online play and play station plus, which is not free.  Even after signing up for a free trial we could not get the game to connect to the EA site.  What happened to the good old Nintendo days where you got a game, put it in the console, and played."^1^February 12, 2017
YoungMomofOne, ^36708965^4^0^"My 7 year old son and my husband both really enjoy this game but there is a huge drawback, you have to have ps plus to use it. You can't play it without it. So right there is a $50+ membership yearly cost to play a game you've purchased. Then on top of that you have to have wifi AND it uses EA servers to connect. So when my grandma bought this for my son for Christmas I opened it early to get it downloaded on the PlayStation and when I tried to test the game the servers were down which renders the game entirely useless. It's insane to me they'd make a game that you can't play without three major stipulations. Were it not purchased for him I had no intention of buying it for this very reason. Very cool game though if you can meet all the requirements."^3^December 29, 2016

BTruds, ^55781563^0^1^"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. After looking for the best deal at various stores, Walmart's pricing was 25.00 less than their competitors. 
As for the game itself, it's not perfect but one of the better Maddens in recent years. Madden 18 may not be perfect in all areas of the game, but it's a solid game that keeps improving. Commentary, presentation and graphics are better than ever before. EA's Frostbite engine may not have been implemented as well as it could have been, but for a first year effort, it's a solid foundation that should improve. The PS4 Pro enhancements truly change this game for the better. Having a solid 60 frames per second on 1080P resolution and amazingly clear HDR graphics on 4K televisions truly makes a ton of difference over 17 and previous years. Franchise hasn't seen a lot of improvements come its way, but its minor fixes to commentary and menu quirks perfect what was already there. Here's hoping for an overhaul in 19. Longshot is a surprisingly fun story mode that ends far too soon. I honestly hope an NFL-based sequel that uses your save data from Madden 18 will be added next year, instead of a completely new story with new characters. All things considered, this is a solid game that, in spite of its imperfections, does a lot to emulate what fans see on Sundays. It could be better. But what's there is certainly admirable, and hopefully it continues to improve next season under Frostbite."^5^December 26, 2017

Disappointed, ^45589070^140^42^"There is no campaign on the 360 version and cannot play multiplayer unless online. Very disappointed.

TheKnowledgableOne, ^45589070^131^47^"Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 will most likely be the last game released for the XBox 360 which is why you should at least be happy that it's a solid multiplayer game with a side of Zombies to boot.
The multiplayer Beta included a wealth of multiplayer content to unlock once you reach a certain level. Since there's no Campaign, multiplayer has a lot to hold up on its own (and mostly succeeds) although it could use some fine tuning. Some specialist abilities are OP (over-powered) while others barely do anything in combat. Certain weapons (Razorback & M8A7) dominate the battlefield and if you use a more unpopular gun, you'll get slaughtered by those two aforementioned guns. When Treyarch (the developer) releases more patches to fix things in the multiplayer, it should be astronomically better.
Zombies, sadly, isn't at its best this year. With a mediocre base game map (Shadows of Evil), there isn't much to say about Treyarch's fan favorite mode.
Overall, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is a solid game that simply needs some fine tuning before the base game is launched November 6th."^3^October 17, 2015
Highlymad, ^45589070^103^29^"There's no campaign you can't play 2 players on multiplayer or zombies unless you have Xbox live. Playing the zombies by yourself you can't even get passed level 5. If I would have known this I would not have wasted 50.00 bucks."^1^November 11, 2015
xab3rcrmb3x, ^45589070^45^25^"I am a big COD fan I always pre-order their new games but COD Black Ops III has been the biggest disappointment for many reasons.
First of all I really don't like how this version does not have the campaign. I am paying a lot of money for the game and it should have the same things all the other systems have.
The lag on this game is awful I get kicked out of games all the time and my game freezes constantly.
The most annoying part is how long it takes to get into a game on zombies it takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours .
There are also issues with the gun customization i will set up my guns but they are not that way when I get them on the map and sometimes my game even FREEZES or I get connection interrupted and kicked from the game if I pick up a gun.
Multiplayer is the same you almost never get to play a full game you either lag out or your game freezes it is very irritating.
For all these reasons I would have to say that I would not recommend this game it is just a waste of money!"^1^December 12, 2015
mommysdayout, ^45589070^42^17^"We bought this for our son for Christmas. Looking at the game at the store, it had that it came with a full game digital download! Not being able to actually read the fine print because he was in the store with us... just being diverted while my husband bought it... we bought it because it was something he was dying for for Christmas. Keep in mind we do not have the means to spoil our children and this was his only big present for Christmas. We let him open it a few days early because he is going to Grandma's after Christmas so we wanted him to be able to play it before he left. This game was a huge disappointment to say the least! It is not the full game, he can't play multiplayer unless it is with strangers on xbox live and the nice free digital download that we thought was Black Ops 3 was the original Black Ops that he already has. It is a $30.00 paper weight that we can't take back because it was opened. IT DOES NOT HAVE CO-OP OR SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN GAME MODE, AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL GAME FEATURES PRESENT IN THE XBOX ONE VERSION. <The small fine print on the back!!!!

Baloo, ^45589070^31^17^"It's clear on the black ops 3 cover the limitations of game play for 360 so it's contents should come at little surprise. That being said, if your going to provide multiplayer and zombies single player/ online only, activision could have at least have had the online aspect work flawlessly. This is not the case. Zombies single player looks inviting to say the least, but stalls consistently causing restart and actually participating in an on line zombies is difficult.

Multiplayer seems to work better but times out and freezes while trying to get to enter a match. Clearly black ops 3 for the Xbox 360 was an after thought and currently does not meet a recommendation."^2^November 15, 2015

This version is awful, it doesn't support split screen, so we can't even play together, and it has no campaign mode. I also don't know if it's just because we have the 360 version but the graphics are awful compared to black ops 2.

I highly doubt you're going to get ANY DLC content.

$39 now huh? i wouldn't pay $10 for it in fact i would like a refund. But the problem doesn't really start here PS4,XB1,PC, all have problems.

DO NOT BUY FOR XBOX360! unless u want to be dissapointed by game crashing and constantly losing connection to host, even when your connection is PEFECT. Tweating and emailing treyarch and activision is pointless as they never get back to you."^1^December 9, 2015

The deciding factor for me was that I knew that battlefield had a 50 dollars season pass and if I didn't buy it eventually I would be behind the DLC wall. Coming from destiny I know too well about having to pay for DLC . Titanfall will release new levels and new content at no charge,  if you like one of the  cosmetic skins for titans just buy it at the store.  I have yet to spend extra money in game, there's so much to unlock.  The game is excellent,  amazing storyline that I'm sure I'll play over again to find the secrets and Easter eggs.  I like that it has a twist in it, it's not a generic story of kill all the bad guys.  Online play is solid,  never played the first one  so I'm a total newbie at it but I don't care if I get taken out because I have so much fun. I love to go up against other titans, inside my own or on the ground.  There's no experience like it in any other shooter,  I hope the 3rd titanfall has VR support that would be epic.  If you're on the fence about this game just kick it down and buy it.  You'll enjoy it alot more than what's out there because it's different."^5^December 11, 2016

casualgamer, ^52599732^3^1^"Incredibly good game. This game really didn't have much hype surrounding it before launch. But after reading and watching all of the positive reviews on the game I had to try it. After a few hours of gameplay it is easy to see why many are calling this the best first person shooter of the year."^5^December 7, 2016
DBizzle, ^52599732^3^15^"The campaign was absolutely INCREDIBLE! Although it was terribly short, I had a lot of fun playing through the campaign!  The game runs incredibly smooth and looks good! That being said, the multiplayer is exactly like the new terrible futuristic COD games! It takes FOREVER to unlock any weapon worth using, the game starts you off with all the terrible weapons that no one uses! So you are constantly getting killed over and over again by higher leveled people that have already unlocked all the good weapons! It is not fun at all! I never played the first Titanfall but everyone says this one is a lot better then the first! 

So I guess if you like the new fake wall running, overly fast paced COD games where it takes 2 bullets to die and 13 bullets to kill then you might enjoy this game but I wont be wasting anymore time in the multiplayer! That being said, I would def recommend the game for the story, but not so much for the PvP! The campaign only took me MAYBE 5 hours to complete! Wish it would have been a lot longer because it truly was amazing! Sorry RESPAWN but you only get 2 stars from me due to making a game WAY to similar to the new age COD that everyone hates on!"^2^November 30, 2016

snowminican, ^52599732^1^0^"I recently purchased this because i wanted a change of pace with the shooter's iv'e been playing. I was hesitant because, while the first one was well made, it had many shortcomings. I can gladly say a lot of the issues found with the first one are resolved here. For starters the campaign is one of the better shooter campaign's i have played. For reference I have played destiny, Call of Duty, Battlefield and Killzone recently. The campaign is average shooter length with a lot of fun things to do that i wont spoil here. 
    The multiplayer built on the first game with 8 titans available as oppose to 3. You have a lot of customization options and i like that unlockables are based on you using the weapon or titan. Overall I found this game well worth the purchase price and recommended it to a number of friends."^5^December 9, 2016

APicky90sGamer, ^52599732^0^12^"As much as I enjoyed the first Titain Fall game this year was no more then unessisary. From a over hyped game such as BF1 and COD IW it was just underwhelming. Titanfall 2 had one of many great campaign modes and a memorable storyline. As for the gameplay it was fair not great but equally to current futurisic FPS. For me it fell short of even 2 stars I'm just optimistic. This game is great if you just started playing video games but over the years its simply lacking in content and replay value it fun in the moment but also forgettable in the same light.  If you do plan of purchasing this game I urge my fellow gamers who look for specific things you like in your gaming experiences and to play the demo first or rent this game first before hand. As long as you know what you like and exspect in a game from story to gameplay you should be fine. As for sheeple aimlessly buying this game for the sake of buying a game best if luck to you. For this time around I rate a 2 Star. I simply expected more from a rightfully underrated game that is no more then a COD title of 2016."^2^December 24, 2016
Elate6, ^52599732^0^1^"At first this game seemed like the huge robots were too much, but after playing it, it proved my assumption wrong. You can only use the robots after so many kills are acquired which makes the game seems a lot better. It is similar to call of duty when it comes to the overall feel of the game. I was surprised to find out that was nothing like COD Advanced Warefare or even Infinite Warefare. This is a completely diferente game with a similar feel but 10x better IMO."^5^December 12, 2016

Pilot111, ^52599732^11^4^"I bought this during black Friday and had to choose between titanfall 2 and battlefield 1, I could have bought both but I only have time for one game. The deciding factor for me was that I knew that battlefield had a 50 dollars season pass and if I didn't buy it eventually I would be behind the DLC wall. Coming from destiny I know too well about having to pay for DLC . Titanfall will release new levels and new content at no charge,  if you like one of the  cosmetic skins for titans just buy it at the store.  I have yet to spend extra money in game, there's so much to unlock.  The game is excellent,  amazing storyline that I'm sure I'll play over again to find the secrets and Easter eggs.  I like that it has a twist in it, it's not a generic story of kill all the bad guys.  Online play is solid,  never played the first one  so I'm a total newbie at it but I don't care if I get taken out because I have so much fun. I love to go up against other titans, inside my own or on the ground.  There's no experience like it in any other shooter,  I hope the 3rd titanfall has VR support that would be epic.  If you're on the fence about this game just kick it down and buy it.  You'll enjoy it alot more than what's out there because it's different."^5^December 11, 2016
Rafl, ^52599732^9^4^"Its such a fun action packed game. Great story mode and plenty of online modes to keep you occupied for hours and hours. You get plenty of different perks that could let you fly around using a grappling hook or even run through an alternate dimension (the upside down) to escape an enemy or a giant titan from squishing you. All other FPS will be lacking after you start blowing things up with your titan."^5^November 14, 2016

TheV1c1ousOne, ^25710672^18^38^"Graphically the game is great and the story is so-so. However the multiplayer is absolute garbage! I really do not understand why fanboys of this game act like the multiplayer is the best ever because it is FAR from that. The fixed spawning just begs for spawn campers to sit just at the right distance and pick you off as soon as you spawn. Another thing that annoyed me was that you could walk around a corner without knowing and step into the enemy base camp and you are instantly killed by one of the turrets.

You can forget about running around the map and hitting the enemy hard as this game essentially encourages camping. 4 out of 8 games I played tonight the enemy team sat at their base camp protected by the default turrets the entire match. Needless to say it was boring and eventually I said enough was enough and quit this garbage game and will never play it again.

Great single player and great graphics but the multiplayer is just an absolute nightmare. And already trolls are about with their finger on the 'share' button to show off how stupid they are already on twitch which is intergrated into the PS4. Do yourself a favor and rent this first because if you are expecting this to be as good or better than Call of Duty Ghosts you will be sadly disappointed."^2^November 17, 2013

It didn't disappoint. It really explored the new technology of the PS4 and had a pretty good story to. If I had to find something negative to say about it, I would say I didn't like that every single button on the controller had a purpose (some buttons more the one purpose).

Liannableu, ^33006932^16^1^"Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most intricate and unique games I've ever played. However, I may be a bit biased because I absolutely love everything Witcher. I have read every English translated Witcher book there is, as well as played all of the games. The first thing you will probably notice about CD Projekt Red's latest masterpiece is its astonishing and mind-blowing graphics. I will confess that the previously mentioned graphics are a bit of a downgrade from the teaser we saw in 2013, but it's not enough to make it unworthy of buying.
The world of the Witcher 3 is by far the most stunning thing I've ever witnessed in a game. The complaint I read the most is that the combat is really hard and not very well put together, when playing on console. Having played previous Witcher games the control scheme wasn't much of a stretch from what I was used to, but I see where other people are coming from. The problem with gamers today, is that we've almost no patience. If you actually read the tutorials and take your time you'll get used to the game in no time flat. I hate to be blunt, but Witcher 3 is not a game for the weak or ignorant player. It takes time, charisma, and a bit of finesse, but is well worth it.
In my opinion the most important aspect of a good RPG is the story. When I play the Witcher main quests, side quests, and sometimes even contracts, it is one of the most immersive and fun games I have played in a long time. Before Dragon Age: Inquisition released I was so excited for to play it. However, after you annihilate the campaign a few times it can be really boring. Witcher 3 is not like that. The campaign takes way longer than that of most role playing games, yet manages to keep you excited, intrigued, and surprised. The last thing I should mention is the open-world of this game. The size of Skyrim? Maybe not, but this Multi-Region world is so huge there is a good chance you'll never see all of it. The fact that the Witcher's open-world is close to the size of Skyrim's and doesn't have an abundance of in traversable mountains, is why I'd say Witcher 3 has a better world."^5^June 7, 2015
Tasha, ^33006932^8^1^"Map: very vast, tons of things to do and explore.
Glitches: very few, especially for such a large game.
Autosaves: well-placed, so that when the few glitches in gameplay happen and you're forced to quit no matter your last save, you don't lose any progress.
Quests: tons of quests, and the feature which tells you what level you ought to be before attempting a quest is accurate.

Only 'complaint': this game is way, way too much fun. I can't get anything done. I'm addicted.

Also, even though it's Witcher 3, even if you haven't played the previous ones - like me - you aren't lost in the story.

Oh, and just FYI... they say to run the other way when an enemy has a red skull by its title. Follow that advice. Especially if there's more than one."^5^July 1, 2015

Case, ^37226114^6^1^"I didn't mind the game at all. My attention has been grabbed by a new release, however the online game play has been good for me in the Battlefield series. Being a veteran myself, first person shooters are not like the real thing, at all. I can tell you this though, if you get a headset and play this game, the hiss and cracks of the bullets and the thud of explosions is pretty spot on. Caused me to start sweating a few times. I would definitely give this game a go, the online features are fun and with the aspect of cops and robbers it keeps it interesting.
The only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars is because of the one thing I find interesting, that's the cops and robbers aspect. As a former infantry guy I will always take the chaos of the true battlefield over police."^4^June 18, 2015

This game was made developed by EA and Visceral with a little direction from DICE. The graphics are lousy compared to BF4, players have left the game in droves because of issues with out of region players as well as the overall boredom with the game in general. My friends have bought Premium for this game and still choose to play other games when new DLC is released for this one. The kicker, this game has about a third of the active players playing multiplayer that Battlefield 4(a game a year and a half older) has actively playing. Save your money for BF5(releasing in November of 2016 or thereabouts) or go ahead and purchase BF4 for 15 dollars in the meantime and enjoy it rather than this terrible game."^1^December 5, 2015

Zachnow4, ^44782723^18^5^"Well, i played the beta, and bought this the day before my birthday, mostly for family and friends, and let em tell you, if they had better splitscreen (walker assault/ multiplayer modes for splitscreen) i would have given this 5 stars... and i would still have the game. Yes, i took back battlefront, i do like a few of the multiplayer modes, like Walker Assault, but i took it back because i bought it mostly for splitscreen, and although there is splitscreen, COD actually has more splitscreen than battlefront! If Dice were to add this i can guarantee that the reviews would be better, and more would buy this, because most of the reviews i read, people wish for a better splitscreen. thanks for actually having it i guess, but they should have added more. Anyway, i am currently playing the division, which is the game i got when i took back Battlefront. So, battlefront is good for someone who doesn't have too many plans for splitscreen, and doesn't miss the old battlefront times (sittin with a friend and having chaos around every corner.)"^3^March 19, 2016
Mikey, ^44782723^12^7^"Everything is online...the only offline play is the tutorials and Survival Mode which you can split screen co-op with another person. But with only 4 maps and everything else you have to pay for PSN Now to access the online multiplayer. For someone like me who has very limited internet coverage in our area it's not worth the 60 bucks or 80 for the Deluxe. Just hoping that the expansions will offer more offline playability or a campaign mode. We shall see."^2^January 11, 2016

Only downside is that it will sometimes spawn you on top of enemies to get instantly killed or rarely behind the enemy for an easy kill.

Paige, ^44782723^3^7^"I wanted to buy this for my nephew as a Birthday gift, I put it in my basket to hold and I was going to order it the next day.

I went online to Amazon, I am new to this and I look over what they have to offer. I found out that the same exact thing for the PS4 is only $39.99 with free shipping. I order it from Amazon cause that is a twenty dollar savings. It was in my mail box three days after I ordered it.

I always thought that Walmart had the best prices on items like this but it does pay to shop around. I do not work for Amazon, I am a second grade school teacher from Cleveland Ohio who likes to save money any way I can.

I would suggest going to check out Amazon before you buy this or any other game and compare the prices it is worth it."^5^January 31, 2016

MaxBlastoff, ^44782723^2^7^"This review is for the XBOX One version of Star Wars Battlefront.

First off, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and have played all of them going back to the first 1980s arcade versions. Now that being said, I can tell you that the game controls are HORRIBLE, the WORST I've ever used in any Star Wars game, especially for the flying vehicles.

You cannot map individual control buttons. The one that bugs me the most is the left or right stick as your only choice your power/speed control button. It would be much better if it could have other button options like being on one of the trigger buttons. Also, the flying vehicles are very mushy and erratic when compared to games like Ace Combat, HAWX, and even the 1983 arcade version of Star Wars. Basically, I find many of the controls for this game somewhat clumsy.

To make matters worse, I bought it at Game Stop and when I tried to return it after 5 days they refused. They only allow used games to be returned within 7 days, so GAME STOP BUYERS BEWARE! If you must have it, wait and get it used from Game Stop so you can return it within 7 days if unhappy, or get it from someone who has a fair return policy. Also there are a lot of video glitches in the cut scenes and in the game play. I'M VERY FREAKING UNHAPPY WITH THIS GAME!"^2^December 18, 2015

Robbie, ^50183997^1^0^"It's couch coop, and much more fast paced and action packed (in comparison to the other re games). It has a ton of negative reviews online, but I think it's mostly because it strayed so far from the other formula that diehard fans have come to expect from one of these games. I think if you're not a diehard fan and just like killing zombies, you'll probably enjoy this thoroughly. The bossess are ridiculously tough though."^4^October 5, 2017
Michelle, ^54308466^14^0^"I'm a big gamer, and I recently got into the MMO scene after largely ignoring multiplayer gaming for a majority of my life. Besides WoW I pretty much played single player games. That all changed with Destiny, and after I did everything that could be done, I searched for my next fix. From its early on, The Division felt like it was marketed to the Destiny guys that ran out of things to do and wanted a a solid MMO gaming experience with plenty of things to do, and the Dark Zone to keep players hooked.

The gameplay is solid, if not a little uninspired. Shooting feels a little bland, aiming isn't as tight as it feels like it should be. This could just be my problem, however. Once I started reaching higher levels and getting better weapons, this got a little better; I don't know if I got more skilled or the weapons alleviated some of those issues, or a combination of both. The cover mechanic functions as well. I found myself pulling out of cover on accident and getting nailed, but with time, I got much better with paying attention to what I was doing. Enemy AI seems competent. You have particular enemies that employ particular strategies. For instance, there are 'brawler' types that will rush you hard with a bat or a shotgun. You've got your typical cover fire shooters, the occasional sniper, and then your elite guys which can fall in any category but have the added benefit of additional health and armor. The enemies are bullet sponges, but not so much to a fault. I would say that have the right amount of health to allow them to deploy strategic attacks on your group without feeling overpowered in the process.

The Division's structure and systems are elaborate, and you'll probably feel overwhelmed once you make it to the Manhattan for the first time. Everywhere you walk your map is bombarded with objectives; phones ringing, agent locations, encounters, main missions, etc. There's an initial shock of all this stuff to do, and feeling overwhelmed about where to even start. Once you get going, it gets really engaging. Matchmaking is excellent. It just works. I haven't had a single issue finding a team to tackle a mission or just do objectives around the map. It seems like there's a good amount of content built into the base game, but there will be those gamers that blow through all this content in no time; in fact I'm sure there's plenty that have already done so by the time I write this review.

Visual/Audio presentation is top notch. The graphics are really good. But more importantly, the ambiance and detail are remarkable. A lot of heart went into making this game look like it does. Everything is so deliberate, each room, hallway and alley has a story to tell. There's no copy and paste asset creation here; not that I could tell anyway. The attention to detail goes above and beyond what I've seen in many games in years past. In a lot ways, it reminds me of the experience I had playing Bioshock for the first time- from the aspect of attention to detail. Sound is equally as good. The ambient music blends methodically in the background; exactly what you want it to do- it adds intensity when needed and fades away while you're taking a walk through Times Square. The sound effects are great- I particularly like the satisfying crunch of a headshot with a marksman rifle. From a presentation perspective, this game gets a 5/5, no doubt about it.

The one part of the game I cannot comment on as of yet is the Dark Zone. I understand this is a huge draw for the PvP crowd, and offers a ton of great rewards for those to go exploring through it. I just haven't ventured there just yet, I'm level 17 at the moment, and I'm still enjoying the PvE and the world's ambiance.

I'd definitely recommend this game to those that were big fans of Destiny, I can see it catering to that gamer easily. As a big single player gamer, I'd also encourage other single player gamers to give The Division a try. It's a blast to play by yourself, but I find it to be so much better playing with a group. I personally play almost everything with a group, unless I'm out exploring or trying to pick up some of the collectibles throughout the environment. If you knew me, you'd know how much of a compliment this is to The Division- to get me to WANT to play with others. It's a great game, a fun way to pass the time, and a heck of an experience so far. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!"^4^February 6, 2017

I can say with certainty that this is one of the hardest games I've played in a long time. Not quite as hard as Demon Souls, due to plentiful potions, health regains on some attacks, and checkpoints, but also a bit more fair for the same reasons.

I can't stress this enough, YOU WILL DIE A LOT. If dying and retrying just to inch a bit further through a level is not a concept you're into, do NOT get this game. Each new enemy encounter will probably kill you the first time.

Don't bring less than 100% to this game or it will destroy you. Maybe somewhere down the line I might use a guide of some sort but until that time comes I am enjoying the brutal thrashings but also the euphoria I feel when I conquer a level on my own.

Side note, $40 new at the time of purchase was $20 cheaper than anywhere else. Pretty much a steal!"^5^August 18, 2015
Mauigator, ^42646929^21^30^"I get that the point of this game is that you die often and that's the charm to some people, but the long load screens to go back to the exact map where you just died is inexcusable. Then you have to go back through the same map with the same enemies in the same places to try to make slight progress before you die and have to wait a minute for the load screen to put you back in the exact same spot. It's basically the movie Groundhog Day experienced through a video game. Not sure why this game gets reviewed so well.

On a positive note, the gothic Victorian environment is pretty cool, and the ambiance of the environmental sounds works well."^2^June 22, 2016

Have been playing this level for about five days for a hour maybe hour and a half. So far this game has great system for leveling up. You have shrines located in different locationsfor saving and leveling up. I have been focused on leveling up to avoid getting stuck. Once you activate a shrine all human foes respawn. Allowing you to build your character up. This game has five weapon classes sword, dual sword, spear, axe, and the chain with hook. Allowed. to carry two melee weapons and rifle and bow. Has about eight shortcuts to use items such as healing potion and bombs. You can also use ninjutsu and magic but I have not made it that far. I recommend this game because it can definetly be played again using a different weapon class. Although you can pick up any weapon. I stick to my two classes.

Undertow207, ^36883863^12^6^"+ The game runs okay and feels great playing with a DS4. Offline mode. Definitely a great value for your money.

- Zoomed in camera (compared to the PC version), FPS drops here and there, and navigating the menus feels a bit clunky. Lacks a LOT of the core PC features. Cheaters are a major issue.

Only buy this version if you're unable to play the PC version, or if you choose to play offline or solo. Cheaters run rampant on the console versions and will go out of their way to grief you.One example, some guy came into my game as I was doing a Torment 4 rift and as he started killing stuff, I gained 1500 paragon levels within 25 seconds because he had edited gear on that added MASSIVE + XP per kill (which works for anyone in his party). Completely ruining my account as paragon levels are linked with all your characters. It's pretty obvious that the PS/XBOX versions are an afterthought for Blizzard. Seems like they could care less about cheaters on console, because this has been an issue since D3 on PS3/360."^3^October 3, 2015

Only downside is that you can't adjust your view angle, so you only see outline figures when in some tight areas. With this Evil Edition, you get both D3 and the expansion...so it is like getting 2 games for the price of one. ..Great Value!!!"^5^September 17, 2015

With the other controller , I'll be watching a movie in Kodi and suddenly, the volume drops to 0, and can't be turned back up because it's getting a constant (ongoing) 'Left' command from the Right Stick. The controllers have a life of their own! Reading online, lots of people report the same, some of them even on new controllers they'd bought to replace their old ones.

DragonManMike, ^620764180^1^0^"SO functionality wise these are exactly the same as the stock ones that come with the PS4 system. Huge difference here is the matte finish and the beautiful colour of the controller. I bought this for my wife and we were both blown away by the quality of the build on this as well as the subtle treatment of grip surface on the back of the controller, which is a slightly darker shade of red. It now looks beautiful in our living room or in my wife's hands when she is beating me at pretty much every video game."^5^March 27, 2017

Word to the wise - don't go to the store, buy the disc online there and then expect to pick it up right then and there. We decided to buy online instead of in store because the online price was cheaper. But you need to wait to get an email that tells you can pick it up, which I got the next day."^5^February 27, 2017

I have played all of the Wolfensteins to date, including Raven's dud of a 2008 Wolfenstein. Haven't seeing a Wolfenstein game in over 6 years, I was quite excited to play this.

*No Multiplayer (GOOD), 5GB day one required patch*

+ Old school appeal with new age graphics, they hit it right on the mark.
+ Throw-able knives, they are retrievable.
+ Dual wielding weapons, it does not feel awkward at all.
+ Game is extremely gruesome and violent.
+ You can pretty much play 75% of the game or more in complete stealth mode. The take downs and throw-able knives are awesome.
+ Story is actually pretty strong, it has just enough serious appeal to make it a mature game without being goofy.
+ Solid FPS controls, awesome lean/duck/cover system.
+ Manual pick up of items (armor, treasures, loot, ammo, etc). It reminds me of what old school FPS games use to be.
+ Great/traditional map system.
+ Graphics are stunning for console."^4^February 6, 2017

Zingsplash, ^36156896^37^5^"I'm 43 years old and haven't played Madden or any other video game since the 90's. I was brought up on Atari and Intelevision; that's how far I go back. I got the itch to revisit the video game world and decided to buy a PS4 and it's been worth every penny. The game system itself is mind blowing compared to where Ii left off back in the old days. I was always a huge Madden game fan and the 15 PS4 version is so impressive just for the simple fact that it only took me about 20 minutes to pick up where I left off many years ago. Sure, you can get really involved and make teams, statagies and all that but, you can also just pick it up and brush up your skills in a short amount of time and play other people at your skill level online and it's so much fun. I highly recommend Madden 15 for all of us 'old heads' who grew up playing the game and haven't played for years and of course the seasoned pros who never stopped playing.

SuperReviewer2, ^36156896^1^3^"EA has done nothing to make this next-gen. They upped some resolution, slapped on a little bit more detailed graphics, better stadiums, but textures and animation are not good. Textures do not look HD level and the animation (said to be 60 fps) is still the same OLD stiff Madden as we have know it. With systems with 8GB of RAM, this should not be. It is still jerky and the players still do not move with a silky smooth realism as should be the case by now. EA is just lazy.

The game play is more of less the same - it is football you know, so not much could change. They tweak things (giving or taking it away) for marketing purposes to make it appear to be a new game instead of an update. This game has the same handicaps and yes - the game still takes over at times (even when not touching the controller) and the game still likes to guide outcomes.

Mauigator, ^44933569^10^5^"First of all this isn't a typical hack and slasher, you have to be tactical with stealth and block or you will die . . . often. It was a bit frustrating at the beginning, but once I got used to the controls it got fun.

Pro's: Immersive environment, great representation of Mordor. Good story. The nemesis system with the Orc leaders is fun and when you die you will see that orc again . . . and he will let you know he slapped you around. Good combat mechanics

Con's: depends on your perspective, but the game is difficult. It can be frustrating at times, but also makes victories sweeter."^5^April 12, 2016

FlyntGrimm, ^25394893^1^8^"I haven't played FIFA since 02, and back then it was fun. This could be the most frustrating game I have ever played.

To start the controls seem as though they were made just to irritate. Shooting, passing and lobbing are all press sensitive. Seems like a simple concept, it is used in Madden and other EA games. However in FIFA a tap will leave the ball rolling slowly down field where it is easily intercepted. Hold the button for even a fraction of a second longer and the ball will sail into the stands. There is no finesses that the game boasts on the box.

Next your controls change in an unperceived instant when you go from offense to defense. Another thing that is good in concept. But again it only leads to frustration. Circle is used to attack the player with possession, it is also used to shoot. So when challenging your player will receive possession although it isn't apparent on the screen. The two players seem to still be challenging each other. Hit circle again to continue the challenge and you player launches the ball down field in an attempted shoot.

Continuing on. You only control either the player with possession or the closest defender. You can change manually on D, not on O. When I would attempt a long pass, the player it was intended for would just stand in one spot making no attempt for the ball. Again a defender will just run in and take possession.

Dribbling is also a nightmare. Players all have a star level. Attempt a skill out of their level and nothing happen. Even when I attempted 1 star moves my player would stumble on the ball or kick it out of their own reach. Most often though, they simply would do nothing except run straight into a defender and lose possession.

If you want to play FIFA, download it on your smart phone. I gave this game too many attempts and now it is going up for sale."^1^July 14, 2014

Yamidarkstar, ^45098357^1^0^"I've put over 30 hours into the game so far and it feels like I'm back playing my old Dawn and Dusk games from the DS again which is amazing for me. I do have a few things that disappointed me though like a fairly small pool of digimon for a PS4 game with the game being on a media format that's higher than the old DS cartridges I had hoped for a wider range of monsters to choose from and collect and was a bit sad that there was a set of old favorites that I found out after the fact were preorder only digimon. Nevertheless I would say with such smooth playing and the story itself grabbing my attention and drawing me in right from the start the few minor issues really are that only minor I intend to play through all of the story and the 4 free dlc packs then try out new game+ mode to see what all changes this game was well worth it and I would recommend it to any fan of the digimon series."^4^September 23, 2016

I got the itch to revisit the video game world and decided to buy a PS4 and it's been worth every penny. The game system itself is mind blowing compared to where Ii left off back in the old days. I was always a huge Madden game fan and the 15 PS4 version is so impressive just for the simple fact that it only took me about 20 minutes to pick up where I left off many years ago. Sure, you can get really involved and make teams, statagies and all that but, you can also just pick it up and brush up your skills in a short amount of time and play other people at your skill level online and it's so much fun. I highly recommend Madden 15 for all of us 'old heads' who grew up playing the game and haven't played for years and of course the seasoned pros who never stopped playing.

SuperReviewer2, ^36156896^1^3^"EA has done nothing to make this next-gen. They upped some resolution, slapped on a little bit more detailed graphics, better stadiums, but textures and animation are not good. Textures do not look HD level and the animation (said to be 60 fps) is still the same OLD stiff Madden as we have know it. With systems with 8GB of RAM, this should not be. It is still jerky and the players still do not move with a silky smooth realism as should be the case by now. EA is just lazy.

The game play is more of less the same - it is football you know, so not much could change. They tweak things (giving or taking it away) for marketing purposes to make it appear to be a new game instead of an update. This game has the same handicaps and yes - the game still takes over at times (even when not touching the controller) and the game still likes to guide outcomes. It always gives the player who is down a chance to come back. I wish that these games would let the player's skill control the game and not the game intervening."^3^November 1, 2014

MtnArtist, ^46137665^0^1^"If you like Assassin's Creed, you'll probably like Dishonored 2.  Because this game is based on the same style play - walking around finding things, talking to people, teleportation, etc.  If you're familiar with Assassin's Creed, you know what I'm describing.  It, of course though, has it's own unique people, objects, etc., but again, same style play.  All-in-all it's a good game, but the reason for 3 stars is because it offers only 1 campaign.  So if you're like the millions of other gamers out there with less than adequate Wifi, you'll get bored quickly playing just the 1 campaign because you're tired of struggling to play online."^3^December 29, 2016

However by some MIRACLE,  should I get the patches to download.. I'd give this title for the PS4 a 5 star  rating."^1^January 16, 2017
Mike, ^52737003^3^0^"Great game!! Super easy online order. Shipped to home as stated. Mint condition on arriva"^5^December 21, 2016
Katrinatron, ^35495972^39^0^"Loved this game. (No spoilers included in this review) The plot is solid in this one, with at least 12 hours of straight through gameplay. Plenty of side missions to keep you busy with the Riddler, Two Face, Penguin, Harley Quinn, Man Bat, Main Antagonist ScareCrow, and the newest being the Arkham Knight. There's no running back and forth to the bat cave a million times and there are three rather large islands to explore as well. The controls are good the graphics are excellent, and the cinematics are pretty awesome. But rated M for Mature, I wouldn't recommend this title for kids because of the violence and it gets a little dark in the story line. Overall, definitely worth it!"^5^August 21, 2015
Hobar, ^35495972^9^1^"Please accept the source, a 56 year old new gamer! I love this game! So many different ways to play!

Alex, ^26517548^15^0^"The story revolves around Max as he attempts to get revenge on the bandits that wrecked his beloved car. The main story missions are really enjoyable and the rewards for completing them offer upgrades for Max and the Magnum Opus. Most of your time in Mad Max will be spent driving the Magnum Opus with Chumbucket, a crazy hunchback that serves as Max's sidekick. It is the main transportation across the vast open world map full of desert landscapes. The map offers a lot of side missions to complete in order to unlock more upgrades for Max and the Magnum Opus. Most of these side-missions include various sniper posts, monuments, vehicles, and bases.

Pros:
The desert wasteland looks beautiful
The Car sound effects were great
Huge open world sandbox
Fast travel load times are quick

Cons:
Hand-to-hand combat was simple and easy to exploit
Repetitive Objectives"^4^December 5, 2015

Jr2000, ^55245720^6^138^"It has major downs in my opinion to me it seems like it's just an app based game that should be made for phones not consoles like the that they still have the old voice for the villain but it's a sad game it's just not like the old crash bandacoots its boring not fun at all worst 40 bucks I've spent can't even get my money back cuz of Wal-Mart's return policy can't go anywhere else to get my money back so in my opinion not worth buying when you can get an app that basically does the same thing"^1^August 9, 2017

DarkKent77, ^46384437^9^1^"This game is a great game if you are into games like God Father, GTA V or other games similar. The story mode is truly awesome. The music in the game is classic hit from the time period. The graphics in 4k is gorgeous."^5^January 25, 2017
Scorpanox, ^46384437^7^2^"Being from Mississippi, I can relate to this game because I have heard, from other members of my family, as to what racial relations were like during the time that Mafia 3 is portrayed. Although this time in history was set before I was born, the story and other attributes gives anyone playing this game a glimpse into what it might have been like for many in our society, such as African - American men and women, to live in such an era within our country. Although Mafia 3 was created for entertainment purposes, I would personally hope that gamer's alike would take some time to reflect from the point of view of Lincoln Clay as to how hard life was for African - American men and women, and use this new found knowledge to improve racial relations with people of all facets of our society."^5^September 24, 2017

legoleflash, ^25846150^13^4^"If you attempt to compare this to other games, you will fail and this game will fail in comparison, because it kind of lumps together a lot of games. The way it does best is as a FPS with a great multiplayer component. It is a 10/10 an that is what the game is made for, to be a shooter.

It definitely has it's problems, but considering I've played 30 hours and have only played one class (essentially 1/3rd of the game), and have still not leveled up that one class completely, this game is huge! Is it huge in terms of how much there is to explore or story wise? No. But in terms of fun and things to do, yes.

People ultimately give this game a bad rep just because it doesn't meet their expectations. Come in with a clean mind of a shooter game with some RPG elements, and you will love it. I stopped playing battlefield 4 and only play this game now. Tons of fun, especially with friends online."^5^September 29, 2014

The graphics are amazing, and I've only heard one curse word which was the 'H' word (apparently you can't say the actual word in the review).

The only thing I was bummed out on was that I was told it was similar to Halo ( which I enjoy) unfortunately it is not 2 players. I can't go on missions with him or join in on the fun, but he has a blast anyways playing solo. Other than that it's an entertaining game ."^5^January 15, 2015
DjNormal, ^25846150^6^3^"Despite the bad reviews the game has been getting, I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

I've been approaching it as more of an mmo than a shooter, so maybe that's why I feel differently.

LostInThought, ^45736611^15^2^"Shooters generally sound good to me on paper, but when I play them, they're just annoying. It's usually about going through a lot of bullets in a short amount of time, and dying, a lot. This is fun?

Destiny, however, works the way I always THOUGHT a shooter would. You can take cover and pick off your enemies intelligently, tactically. And the controls ACTUALLY WORK -- I'm so happy that I can truly AIM!

Add to this some very cool and atmospheric environments, and you've got a winner."^5^December 7, 2015

Greyleaf, ^45736611^5^0^"If you like first person shooters along the line of Halo and Mass Effect, you will like this. I list Mass Effect from a First Person shooter perspective, not from an interactive story perspective. Destiny/Taken King and expansions have more story than Halo, but not like Mass Effect.
Destiny has lots of options for special abilities and gear if you like that. This is important to being successful.
We don't have to wait long to be matched up to other players when we need to group.
The expansions and Taken King are required to level to 40th."^5^December 10, 2015

Mauigator, ^45736611^2^1^"Hmm, what to say about Destiny concisely? Hard to go wrong for under $40 dollars though a ton of value at this price. I'll just give you my opinion of the pros and cons:

Pros:
Beautiful environment, this will show off your next gen console
Great play mechanics, all the good shooter attributes from Halo
Plenty of content at this price

Cons:
Thin story even after the 3 expansions. Nobody wants to create an account and logon to bungie to read the cheesy grimoire cards
Confusing missions and raids, not sure what to do many times and need to go to youtube to figure out the point of what the game wants you to do
TOO MUCH PLATFORMING! I hate platformers where a slight misflick of the stick sends you to your death to start over. This may must be a personal issue. If you like platformers you'll be fine.
Ridiculous update breaks without warning. I was about to win a crucible match (pvp) which is hard given my lack of skill and bungie kicks me out with seconds left and forces me to update. No credit for the win or daily pvp marks.
The game ultimately ends up a tedious gear grind like most MMORPGS. You'll be constantly chasing gear while they continually move the carrot just out of reach."^3^April 12, 2016

I wish the progression were tweaked to go along with the actual performance of the players.  It's insane to see folks winning individual awards, yet their rating stays the same.

The problem is that you may need to play a lesser experience level to begin with, because the gameplay has changed drastically from Madden 15. There are options for different catch types (aggressive, RAC, and a third that causes the player to focus specifically on making the catch; falling to the ground as soon as the catch is made). The pluses are that the graphics have improved and there is less load time. I would definitely recommend buying!!"^5^December 28, 2015

LennyBlack, ^51435159^4^0^"I've been playing Madden since 1991 on Sega Genesis.  This is probably the best I've played of the series, but there's still a ton of room for improvement.  I love what they've done with the Connected Franchise mode and the addition of a Practice Squad as a means to help get rookies better while improving the team from within.  One major sticking point for me though, something I PRAY they improve for next year's game is commentary.

Playing this had me missing Nantz & Simms to no end.  I never heard of Brandon Gaudin a day in my life before I picked up this game.  I'm familiar with Charles Davis.  I'm not sure who wrote their respective scripts, but man, it was BAD.  They're not aware of which games are which (they pretty much call playoff games like they're regular season games, even the SUPER BOWL which is embarassingly bad).  It was a nice touch to have them mention what your players have done in the previous week's game and if they've either dropped off, picked up or stayed the same on a week to week basis.  But they're tone deaf to any actual moves by the franchises, as moving a team to Chicago will have them referencing the Bears not your team in the opening bit.  

Overall, I do like this game and think it's better than last year's but it's not without its hiccups."^4^February 24, 2017

Visually, most character models look like the real thing and I'm continually surprised to see how bruised/bloody the fighters can get by the end of the 5th round, assuming you survive that long.

BDBBRG, ^39969682^19^0^"Car games are becoming increasingly hard to find, especially on the new consoles. I previously purchased Need for Speed but it is solely run on-line and destroys your wireless bandwidth. In fact, no other devices could pick up the wi-fi while the game was on. Project Cars is very different. It runs on the console which frees up wireless bandwidth. You can drive all major forms of racing series, circuits, and cars. All-in-all it's a great game, and you certainly can't beat the price!"^5^April 16, 2016

SilentFan85, ^49869069^18^7^"This game is the reason to buy a PS4! Not even a PS4 Pro, but just a PS4! While the Pro does provide a 'boost' to the atmosphere of the game; the game was designed to utilize the full capability of a standard PS4. And, it looks GORGEOUS!

The combat and gameplay, overall, for this game is very reminiscent of Tomb Raider (2013). Which is a welcome thing for me, because I love the Tomb Raider (reboot) series! 

The creatures in the game are one of a kind, and were handled with care down to every nut and bolt in their body. You can see that love and care in the details of the beasts. Very creative design, as well!

This game is easily a keeper, and one for other games to be measured against. I was going to get Zelda: breath of the Wild and a Switch; but I held off after renting this game and becoming addicted. I took the game back to Redbox the next day, and picked it up at the local store here in my hometown. 

Buy it! Worth it!"^5^March 13, 2017
ObsidianHood, ^49869069^11^3^"Ok, first off let's get the basic stuff out of the way. Walmart.com shipping was fast and package came in perfect condition with the preorder bonus. Now on to the game review.

Horizon Zero Dawn contains everything I really could have imagined or wanted, and then some! Breathtaking graphics:  Check!  Fun and addicting gameplay:  Check!  Massive open world:  Double Check!!  While I'm probably 10 hours in, I feel like I've just started the story, which is massive in scale. So far the story is amazing as well! No words can describe my shock when I opened up the map for the first time and realized this massive area I was exploring was just a little speck compared to how big the map really was! (Still haven't opened up the whole map yet) Well I could talk about this game all day so I'm gonna wrap this up by saying that if you weren't sure whether or not to get this game, GET IT! You will be glad you did.

Pros:
-Intriguing Story
-Incredible Graphics
-Satisfying Gameplay
-Huge open world with many many things to find and explore
-(bonus pro) The character models are ridiculously well animated!

Cons:
-Only small con I have is the jumping mechanic can feel a bit stiff and awkward sometimes and sometimes I found scaling things a little awkward and slow but it didn't detract from the overall gameplay.

Overall score:
-I'd give it a 4.9/5 Arrows! Seriously this game is amazing!!!

Eayoung, ^49869069^4^0^"This game is superb.  The graphics are incredible and the world is free roam.  I love using strategy to take down the machines.  The side quests are entertaining and they are coming out with a new chapter this year.  This is the first game in years that has drawn me in this much and my husband and I are serious gamers.  He loves watching and he upgrades my weapons, goes to the merchants, and is equally entertained.  Keep games like this coming and I will be happy!  If you love open world maps, hunting, and exploring unbelievable scenery you will delight in this game."^5^June 19, 2017
Laurna, ^49869069^4^2^"Awesome game play."^5^March 21, 2017
SamHZD, ^49869069^3^2^"Storytelling: It's great, probably next to The Last of Us. However, the lip sync is off at times, could be annoying to some people. To me, it's a flaw which can be overlooked given there are so many other things to enjoy in this game. I think dialogues are very well written and voice acting is good as well.

Music: Pretty good music throughout the game, love Aloy's theme.

Landscape: It's a vast and beautiful open world for you to explore. Save points are throughout the map. Fast travel is easy and accessible. There are different hostile and non-hostile things to kill all over the place.

Graphics: The best till date on any console and for any games that I've played thus far or watched youtube videos, be it Rise of the Tomb Raider, Uncharted 4, Elder Scrolls Online, Witcher 3 etc.

Machines: There are different kinds of machines which are beautifully designed, with the right strategy you can kill most of them relatively easily, gotta learn how to hunt when you play the game!

Weapons: An Interesting selection that goes well with the game theme. Almost each type of weapon has something to offer, it's up to you how to use the selection that's at your disposal. I personally enjoyed most of the weapons. I usually prefer bows over guns and that's another reason for me to absolutely love this game.

Armors: Usually I do not like armors offered in most of the games after experiencing the Daedric armor in Skyrim. However, this game offers quite a few armors that are absolutely beautiful. I did enough farming which I enjoyed, unlike Elder Scrolls Online, to buy each and every weapon and armor that was available.

Game style: You can run and kill some machines or go for stealth kills using the spear, but for some, you need more finesse which would require traps and ranged attacks. I personally enjoyed different strategies to exploit most weapons.

Skills: I think skill tree is a bit brief but well explained and pretty relevant which makes it easy to know where you want to prioritize to use your skill points unlike some games which have too much going on and you have little clue how to get most out of your skill points as some upgrades are little to no use.

Crafting: This is very well laid out and you can do it on the go as long as you have enough resources. I always had plenty of resources because I spent quite a bit of time just exploring the beautiful world and farming for the resources. I think I like the fact that I didn't have to gather hundreds of things like some other RPG games. 

Collectibles: I think people who like to find each and every collectible will enjoy this aspect of the game because there are a lot of collectibles scattered all over the huge open world.

Inventory: The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. However, the modification section is a bit unorganized where uncommon, rare and very rare mods are not sorted appropriately.

Quickslots: Appropriate and easily accessible, comes handy in the heat of a fight.

Controls: Responsive and easy.

Photo Mode: You can use this feature to capture beautiful screenshots throughout the game. I've posted a couple of screenshots here. My current PS4 Theme is custom using one of the many screenshots that I have from the game.

Difficulty: I played the game on the normal difficulty which I think was neither too hard nor too easy. I saw a couple of people giving the game bad rating because they did not like the difficulty level (either too difficult or too easy), to me this is in your control and you can choose whatever difficulty you want. If you need some challenge or want to take it easy you can change the difficulty.

Issues: I have not experienced any issues while playing the game. I think some people experienced game crashing during the intro video which I think has already been addressed.

Overall I think this game is a perfect blend of primal and futuristic world with amazing graphics and story to give you an amazing gaming experience. I think each aspect of the game is beautiful and what makes this game amazing is the fact that each piece goes very well together. There is a lot to do and this game is fun all the way. I did not mind logging in countless hours into this game."^5^May 1, 2017

Dano79, ^52504861^15^30^"This game is full of bugs. I've reported every one that I can find to the game vendor @easportsnhl on twitter and they refuse to contact me back, so I am making sure to spread the word and save others from wasting their money on this game. Sure, NHL16 is missing some features, but it is also missing all of the bugs in NHL17. The passing is a joke, totally inaccurate, I pass it to 10 o'clock and it goes into the wall. The backhand shots have more power than a wrist shot on some occasions. I captured a few videos of stick glitches where my stick went through the boards and even through the ice and I was not able to control the puck, while the computer player has no problem. Do not waste your money on this game!! NHL16 should still be available at a good discount also! If you want a first hand look at the stick glitch issues, here is a link to the video I captured. https://youtu.be/jnPvt4P3NO4"^1^September 14, 2016

I had very high expectations for this game and within the first 20 minutes of game play, I realized I should have saved my money and bought a different game. The open world concept is amazing, which is what the 1 star is for. The controls are horrendous, especially when driving any enclosed vehicle. If the developers would have taken the gameplay from Far Cry Primal and inserted them into this game, it would be amazing. There is no onscreen map and you are constantly having to open up the menu app in order to see where you are. It's so frustrating trying to get anything done. You really have no special abilities like in Primevil, burn you do have a super cool dog, Boomer. This game should have went back to the drawing board and never been released. The story line is there for an amazing game, but they have really screwed up the far cry franchise with the release of this less than stellar' game.

However, the fighting portion of the game is phenomenal. The hit detection during online matches is WAY better than it was in XV1. This game in my opinion, is what DBZBT3 was to the DBZBT series.

The only downside I could think of is the character creation is a bit bland, but the outfits, accessories, and skills that you equip to your character are what makes your character stand out."^5^November 24, 2016

If you enjoy Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley! I love that it comes with the mini guidebook too (even though I purchased the full size guidebook online before the PS4 version was released!)

Jleander, ^154826768^19^0^"Bought on day 1. The environment is absolutely stunning. Amazing graphics and gameplay. This game is not for those who lack patience. Like the previous From Software titles (Demon Souls and Dark Souls/2) this game is very difficult and requires patience to learn. However, when you get a feel for the game it is extremely rewarding. NOT A MINDLESS HACK AND SLASH GAME!!!"^5^March 29, 2015
PapaGuac, ^154826768^13^0^"Excellent title. Fast and responsive combat, beautiful and immersive environments, and a cryptic story that slowly reveals itself. You must be patient if you're new to games like this, as it is very punishing, but the game is a truly unique and fantastic experience. If you're experienced with games like this though it may seem short, but still the best original title for the PS4."^4^June 21, 2015
Kannar, ^154826768^6^0^"Being a fan of the Dark Souls games to me this is one of the best games on ps4. I have almost every trophie and 60+ hours on it. Im always finding new secret dialogue and cool new combos for weapons. Its true that you die a lot... Like a crazy amount of times but when you finally get to that next lantern after beating a boss, its amazing the satisfaction of defeating a monsterous enemy that seemed undefratable an hour before. Very frustrating and annoying at times but if you put the time in to learn the mechanics and fighting styles you wont regret it."^5^April 17, 2016
SomeOtherGuy, ^154826768^4^87^"Bought this yesterday and played about 5 hours so far, complete rubbish they must have paid the critics a lot to give this such a high rating, 40 second load times, no story to speak of, you are a hunter kill everyone you meet. no tutorial and when you die albeit after 20 minute play you start at the beginning of the level with everything to do over again. You will die a lot as the combat system is truly awful so you can look forward to sitting there for 40 seconds just to have to do it all over again.

LuckyDAWG34, ^55806922^4^1^"I'm writing this review as part of a contest.

NBA 2K18 looks as polished as ever. The cinematic are a bit cheesy as they over indulge into that piece of the game, but you can tell they will continue to refine this and make it more authentic over the years. Its cheesy, but its enjoyable.

The graphics are as good as ever and the mechanics feel very sound. I'd say most notably the physics of how the players move feels much more fluid than it did in NBA2K17.

I'll be pouring hundreds of hours into this one. This is the best NBA 2K yet."^5^November 15, 2017

Online is pretty fun but not amazing, with this edition you get all the DLC(Downloadable content) which includes, all multiplayer maps, Hitman Absolution guns for multiplayer, outfits for single player and extra Tombs to raid.

There's one part where it appears to be wrapping up and I'm thinking 'Well that was a great game, if a little short', then it takes a left turn and goes on for hours more! It really feels like you are starring in a huge Hollywood blockbuster. The environments are lushly detailed, taking full advantage of the PS4's rendering power. The framerates are smooth as glass, no glitches, etc. If you have a PS4, you must get this game."^5^March 24, 2014

TheSecondFlock, ^50644527^3^0^"This game is available online for free, this version was created to appeal to a wider audience by spreading the face of the game around. It however, more than makes up it's value with additional skins, premium currency, & other items that usually cost real money to obtain within game.

The game is currently going through a lot of changes and, occasionally, growing pains,  but with updates every week that respond to fan's reactions to the state of the game, new free characters releasing every three weeks, and it's action packed gameplay, I highly suggest trying this game for free (either on your ps4 or pc), and, if you find it right for you, purchase this version to deck out your characters for a great discount.*


*Note that this game is not pay to win, the premium currency is used brilliantly through progression & pay systems to unlock/get skins, and 'cards' at a faster rate (don't worry about the cards thing, it's not pay-to-win either.)"^5^January 4, 2017

Controls are a little tricky but will come naturally given time. It's not as fast paste as games in the CoD genre which is nice for me as I prefer that. I like my games that are slower and more methodical giving me time to actually enjoy the details of the game. Graphics are amazing and the overall plot is captivating. I really enjoy the endless weapons, armor, and skill customization. Also like the fact that you can go rogue and steal from other players. Sometimes you just want to be the bad guy you know.

There they were, the division and battlefront staring at me through the glass, and because of them begging, i decided on Battlefront. After a disappointing (but kinda fun) night of Star Wars (being limited splitscreen with no walker assault, or team play, or big splitscreen teams etc.) i took it back the next day, however after i told them what the division was, they were pretty excited. They didn't really get to play, and went home, but i have had a LOT of fun with The Division, and don't regret getting it. There are a ton of guns, playstyles, gear, guns, a good multiplayer, a ton of guns... a multitude of GUNS... and the co op is great, while the Dark Zone is a bit different from your typical pvp (the clusterf*ck that is BO3) but very fun (i have only played dark zone beta, still trying to get gear) I would recommend this for everyone, even the hardcore cod player, since it is very easy to get used to. The only thing i would have to say is (i am going to get hate) why did they have to have the one GIRL mention she had a WIFE... was that to make liberals happy since the story is a BIT right-wing? Anyway, not bashing battlefront, i actually want to get it once it goes down in price, i just think you get more with the division."^5^March 19, 2016
Xaem, ^49302431^3^0^"I received as a gift from a very lovely lady. So I am going to review this.

Gameplay:

Upon first impressions the game looks amazing and feels like a desolate GTA. The controls are responsive and it is nice to see movement ultimately unhindered. The theme is awesome. It feels like you are thrown in as an agent. Playing further it appears broken due to the DPS factor.
Plan and simple, when playing a shooter DPS should not be involved when dealing with human beings.

Lets take pen and pad RPG's. We will use Palladium.

They use damage capacities. SDC versus MDC.
Structural damage capacity versus Mega damage capacity. An unprotected human body has SDC allotted to each part of the body. At 1 to 5 SDC per slot.

Most weapons do 1d6 SDC. This means if hit by a weapon in an unprotected part, the part is generally destroyed. Arm blew off, head blown off, etc.

I must saying having to dump entire clips into someones head while his friends are flanking is a big dip to the realism or fun factor. This game is no Metal Gear.

Because of the DPS mechanics a headshot is not a headshot, even though the enemy is wearing a hoodie. If the enemy had on a kevlar helmet I would give some slack. To me this is a broken aspect of the game and I must rate it low.

4/10

Graphics:
Crisp! very good frame rate for me. The lighting and shadowing make things feel almost real. A joy to look at. From the clothes to the actual hair textures for different people.

9/10

Sound:
Clear crisp sounds, very ambient. Guns sound great. Reloading changing clips sounds wonderful. Big thumbs up for the sound

9/10

Replay:

Replay on this is huge. The best aspect of the game. You will be playing this so long as DLC keeps dropping if you can deal with the DPS issue.

10/10

All in All, this game is ambitious! The theme is awesome. Had it remained a shooter with minor Call of Duty like leveling and combat, this game would be great! But it tries to hard to pull in mechanics that make more sense with swords and armor. With that said it falls pretty short for me. Too bad too because I almost thought it could light a torch to Phantom Pain. But no way short!"^3^April 21, 2016

CaliforniaCooking, ^49302431^1^3^"This game is great, have been playing since the day it came out. The game play reminds me a little of gears of war, but is still very unique. You can play by yourself and have fun, but co play is much more exciting. Discovering the city and finishing the mission has kept me locked in. I have been a strictly COD gamer in recent years, but I have played since this came out. The interface is advanced and takes a while to get used to, but it take advantage of all the controllers abilities. It also gives you tons of items in your arsenal to use. The extensive amount of detail and customization means an endless number of hours you can spend just on that. I've played so much it has started to strain my marriage. :)"^5^March 23, 2016

NeoPaladin, ^50179422^30^8^"Summary: Few games have the honor of being as highly anticipated as No Man's Sky. What was promised was nothing short of revolutionary. The scope of the game was almost unfathomable. The sheer amount of freedom and discovery gamers looked forward to with this release is nothing short of the uncontrollable excitement a child experiences the night before Christmas. Does it deliver on all the promises? Yes and no is the best answer to that question.

Graphics: The visuals are delightful and mostly on par with what you would expect from this title, technically speaking. I felt that detail could be a little higher when being very close to things such as plants and terrain. The art style is fairly unique and the palette fits well. Most colors are slightly washed', or have a pastel feel to them, adding to the unique sci-fi feel. There is a familiarity in some plants and creatures from planet to planet, but that is to be expected to some extent when considering the scope of the game.

Sound: The sound effects work well and are thought out. The technology sounds are appropriate and add to the ambience. The dynamic creature noises are interesting and even amusing at times. There's not a lot of background noises, but what is there increases the realism. The sound track is nothing less than stellar and an absolute pleasure to experience in the game.  I thought it would have been neat on the PS4 to have the system feedback announcements come through the controller speaker.

Gameplay: This is where gamers choose sides. I've seen a lot of negative feedback on the game, both from gameplay and technical issues. In a time when MOBAs and high action shooters seem to reign supreme, I was looking forward to a slower-pace exploration game. The gameplay can get monotonous for some due to the constant necessity to mine materials to charge your life support and other critical tools and systems. You fly to a new planet, start scavenging materials, possibly find monoliths and other cool discoveries that increase your knowledge of certain alien races, go to another planet and repeat. A player can take extra time to interact with the alien species, trade, and upgrade their equipment, which I find satisfying. I enjoy taking my time experiencing the different planet's characteristics, making discoveries, often renaming them, and then uploading them from the world to see. As for the technical issues, the game has crashed twice on my PS4 (which I'd not yet experienced a crash on my PS4 yet), and I've experience no issues on my PC. The framerate stutters a bit as the game is loading but after a few minutes the framerate seems solid and smooth.

Final Thoughts: I think the game is a huge success and I love playing it. I love how small it makes you feel when accessing the galaxy map and how I can take as much time as I want exploring as long as I keep my critical equipment charged. I love discovering upgrades for my multi tool and finding really strange creatures. I also love not being forced into explosive combat situations all the time. Not everyone will love the game as I can see how some would find it tedious and monotonous, but I, for one, am very pro-No Man's Sky. I love it and keep an eye out  you just might find one of the many planets I've discovered!"^5^August 15, 2016
Matt, ^50179422^17^18^"Not bad but I should have waited. This will be a 30 dollar game."^4^August 10, 2016
Ryguy, ^50179422^16^0^"Alright first off, do not go to youtube and scope out the trailers they showed for the game they are mainly false. Find some actual footage of people playing the game to see how much they really left out! I have honestly played the game well over 100+ hours to give it it's fair try and before I could truly criticize it. They did have an update for the system a few months back called 'The Foundation Update' which did improve it a little but not up to the specs of where they showed it should be. If you're looking for 'Amazing graphics' this game will let you down in comparison to Next Gen games most are seeing lately. The only true factor is yes it is endless there is no way anyone even if they played it 50 years straight would ever come close to getting to all the planets. But, on that note keep in mind as many planets as there are there maybe only a couple of dozen really because after you hit say the first 30 planets, I doubt you find any others that will really stand out as unique they all have the same skins after that. But on a positive note, it's truly great IF you love to do some exploration and just wonder around. There are many times I caught myself looking up at the sky in the night and seeing 5 planets all around me which was quite awesome simply because I said 'hey, I wanna go there right now to any of them' and could. I hope this kinda gives you a good idea of what you're getting and honestly with the price drop, it's worth it at $20. To any of the parents reading this, aside from what is a toy laser gun to Mine objects with there isn't too much violence unless you're kid just likes shooting aliens and space ships."^3^February 17, 2017
saewut, ^50179422^13^6^"This game reminds of ages past, being thrown into an environment and just figure it out. It seems simple enough on the surface but as you delve deeper into gameplay, you'll find it is not so 'simple'. The choice is yours in how you play/motivation. 

Is it work full game prices? Maybe not, but I do not mind supporting indi game companies doing something different and giving me a game type I've been waiting my life for.

Visually the game reminds me of many scifi novels of the 70s/80s I personally think this is a good game and so far am enjoying my time exploring the vast galaxies in my attempt to reach the core."^4^August 16, 2016
Choco, ^50179422^9^1^"I was a little hesitant to get it because a lot of people seemed disappointed with this game, but I'm glad I did. I love it.

Steel, ^51547601^24^5^"7 Days To Die on the PC is a great game, but on the Consoles is it a perfect port of the PC version?

No, Sadly.
Does that mean that it's a bad game?
No. While not perfect, it's still a fun game.

On it's first release for the consoles, it was very rushed and was released untested, and we can thank TellTale for that, since they're the one who were responsible for the port. It was very disliked on Critics, due to Lag, Crashing, Clunky Controls, and Tons of Bugs, but others found it enjoyable.  After almost a full year of it's release, it's now on version 1.10, fixing issues on it's first release. Some Issues are still here, but it's not as bad as before.

7 Days To Die is a Zombie Crafting Survival Open World game. You have to survive as many days as you can. Every 7 Days, a group of zombies come after your base at night. The Zombies are fast and strong at night, but at day, they're slow and weak. People says that this game is 'Minecraft for Adults,' which is understandable, since it kind of is like Minecraft, but more violent.

So far in 1.10, I'm having a blast with this. Over 20+ hours into it, and I'm on Day 15.

If you can get the Updates for 7 Days To Die, then you should get it. If you can't get the updates, then you should avoid.  I thought my 30 Dollars to buy this was worth every penny."^4^February 20, 2017

Jeffo, ^55432568^56^3^"Ive played this game for about 40 hours so far and all I can say is wow. It returns to the original Zelda format of no set structure to how you play. I was about 20 hours in before I even went to the first story line dungeon. There is just so much to explore and get side tracked by. Climb a mountain on the way to a far off village and discover 2 or 3 things you want to go before you get to you ultimate goal. Every where you go there is something that peaks your interest or it just pure beauty. This may become my favorite zelda game ever and yes ive played them all"^5^March 6, 2017
MeYeahMe, ^55432568^52^5^"After putting 20+ hours into this game over the weekend I have decided it is far and above my favorite Zelda game. My most wonderful experience so far has been seeing an island a ways off the map, getting on a raft and leaving the map to check out said island, and it has a challenge where you lose all your items and have a mission to complete on the island. I sadly didn't beat the challenge (having 4 hearts is why) but it was an experience off the map (literally) and one you had to look our for to find. The game rewards you for leaving the path that letting you run wild. I feel as if I have done so much, but at the same time keep realizing I have barely scratched the surface of this masterpiece. GOTY for sure. This game is worth both the 60 dollars for it, and the 300 dollars for the switch."^5^March 5, 2017

Most shrines are not that difficult but some are very challenging.

Chris, ^55432568^3^2^"This game is much different than any of the previous entries in the franchise as it is officially an open world game. It plays and feels like a Zelda game, but the adventure is open and free for you to do any way you want. For instance, the main objectives in this game are to free the spirits of the four champions killed by Calamity Ganon, and then defeat Calamity Ganon. If you want you can simply go ahead and charge towards Hyrule Castle and fight Calamity Ganon. You aren't required to save the four champions. Everything else in this game is running around and exploring the gigantic overworld.

My issue with this game is that there aren't really dungeons like in previous Zelda titles. The four champions are in what can best be described as mini dungeons, and they aren't that difficult. Anyone who wants to explore many dungeons, get cool items, and fight awesome bosses will be disappointed. Another gripe of mine is that every weapon in the game, including the Master Sword, can break. Once a weapon breaks, it vanishes and you have to pick something else up. While the Master Sword doesn't truly break in this fashion, it loses its charge and you have to wait 10 minutes to use it again. It's annoying more than realistic or anything I can say is a good decision.

So you have a giant, open world to explore. There are shrines, secrets, beautiful vistas, and people to meet. A problem I found is that, in my opinion, the side quests you get from exploring the overworld and meeting villagers are not interesting. The Elder Scrolls series was rooted in its excellent side quests that made the game feel like a real world. Breath of the Wild's side quests seem to be more to expand the game, and give you something to do when you aren't tackling the main quest, defeating Calamity Ganon.

It's not a bad game at all, and it received 43 perfect reviews by professional game reviewers such as IGN and GameInformer. I'm in the minority, but I don't believe this is a perfect title or the best Zelda game to be released. However, it's still fun and definitely worth picking up, especially if you get it for the Switch."^4^March 27, 2017

joecool9878, ^55432568^1^2^"Having played and beat and still own every Zelda made the only thing I did not like about this game was only 4 dungeons plus final one for 5 total. Boss on each was very similar. And the size of each was way to small a couple of flips and rotations of dungeon and it's beat. But other then that the huge open world is awesome lots of sub quests and stuff to explore. Shrine concept was ok but half of them are walk in and it's beat. Only a few had good puzzles to do. You can spend lots of hrs in exploring the game though. I put more time in this Zelda then any other but the small main dungeons   is only reason I gave it 4 stars other wise it would be 5."^4^June 21, 2017

The free roam in combination with an objective of wanted, allows for a great combination of speed if necessary, or countless hours exploring. This is also backed by a phenomenal sound track, and a great easy to learn, but difficult to master movement system. The vast amount of total moon's also allows you to put countless hours into the game, with new things still to explore. Can easily put this in my top 3 games of all time."^5^April 5, 2018

Jake, ^55885486^85^40^"I cannot believe there are full grown adults on here complaining that a kids game isnt good for adults. Sad.

Anyway, this is an excellent game. There are four beautifully designed worlds filled with platformer style puzzles which are reminiscent of Super Mario 3D world. Interspersed throughout each world are the turn based strategy encounters (think xcom).  The battles are strategically challenging, but there is an easy mode which can be toggled for individual battles if you are more interested in the story. 

The writing is filled with Paper Mario style humor. The music is energetic and engaging. The story is simplistic and is more rabbids focused although Mario is the main character and rabbids make up the majority of the enemies. 

Overall the game is filled with hours of delightful gameplay and perhaps a fair bit of replay-ability.

I picked up the splatoon 2 switch bundle along with this game and we havent even played splatoon yet since were having so much fun with Mario and his zany rabbid friends."^5^September 9, 2017
Cruz, ^55885486^41^18^"Seriously, ignore the other people trashing this game. I got this game with my Switch and immediately got sucked into it. The gameplay is turn-based, but still engaging with how the characters interact with each other. If you're a fan of xcom or the fire emblem series, this is a fun game to pick up. The story is also pretty straightforward with the rabbids being the main focus, though there are still a lot of mario elements to it. I just unlocked the multiplayer but I hear that's also fun so i cant wait to try that. 

Overall, if you're a fan of Mario and want to try out something new you should definitely pick this game up at some point. Hands down one of the best games available for the Switch at the moment!"^5^September 28, 2017

Phil, ^55885486^22^15^"Anyone who's a fan of the modern XCOM games will likely enjoy this as an XCOM-lite with its own twists, as long as they don't mind the visual direction. Much more challenging than the innocent cover implies, it's a fun turn-based tactical strategy game, with a good amount of depth and thought put into the gameplay. 

Story is basic and nothing special. Characters have quite a bit of personality. Soundtrack is well made and fits the setting. Probably my biggest surprise hit of 2017. If you had told me I would want to buy a Mario X Rabbids game a year ago, I would have said that was crazy talk.

Definitely not a game for young kids, regardless of visual direction, as one review suggested it was. It would be too challenging for most to complete the full game. Difficulty in later levels is more aimed at teens and adults. DLC is even harder. May be fine for really experienced younger gamers who enjoy strategy games."^5^December 3, 2017

halo, ^44676910^47^43^"no split screen co-op and probably 1/2 my co-op and multiplayer games online lose connection. will these companies ever put out a game that's ready? otherwise a good game. nothing special. just like 1,000 other shooters. no, the problem is not on my end and i'm not a halo hater"^1^October 28, 2015
ssgtjnelson, ^44676910^43^27^"I really enjoyed when 343 took over from Bungie with Halo 4. I felt 343 gave more personality to a character that was, otherwise, a blank template of a hero. With Halo 4 I could actually feel the relationship between the Chief and Cortana. But I don't know what happened with Halo 5. You barely see/play the Chief in favor of a really bland and uninteresting proxy... at least with the Arbiter you got an idea of his internal struggle. All the trailers led up to the Chief and Locke confronting each other (doesn't really happen). On top of that Locke was able to stand his ground against Chief in once scene... how is that possible? One was an elite soldier who is augmented... and the Chief is a soldier TRAINED FROM BIRTH, augmented, and then further enhanced by the Librarian... there is no way that Locke should have been able to last against the Chief, even for two seconds. Now, my complaints aside, this isn't a bad game; for a Sci-Fi shooter it is pretty good, it just isn't up to what you expect from a Halo game. If I could go back I would rent it instead of buying it though."^3^January 3, 2016
tcarlson23, ^44676910^42^37^"Overall, just talking about gameplay this is by far one of the best feeling games I have ever played with its 60 fps. With the new mechanics and spartan abilities, it still does feel like halo but with the added feeling that you actually now do feel like a spartan. The only issue for me is that AI friendlies are lacking quite a bit. During missions they act stupid half of the time not usually doing anything. They do not even shoot as much you would suspect. The campaign in my eyes is better than most people give credit. The graphics in this game are amazing and the gameplay is the most fun I have had in a long time playing a fps. The refresh of the multiplayer, also, I feel like has brought by the halo multiplayer that was loved so much so long ago. Even though they removed split-screen I feel this is not as much of a problem as people put it out to be as I tend to hate sharing a screen anyways on first person shooters. Halo is not the first game to reduce or get rid of split screen in the sole purpose of provide higher frame rates and better graphics. You want to play with friends? Get a couple tvs in the same room and duel it out."^5^October 29, 2015

PAC man is a little tricky to play for me due to the complexity of the controller. Galaga and Digdug are easier... Definitely not like the military games you are used to seeing on Xbox, but a nice change so I can attempt to bond with my teenager..."^5^December 29, 2016
NCGal83, ^43344553^11^1^"I LOVE this game. I have almost all of the LEGO games so I bought this one to add to my collection even though I haven't seen any of the Jurassic Park movies, nor do I plan to watch Jurassic World. This one is very fun to play. I felt that it was a bit different than the other LEGO games. It has puzzles that I haven't seen before and it has the dinosaurs! This game is worth every penny! There are four worlds to play and about 5 levels on each world. Each world represented a different Jurassic movie. I would recommend this to any Jurassic Park fan or anyone who likes the LEGO games!"^5^February 19, 2016

I took the game back to the store and exchanged it for another copy which had a different code.  Guess it is just luck of the draw which copy you get.

The developers got people from COD franchise to develop game . The shooting aspect is far superior to COD , the graphics  put latest COD to shame . I know i rented the new COD at redbox . Played 1 hour and returned it .
I have bought and played every COD made , black ops 3 was pathetic . The franchise has lost there way ; got away from what made them great .thank God titanfall 2 was there to pick up the pieces .great job EA games .keep it up ."^5^November 17, 2016
wally, ^52599739^5^4^"I was skeptical first about getting this games because I thought it would be like the last one. I really liked the last Titanfall game but it was missing a lot of stuff mostly a campaign. With this one respawn added one heck of a campaign that makes you won't more. I thank this campaign is better then the last few Call of Dutys. Now if you are looking for more stuff to unlock in multiplayer like camo's, banners and emblems this game has it plus more. In last this game is just awesome, you have to try it."^5^November 27, 2016

Mike, ^52599739^1^0^"Titanfall 2 is a very fun game. I haven't had this much enjoyment from a FPS campaign for awhile. There are some aspects of the Multiplayer that are very different from the first game. The ability to choose different weapons with each type of titan chassis is lost in the version. Instead, you have different Titan class types. Traversing the maps is as great as ever; especially, with the added grappling hook."^5^December 5, 2016
friend, ^52599739^1^0^"I loved the first so with that in mind they made the game play smoother but they seemed to strip some of the game features down while giving some new Titans and much upgradeable weapons. They made Titans with set features that are upgradable but you can't mix and match Titan body's weapons like before. Still fun to play."^4^December 14, 2016

anonymous, ^53966162^4^3^"I really like skyrim the game. It is really fun and exciting. Expectantly the Quest on it. The dragon's are really fun to fight. Elder Scrolls is really fun. The vampire's are really cool to. 
	I really like everything about it. Well most things about it. I love playing skyrim. You can probably learn from it because it's like a legit.
	The thing i like about it is the idem's and the house decoration.
The thing i don't like is the glitches because, your game just glitches when u kill a dragon or glitch in a wall.
Conclusion skyrim is really fun to play i hope people will be able to play this game sometime I have the game and I love skyrim. It is really interesting and you can learn about legit's."^5^February 21, 2017

Their was a lot of glitches at first which is to be expected with any new game especially such a big game as call of duty but all those have been fixed since.

Although I don't think we care for the first person view, this game has you looking over your shoulder at all times. It is kind of interesting though. I Really dislike the fact I can't use my hands when I want to move something around or by pressing a button I can lift cans or move bottles or boxes.
the demo scares the living heebie jeebies out of me mainly because I had to be encountered by people creeping around in the shadows.

Dakota, ^815984019^40^4^"I bought ARK when it first came out on PC roughly two years ago. It's been quite the adventure through all this time. Throughout this time, I've concluded that the concept of the game is amazing, along with the graphics, and most of the design.

However, the development team aren't the sharpest tools in the shed. They're late on deadlines, they have a hard time fixing bugs, but they eventually get the job done. I have roughly 4,400 hours into the game in counting, and don't regret a single second of it.

ARK is a great game, and I would recommend giving it a try."^4^September 3, 2017
Arked, ^815984019^18^47^"I bought this game when it first came out as early access. The concept of the game is wonderful. But the development team (wildcard) is incompetent, they can't fix any bugs, they can't hit any deadlines, and they just took customer support away from most of the servers that they saved for the early access community.  If you want to get addicted to a game only to be let down by the poor support and endless amount of bugs then this is the game for you."^1^August 30, 2017
Sirbenel, ^815984019^12^2^"First off, this game is immersive and addictive. I originally bought it while it was still in early development, like most of the people leaving comments here. I read the comments with regards to the developers and the product bugs. Until the middle of August 2017 the game was in an early release for the sake of development. This game was in early development for 2 years! Yes, there were many bugs and fixes along the way, causing frustrations, however, that's mainly from PVPers. What the negative Nancy's don't tell you is that they still play the game because it is so awesome. Everyone's initial reaction, once the game is loaded, is one of awe. Based on the number of youtube.com videos, you can see there is still a thriving community and love for this game."^4^November 22, 2017
GitRdonePhotography, ^815984019^9^13^"Odd, my highly detailed negative review is no longer here.

The multiplayer is pretty good but it's way different than the other cod games from my opinion. The maps are way bigger and the way you get your loadouts it's different and could be confusing. My advice play the story mode, play squad mode then play multiplayer."^5^November 24, 2013
tharula, ^25185716^19^8^"Don't expect to be wowed by this game. If you're new to the franchise, you may find it a enjoyable experience. But for someone who has play the series over the years, it's just the same old Call of Duty offers new. Multiplayer is the same just with some new tricks but nothing to keep you interested for a long time. Ghost's new extinction campaign is just a glorified arcade game. It's poorly designed and just not fun to play. Being able to use vehicles during the campaign was an added plus, but didn't add great value to the overall experience. Ghost is a just like its predecessors in a different package."^2^December 10, 2013

I can't say much for Walmart.com though. I ordered 2 games with overnight shipping and they just let the other one (Forza V) sit in 'processing' state for days until I went to the store, bought a copy, and canceled my online order. Kind of defeats the purpose of using the Internet to buy something. And this is not the first time walmart.com has simply 'sat' on an online order. Buyer beware."^5^December 3, 2013
Ebayfreak, ^25185716^5^5^"To those who would have thought Call of Duty: Ghost was going to be a game-changer for the franchise, you were wrong. Infinity Ward still tries to milk the franchise by making the same game over and over again. The campaign was very linear. Nothing exciting at all. I usually love to play a game and complete the campaign first, but I just couldn't do it; I skipped to the multiplayer. For being on the Xbox One, I was expecting more out of the details of the scenery, the movement of the characters, things like that. It seems like the game was rushed to meet a certain release date, not caring at all for what the audience wants.
Now, the Multiplayer. It had to be the WORST out of all the Call of Duty games. The maps were very crowded, too many areas where someone could camp (windows, broken areas in the wall, roofs, etc...), and they had no system to where they could prevent spawn-killing. They also had a very unorganized way of customizing load-outs. This is NOT a next generation game for a next generation console. But what was I expecting? It's Infinity Ward."^2^July 28, 2014
YouKiddinMe88, ^25185716^5^2^"Campaign was ok. Multiplayer is horrible. Spend 30 seconds running across a level only to get killed from behind by someone who just spawned. Game mechanics seem slow. Whoever lands 1st bullet will for sure get the kill regardless if you are playing standard core vs. hardcore. Even with the right perks, it takes a long time to ADS, so you basically always have to hip fire. You get stuck on random objects in the maps, which makes moving fluidly very difficult. I have played every COD since COD 4, and this is by far the worst."^2^May 2, 2014

MyGamerCat, ^25185716^1^5^"I bought this game for my little brother to play on his new Xbox One. He seems to enjoy it rather well, the game looks pretty nice. I myself am not a huge Call of Duty fan, if anything I'm sorta against the franchise, but this game looks promising. I'm sure people play these games for the multiplayer, which is about the same for every Call of Duty game in my opinion. The thing that makes this Call of Duty stand out from the others is the campaign, this game seems to have a somewhat decent campaign. Other Call of Duty games really like in good single player storylines, but this one actually tries. Some assets are reused, but overall it was pretty good. Extinction mode is what it is, go around and blow up alien hives. I don't believe there's a story to go along with it, but it's pretty much shoot until you clear all the hives or die. All in all, when it comes to this game, you get what you paid for. Another generic First Person Shooter with a gritty/dark setting. This one does seem to have a fairly decent campaign, but from what I can tell, the multiplayer is you standard 'Call of Duty' I suppose if it ain't broke, don't fix it? Anyway games pretty decent, it has it's fun moments, great way to kill some time."^4^December 4, 2013

I usually only play multi-player and it doesn't seem to be much different that most of the other COD games. It does have some neat features like on your charaters leveling up and the new perks. I like the new sliding ability and the fast gameplay style. I prefer it MW and Ops."^4^December 27, 2013

Tttt, ^51747224^34^9^"Poor game. They've gotten away from the core of what made Call of Duty #1. It's like they gave in to all the ten year demands of flying around, goofy ways to get meelee kills, and a repeat of B-Ops 3 with just a different kill steak and guns.
They need to stick to what made COD great and thats the gun play and good balance to the game.

I gave this game a try and was disappointed. I mainly bought it for the CoD 4 remake, but notttttt worth the high $$$ tag.

Just wait until the price lowers or they sells CoD 4 by itself."^1^November 22, 2016

Xavier, ^51747224^6^7^"Wow I xannot believe how far thia game has fallen. Just read any review online and they will rate the same rating Im giving the game. Its a continuation of cartton characters flying around with ridiculous and goofy customizations.
They even messed up the MWR! The spawns are way off and the other feature that added kills the game too.

My advice: Skip COD this years (you'll thank me later. TRUST ME!)"^1^November 26, 2016
Cssss, ^51747224^5^2^"Should have the option to purchase the games separately.  Forcing COD fans to pay the bundle price is most disappointing.  The original Modern Warfare was such a great game and  surely the remastered version is, too.  The rollback price isn't a deal, it's just a discount on an already inflated price.  The rollback cost, after tax, is roughly $64.  That's too much, should be at least $20 less.  Resist the urge to buy unless the price is lowered and the games are also sold separately."^1^December 25, 2016
Littlefoot, ^51747224^5^1^"I bought this game because I absolutely loved in on the Xbox 360.  It was the first game I ever got when I started playing Xbox in high school and I fell in love with the game.  They did a wonderful job at remastering it for the Xbox one.  I am very glad that they have not really changed anything about it from the original.  The only things I have noticed are: More slots to create a class, which is a good thing.  More camos and you can change the reticle design.  Other than that, they have done a pretty good job at keeping the game original, which is what everyone wanted."^5^January 24, 2017

Trydeth, ^41049187^21^9^"This iteration of Grand Theft Auto has brought quite a bit of improvement when one thinks about its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto 4. With the improved driving mechanics, weapon variety, and wide array of story and side missions, it's a 5 out of 5 game. That being said, I would never recommend this to one under the age of 17. This game has fully earned its M rating. Where many M rating games are purely for high levels of violence and some sexual content, this game take it to the limit, with hookers, strip clubs, gang violence and its notorious torture scene that even one it's most violent characters did not feel entirely comfortable performing. There is nudity. There is gore. There is substance abuse, and distribution. Honestly, though, this game would have been disgusting if it weren't for the satirical nature of its story. You follow the story of three men: Michael, a man with everything he wanted and feels nothing but miserable. From his cheating wife, worthless son and sexually active daughter. Franklin, an African American teen who wishes nothing more than to escape the hood and the trouble it brings, but is too loyal to those around him to abandon them. Trevor, a sociopathic, psychopathic, sadist with a drug problem who doesn't really care about anything and wouldn't mind burning the whole world if given the chance. You'll start the game with these three and even if you do reach the end of the story, even they don't feel any better about their situations, no matter how much money they may have."^5^May 20, 2015

The lengthy campaign is extremely gritty and at the same time can be hilarious. The open world allows for nearly total freedom and included multiplayer GTA online can entertain for hundreds of hours.

I had other choices, but I had never gone wrong with a Tm Clancy game nor with Ubisoft. WRONG! Having been told by the Microsoft/Ubisoft techs (3 times) to uninstall and reinstall (4 times) the game after it consistently failed in so many different episodes, (the failures were never the same...frozen shooter (agent) for no good reason; shooter would shoot the bad guy  a dozen times IN THE HEAD,  and then the bad guy would shoot the shooter dead with one shot - and then the bad guy would die; jerky game play;  while attempting to switch rifles, the pistol/shield combo would come up....AND THEN NOT GO BACK TO NORMAL PLAY!....This problem lasted through 2 uninstalls/reinstalls; and then there was the game when everything seemed to be going great, when all of a sudden, everything froze and the words FAILURE-FAILURE came across a blank screen and the game simply went out, gone...with all that night's gameplay memory. And there were so many more game-killing events.....   I was finally told by a tech to wait it out, that before the end of the year, all the problems I was having would probably get fixed.  I didn't wait. The game is gone from my console, forever banned from the streets of my XboxOne."^1^May 9, 2017

Fans will miss classic favorites like Jade, All Cyber Ninjas, and many other non-playble NPCs that were in MK9 (dead or otherwise) and it feels like they've let out so many.
Online play has its ups and downs, but unfortunately worrying about a game on last gen is what causes a game to be made w/ lagging online. (Compare to say Killer Instinct's netcode which is wonderful)
If you are a hardcore fan, or have free money to spend 60 bucks, I'd still wait till it's down to 40 or 50 cause the kombat pass is 30. Unless that goes on 1/2 off.

Kombat tower is now Living towers which is just various modifers other then mini-games, but Test Your Luck and Might are back.

No team play is gone, which is sad, but you never know 4 million sales may get them thinking otherwise.

All I can say if you are on the fence, I'd tweet Ed boon and Netheralm. the more complains of stuff left out the more they need to approach how to fix it."^4^April 24, 2015

Thanks Walmart.

Game:  Lots of gore, definitely not for the little ones.   Otherwise it's a fantastic fighting game that can take some practice to get the fatalities going.  Add on pack is a must or just get the XL version to save $$."^5^January 1, 2017

Saif, ^45702418^29^9^"So I didn't play Plants Vs Zombies Garden Warfare 1, but I did play the phone game on iOS and Android so when I heard that there is a Plants Vs Zombies 2 game coming out for Xbox One, I was pretty suspicious at first. However, I got a chance to play the beta and it definitely impressed me.

Overview of the game: This game is actually a fresh take on a shooter game with both multiplayer and a single player mode. Definitely a great improvement compared to the mobile game that they released. This is a full fledged shooter comparable to other hardcore shooter games such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo, etc. except that it is kid-friendly and instead of different guns and loadouts, you have different plants and zombies with different abilities and attacks.

I really like the innovative spin that they put on a typical shooter with their different plants and zombies with different types of attacks and abilities. It is definitely loads of fun with lots of replay value. I mainly played the multiplayer (because that is mainly what I was interested in) and even a veteran shooter gamer like me who played almost all shooters made such as COD, Battlefield, Halo, Gears of War, Resistance, etc. enjoyed thoroughly. Best part about this is that this is kid-friendly for all of those protective parents who dont want their kids to play violent video games.

However, I will have to say that this game should be priced like a typical arcade game (even though it is a fully polished game) because it would get a bigger fan base. So the price may be pretty steep, but it is definitely an enjoyable game and gives you a fresh take on typical multiplayer shooters."^4^May 9, 2016

WAX1775, ^55721872^49^74^"Same cookie cutter formula that the Call of Duty Series is known for.  Spawn Kill Die repeat in small maps.  

Too much emphasis on story, skins, challenges, and equipment.   The lobby is dry and so un-interesting, the stats are overwhelming to a point that you won't know what is going on.  

You will get owned by someone that paid extra for items and weapons when they pre-ordered the game.  

The battlefield series has it right, large maps, more weapons, vehicles, dynamic maps that change and buildings that collapse.

Kokan, ^44662950^26^4^"If you are a Lego fan, both of their games and the toys then Lego Dimensions is definitely for you.

Before buying this pack, it had been ages since I have played with my Legos, however the joy of putting this little gamepad together has brought up all those memories from before I went to college and I am starting now a Lego spree...

Game wise, its your average Lego Game experience. You choose your character, jump and solve puzzles however Dimensions does make it more interesting than before since you now have to solve puzzles in the game and in your Toy Pad by switching your toys around.

It allows local CO-OP which is great, since it allows me to play with my girlfriend on the same screen.

The only downside here is the high price tag attached to the other packs, which sooner or later we have to buy since some parts of the game require that we have characters with different abilities.

NOTE: these extra toys are not required for the story missions, at least not so far for me. You are given an option during the levels and open worlds to 'rent' the necessary character for a few seconds in exchange for some game currency (that you get from playing and stuff), this is usually enough for you to access specific areas that require a laser for example or someone small to crawl through a hole - which is a great feature."^4^January 3, 2016
debb, ^44662950^17^11^"I haven't stopped playing. Love how you can switch out characters as needed. Trying to figure out how to defeat some of bad guys is a bit tough but still an awesome game. Hope they continue to make more playable levels."^5^December 6, 2015
Kieran, ^44662950^15^0^"This game is so much fun, both playing and building the figures offers so much content. Unlike other toys to life games where the only real pourpose of the figures seem to be to take up space, this one requires the player to move the figures round on the toy base and to break up and rebuild vehicles when the game tells them to. The game is fun to play, but on the building side of things it is simple, especially the portal as the majority of it is a circle. I recommend picking this up if you have a console to play it, especially now that year two is out."^4^October 28, 2016

VariousBones, ^37202059^3^0^"If you have never played a Lego game before, this is as good a place as any to start. If you have played, then this should be very familiar to you. Me and my son have been playing this game for a while now, and while we were able to play through the main game in a day, there are many more things to do after the conclusion of the story mode. The levels are all unlocked for free play (playing through the level again with different characters whose abilities can unlock new things you didn't have access to the first time through), but not only that, there are many other missions available from characters that are hanging out in the menu hubs. Unlike Lego Marvel Superheroes, there is no open world free roam as you were able to do in New York City, however you are able to visit other locations to find new challenges and characters. Another new and welcome innovation is that if a character like Batman or Robin is required to change their suits to complete a task, you do not have to open the menu to change the costume, but instead approach the challenge and hit the prompted button (B button) and it automatically changes to the correct costume.

There are quite a few new and exciting characters as well, many of whom I've never heard of, and many voice and lego character cameos by folks who have been associated with some of the DC franchises or comic book world. The controls are fluid and smooth, similar to Marvel and the story does a good job of keeping things fresh and interesting with the humor that Lego games have come to be known for. I gave the game a challenging rating because there are some missions whose solutions are not always obvious and you have to perform a bit of trial and error to discover the correct path. Some folks might be deterred by this (as my son was at times) but we have yet to encounter something that we could not accomplish without a little thought and the proper character.

Overall, a great game that has provided me and my son with many enjoyable hours of gameplay.

Enjoy, and happy building, er, I mean, playing!"^5^January 19, 2015

Christopher, ^45463243^3^1^"I started the tomb raider series with the 2013 edition when it was free on the 360. That game was fun and had great graphics. This game has improved in every single way, so much so that it feels like a different game entirely. But that's a good thing. The action sequences are completely immersive, the crafting is now expansive and varied much like far cry, and the graphics are of course superb. My only real complaint is that the tombs/story levels are somewhat easy to navigate. I think a lot of loyal fans will not like this aspect but for me personally I enjoy this game as sort of an interactive movie that is easy to participate in. I like the fact that I can just sit down and enjoy the beautiful graphics and have some fun action sequences riddled in. It feels like you're actually the beautiful, fearless adventurer Lara Croft. I give this crypt quest 5 ancient relics out of 5."^5^December 6, 2016

With the other cars introduced there are 8 that I don't have, but I don't like the DLC model of most games so I won't be buying those. That's more of an FYI if you're worried your kids going to rack up some charges."^5^February 26, 2017

Huebdoo, ^55115863^9^3^"I am a gamer that loves games like Fallout 4, Skyrim and alike and Mass Effect: Andromeda is a simply beautiful game that delivers some of the best dialogue, plot lines and character development in a game I have ever seen. At launch, there was a great deal of negative media regarding the 'Eyes and facial expressions' of the characters in the game, however, I never witnessed this after the patch was installed upon purchase.  Once you install the disc there is an update rendering the old game version replaced. 

I have two teenagers at home that also play this and are completely immersed in the characters storylines and the development of the crew on the 'Tempest' the ship that the characters explore on.

Simply put, if you want more than a simple shooter or puzzle game this game (and the series franchise for that matter) are an excellent example of the evolution of the gaming technology."^4^May 5, 2017
HonestGamer, ^55115863^8^34^"This game should be given 0 stars. It's absolutely horrible.
Not only are the facial expressions and animations outdated and shameful for a console like the Ps4, but the story is just as bad, if not worse. 
I would never have guessed Bioware to manipulate such a popular title, like Mass Effect, to suit their own Social Justice Warrior agenda. 
This game is FILLED with REAL LIFE political issues, social justice ideals and of course, feminism. If you enjoy seeing women control everything and men beg for help, buy this game. 
If you enjoy ugly facial expressions, buy this game.
If you enjoy 3rd grade dialogue spun into a boring story....buy this game.
Don't waste your money. Plus, lots of other places online sell this game for a cheaper price. The game hasn't even been out for a full month and you can already find it online for around $40.00. That should tell you something.
This game is bad. Run away."^1^April 3, 2017

TSlice, ^43172613^13^2^"This is a fantastic deal. Two excellent games with all the DLC included, with some texture upgrades and a far smoother framerate than the 360 version. If you've never played Borderlands, it is a crazy fun loot-based shooter with the best humor I've ever seen in a video game, great to play both by yourself and with friends. Speaking of playing with friends online: I've never had an issue doing that, so please don't put a lot of stock into what my fellow reviewer said.

Bottom line: one of the best value pickups you can get for your Xbox One. Guaranteed to keep your entertained, laughing, and ever searching for better loot for hours on end."^5^September 24, 2015

Phil, ^43326858^11^3^"I purchased the Xbox One at Walmart on sale for $299.99 which included a free download to a game which I really don't give 2 hoots about. I purchased Forza 6 at the same time. I made the purchase just to get at the Forza 6 Game. I had heard about great reviews & like car racing games. I just had to let the prices come down. What I do give a couple of hoots about is Fonza 6. All I can say is if you do not have it, your missing out big time. This is by far the best I've seen ever. Play Station will have to work hard to beat them for the PS4. I am a 50's, 60's & 70's classic car enthusiast & really was just getting into it when Slo Blam. I won Christine in a race. I seen the win come up & was puzzled so looked around & found her in my Buy A Car File. Since she was a race win prize the cost was free. I bought the freebee & hooked her up with some awesome powerful upgrades. Off to the Free Races & man what a ride. I love bogarting my way thru traffic with this tank. Sounds awesome too, my very 1st 1958 Plymouth Fury, I'm still grinning ear to ear. This game has all the big muscle cars & I managed to win enough races to get most of them. I seen a few I will buy in power up purchases. Finally a real game with real cars & graphics that are simply amazing. Thanks Xbox One & Microsoft.

MJMII, ^30534324^1^0^"If you liked Dead Rising 1 & 2, you will like this! It's got a pretty good story, and multiplayer with a friend is real fun. Combo vehicles destroy zombies like they're nothing, and are a treat. New combo weapons are great, and the skill building system is chief. You can choose which categories to rank up, as opposed to 1 & 2 where it was automatically decided. The map is pretty large. Bigger than both others combines I believe. Give it a try!"^4^July 31, 2014

Mikel, ^45611534^7^11^"Let me start by saying the item itself arrived in perfect condition and I love ordering from walmart.com but this game has got to be, very literally, the buggiest game I have ever played, in my life! I've been a big gamer all my life, am very familiar with Bethesda games, and even spent probably 1000's of hours on Morrowind back in the day. But not even in the 90's did I come across a game so glitchy. In my just few days of gameplay so far, i've gotten trapped in a desk I suddenly phased into, witnessed random enemies glitch through or into walls, I've phased through the walls in yet another town in the game and had to restart just to be able to climb stairs again rather than walk through them into an empty void of nothingness, and just last night after crouching in the wrong place caused me to sporadically glitch-die, I spent an hour or two of trying to build a settlement when the game suddenly just froze up and restarted itself, yet again losing all my progress. I'm honestly not even that frustrated, just in complete amazement and aw that this it sold as a finished product."^1^April 2, 2016

anonymous, ^45611534^5^0^"Fallout 4 is a open world shooter with a stellar story line. It starts in your house in a place called sanctuary with your wife and son. You can model your character and change your gender. The world they live in is powered by nuclear energy which eventually causes a fallout. Then your character wakes up in a vault with his wife in front of him and a guy walks up and takes his son and kills the wife. Then the husband makes his way out of the vault and when he gets out he sees nothing but wasteland. He goes down to the town in search of his robot codsworth. He finds him and ask him what happened and where is his son. The robot responds look in diamond city. On his way to diamond city he finds this dog named dogmeat. He and the dog join together and make their way to diamond city. In the game there is perks that help you and armor and weapons to protect you from dangerous creatures and mutant humans. The game mechanics are smooth and feel good. There is a variety of weapons and missions to do. Overall i give it a 9/10 rating and definitely worth buying."^5^February 21, 2017

I don't play Xbox so I don't have a clue what's the latest hot game is other then by doing a search. Fallout 4 came highly recommended by previous purchasers and as most sources were already sold out, I figured it must be 'good'. Walmart had it in stock at a reasonable price so it all worked out. As far as the game goes, the graphics do look really good and who can't love an end of the world game anyway, right?

Kokan, ^44662950^26^4^"If you are a Lego fan, both of their games and the toys then Lego Dimensions is definitely for you.

Before buying this pack, it had been ages since I have played with my Legos, however the joy of putting this little gamepad together has brought up all those memories from before I went to college and I am starting now a Lego spree...

Game wise, its your average Lego Game experience. You choose your character, jump and solve puzzles however Dimensions does make it more interesting than before since you now have to solve puzzles in the game and in your Toy Pad by switching your toys around.

It allows local CO-OP which is great, since it allows me to play with my girlfriend on the same screen.

The only downside here is the high price tag attached to the other packs, which sooner or later we have to buy since some parts of the game require that we have characters with different abilities.

NOTE: these extra toys are not required for the story missions, at least not so far for me. You are given an option during the levels and open worlds to 'rent' the necessary character for a few seconds in exchange for some game currency (that you get from playing and stuff), this is usually enough for you to access specific areas that require a laser for example or someone small to crawl through a hole - which is a great feature."^4^January 3, 2016
debb, ^44662950^17^11^"I haven't stopped playing. Love how you can switch out characters as needed. Trying to figure out how to defeat some of bad guys is a bit tough but still an awesome game. Hope they continue to make more playable levels."^5^December 6, 2015
Kieran, ^44662950^15^0^"This game is so much fun, both playing and building the figures offers so much content. Unlike other toys to life games where the only real pourpose of the figures seem to be to take up space, this one requires the player to move the figures round on the toy base and to break up and rebuild vehicles when the game tells them to. The game is fun to play, but on the building side of things it is simple, especially the portal as the majority of it is a circle. I recommend picking this up if you have a console to play it, especially now that year two is out."^4^October 28, 2016
LegoMom, ^44662950^13^1^"Everything was included in the box. Easy set up directions. The kids enjoyed putting the legos together. Everything hooked up easily to the the TV. Works great! Very pleased with our purchase."^5^January 9, 2016

cons

After buying it, I made my way to the electronics department and there was this videogames display. As I approached it, a game caught my attention. I looked at it and said to myself, 'Wait a sec, this can't be it? Walmart website says, 'It is not available in store' Am I dreaming? Could it be my eyes are playing tricks with me? To make sure it is neither, I picked it up and held in it in my hands. I read the title to make sure it is not a misprint. And then bought it!

missch19, ^45630778^5^1^"This game is pretty fun but can also be challenging! There's a nice mix of single player, duets, trios and more making it fun and interactive for the whole family! The kids love it, and I've enjoyed that there is a 'workout' option to it, which allows you to play multiple songs closer to one another (less break time between each so heart rate stays up) and is fun! Only reasoni gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that you have to pay extra for some songs."^4^February 17, 2016

There are about 30 songs to dance to (unless you purchase unlimited membership) from all different artists. I didn't like this one as much as I like the 2015 one due to it being very similar to the 2015 one and not that great of songs (not many popular songs).

TSlice, ^43172613^13^2^"This is a fantastic deal. Two excellent games with all the DLC included, with some texture upgrades and a far smoother framerate than the 360 version. If you've never played Borderlands, it is a crazy fun loot-based shooter with the best humor I've ever seen in a video game, great to play both by yourself and with friends. Speaking of playing with friends online: I've never had an issue doing that, so please don't put a lot of stock into what my fellow reviewer said.

Bottom line: one of the best value pickups you can get for your Xbox One. Guaranteed to keep your entertained, laughing, and ever searching for better loot for hours on end."^5^September 24, 2015

Pro Street had the customization, Rivals had the open world, and now they FINALLY brought it back together. AT FIRST there are limited custom options, but that's because it is all unlocked as you level up. Once you're in the 30s-40s (it only takes a few hours) the options are limitless! Love the game, and love the online features (points for simply driving and 'Hooning' with friends). Can't recommend this enough!

My 6 year old is obsessed with LEGOs and can now recognize dozens of Marvel heroes and villains having never read a comic. I'm so proud.

Those of you that have played the Lego games know that the developers have struggled to get the 'Hub' players can explore and find characters and special bricks just right since Lego Star Wars. Lego DC's hub was confusing, this one is easily the best yet. The game levels are a boatload of fun, can't think of a bad thing to say. Pick this game up, you'll love it no matter your age!"^5^February 11, 2014

Midnighthobo, ^26680690^8^0^"Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a fantastic game. If you have played any of the other Lego video games you know what to expect. This one however has a TON of content. There are 15 story missions (by my count, I may be slightly off), each pretty long. Even once you beat the story, you are just beginning. There is SO much more to do if you want to get all the collectables, unlock every character, etc. Speaking of characters, there is a MASSIVE amount of them. Seriously, watch a youtube video of this game and see for yourself. You will need them too, because to get 100% in this game you will need a hero that can reflect lasers, someone who can control minds, someone who can sneak past security cameras, someone who can freeze water into bridges... Really, the list goes on. And the best part... going back and getting all the items hidden throughout the levels is actually FUN. It doesn't feel like a chore like most games.

All that would be a fantastic game, and I haven't even mentioned that you can run around New York City between missions and play around. There are a ton of side missions, hidden items, unlockable characters and vehicles, etc, strewn around the city. I've spent an hour just roaming around before remembering that I had a world to save.

This game has drop-in/drop-out multiplayer (on the xbox one that I use, I can't speak for every system) that makes multiplayer just the best. You can just jump right into a game with the press of a button, no pausing, no menus. I wish more games had this functionality.

The only downsides might be that it's pretty family friendly. The jokes are all age appropriate (usually a little cheesy) and there isn't any blood and guts. This might scare off the 'hardcore gamers' who live only for hyper violent games and scoff at anything 'less'. I really can't praise this game enough though, and if you are looking for a fun game to play as a family, this might just be it for you. And honestly, this is pretty fun to play alone late at night when everyone else is sleeping."^5^February 2, 2014

Coleman, ^44910202^6^2^"Ever since I was a kid I grew up playing video games and call of duty has always been one of my favorite games to play. If you've ever wanted to join the army, fight terrorism, and go on secret missions in other countries,Black Ops 3 might be the game for you.

	Black Ops 3 takes place in the year 2065 a time where soldiers are given cybernetic enhancements to battle against robotic super soldiers. Because of this there are more controls for you to learn how to use, so if you are still not comfortable with the basics, this game might be a challenge. While on duty you will be shooting, jumping, and sliding all across the battlefield.

Black Ops 3 has 3 main game modes: campaign, multiplayer, and zombies. The campaign tells the story of you and your partner traveling across the world to carry out missions for the CIA. multiplayer is a competitive online game mode where you fight people in different game modes including: team deathmatch, capture the flag, and domination. Multiplayer is best played when you have an online connection otherwise you are just fight bots. Zombies is a gamemode where you fight off a zombie horde with the guns you find on the wall and mystery box. With every bullet that hits a zombie the more points you get to use to buy better guns, perks, and weapon upgrades. 

The  DLC in Black Ops 3 makes the players experience more enjoyable, but is not required to play. If you buy any DLC pack it will come with 5 maps: 4 for multiplayer and 1 for the zombies gamemode. Most of the multiplayer maps are nothing special, but if you are a big fan of zombies then DLC is a must.

This game is best played on PS4, Xbox one, and PC, but are available on Xbox 360 and PS3 as well. If you are playing on the PS4, Xbox one or PC the graphics for this  game are, in my opinion, top-notch. Everything from the building's to the player models are very realistic and stunning. I would not recommend getting this game for anything that isn't part of the new generation of consoles because the graphics on older consoles are much worse than on the newer ones. Some features are also taken away on older consoles.  

Black Ops 3 is being sold new at gamestop for $60 which is standard for new games usually. If you think you can handle the control updates, and you have $60 dollars to spend I would highly recommend getting this game. This game has given me a lot of joy from the time I have played it."^5^October 3, 2016

Trearch shows sledgehammer and infinity ward how to make a fun competitive shooter that any one can be good at. 8/10.

TheAssembler, ^44910202^1^2^"Not happy about the game.
Firstly, the game will only allow players to join lobbies online to play against high level players, there are no low level online modes for players who are new to the game, to learn, to get used to controls, to gain experience we must have the ability to orient and play without being dominated by players only there to wolf pack you or to points grab.
Secondly, I disliked the Zombie mode, it lacks any imagination, you get one level, one board and you have less than one square block to fight in. the game is not complicated but when you have 50 zombies running at you, you have nowhere to run or hide and no way to earn points after 6 rounds.
Thirdly, The story mode is difficult on the easy setting, it doesn't allow you to use special moves except when IT wants you to, only giving wall run during certain parts of the game and then only swarm during other, robot control, etc.
The game makes me angry for this reason, instead of teaching you and allow you to perfect the ability they dangle that ability in front and then yank it away and force you to work 10 times as hard to get the results.
Fourth, I selected new skin for my character, new suit and helmet, the story deliberately ignored the selections and placed the character in game in his normal player outfitting. A severe problem for those of us concerned congruity and continuity in game.
Kind of like placing a camo on a rifle in the mod shop, then immediately walking to battlefield and it is not there, because programmers are too lazy to write up solution that makes your gun look like you wanted.
Finally, the cast, not really a bad cast, aside from a few of the women characters who are unknown or unfamiliars, there are a few you will immediately recognize, Taylor, your lead character and another. All famous actors.
There are sadly no saving graces for the game.
I played the demo and was boycotting the game for nearly 9 months, because of the noted issues, I should have held my ground and remained a boycott holder for this piece of garbage."^3^February 20, 2016

Bubbyheadjones, ^45736614^6^27^"For years I have been a fan of bungie, playing halo and playing destiny(since beta). I used to be a huge fan of bungie until they showed how much they really care about their most loyal fans. Last year I bought the 80$ collectors edition of destiny. The game had been my go to get away since it launched. I bought every expansion, had 3 characters and had spent weeks of in game time. Since I enjoyed destiny so much I thought it would be cool to own something THAT ALMOST NOBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE! I enjoyed being able to flaunt my special gear in the tower and reef. However I was given no indication that this gear would be given out FOR FREE at a later date. I spent my money and time for something that was ultimately free and common, even though I was told that it was a RARE collectors edition, only available for a limited time! It is my belief that bungie is a dishonest, manipulative company that cares more about its revenue than its customers. I am deeply dissatisfied with bungie and destiny and will not be buying the future dlc that I have been waiting months for. If you read this bungie I hope you know how many people out there you have disappointed and driven off with your decisions and actions!"^1^July 26, 2016

Sad Panda, ^193294052^2^0^"The graphics are awesome, and the mechanics are fine tuned. Same GOW game you love, but just improved. Seriously, I tried going back to the other ones - they don't hold a light to this one. Spoiled us on this one. Campaign was okay. It really focused on 'horde mode' mechanics and borrowed some grace from previous GOW release plot and play devices. I also disliked the all new cast members. They are are shallow and desperate. Multiplayer is the best it's been. You can chose to play the way you're comfortable with - competitive, socially competitive, humans vs bots, horde 3.0. They've introduced booster packs (which I'm not a fan of) which are cards that add perks to the game. In the past, the series allowed you to unlock new player models and skin weapons as rewards for progressing through any online play (including campaign). Now it's all choked through the booster packs. You can earn gear credits for winning or successfully completing goals in versus modes. It takes anywhere from 4-8 hours to rack up enough credits to afford these rewards. How they pipeline you is to purchase these pack instead. They have almost no effect to the game play, with the exception of the horde skills. Horde skill are cards that allow you to buff skill sets of the archetype you pick to survive with (solider, heavy, engineer, sniper, scout). There is also a season pass available for an additional heavy cost, but holds no true value. All maps come out a few weeks earlier for pass holders to play on with special community events. They are later released to the full community to play online for free. Over-all, I like this game. I stink at the multiplayer and wish I had more friends that I could play with. But such is life for a middle aged person with a family. The end."^4^November 25, 2016

pearlygirly1965, ^45923158^0^2^"In this game you are tested to the very last inch of your skill of the game.I cannot remember if it is the hardest game in the world or not so don't quote me.I think that the game is very versatile and hard.For a little bit I had a problem with the controls because I am mainly into RPG games so I had to get used to the controls.If you are a playing this game without playing the others you are going to have a hard time beating bosses and higher geared enemies.If you are one of these people you need to at least borough a friends account on Dark Souls 3 and go in and use there higher up character to fight until you are used to the controls and then you might have some leverage in the game.The part that is most confusing is how you block and attack.The reason they confuse me is because I have never had to use right and left bumper ever in a game so when i am playing and i try to block I instead pary and get attacked repeatedly.

I personally did not expect to like it as much as I did: I would definitely recommend this to anyone who owns an Xbox One, or to anyone who loved the Zombies mode from prior Call of Duty games.

Added enough new stuff to make it interesting again, while keeping the same tight controls. Enjoy my time with COD:AW. People love to hate the COD franchise, but it still sells like hotcakes. There is a reason for that, and no, its not because theyre all dumb and 'don't know good games'. I am 34 and have gamed since the Atari 2600. I have nearly 400 games on Steam, and hundreds of games on consoles from the Ps1 to the Xbox One. JRPG's, Strategy, MMORPG's, obscure japanese titles, shooters, racing simulations, and everything in between."^4^February 7, 2015

FrozenFox21, ^36883865^14^0^"The game is a dungeon crawler, pair up with friends locally or online. The awesome thing is that you and a friend without a gold account can pair up and go online together. There is a huge story line with nice cinematic, and plenty of customization without it being so cluttered that it doesn't matter. My only issue with the game is there's a relatively small amount of players online to pair up with and the game will award you for playing with people. So unfortunately the harder it is to find people to play with, the harder it is to level up and get to the end game content. that being said, it's a very fun game with everything you want in a dungeon crawler. traps, vastly different mobs, and plenty of hidden jokes if you don't mind reading now and then."^4^December 10, 2014

dogsarelikekids, ^47187984^41^12^"I loved Star Wars Battlefront 2, but was just a tad disappointed by this game. The game does look and sound beautiful and I have no issues with the controls. I just really miss playing through some sort of story mode. The game is a bunch of matches or mini game type things that you can play single player, couch co-op, or online. The games are fun, but get boring after some time. If you are playing with friends, I assume it stays fun. Playing solo got stale after a half a day. It does make the Star Wars universe come to life and gives you a taste of certain aspects I always loved - ATATs, speeder bikes, X-Wings, etc. I will keep the game to every now and then dive in, but it is not my go to game."^3^December 7, 2015

MaxBlastoff, ^47187984^2^10^"This review is for the XBOX One version of Star Wars Battlefront.

First off, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and have played all of them going back to the first 1980s arcade versions. Now that being said, I can tell you that the game controls are HORRIBLE, the WORST I've ever used in any Star Wars game, especially for the flying vehicles.

You cannot map individual control buttons. The one that bugs me the most is the left or right stick as your only choice your power/speed control button. It would be much better if it could have other button options like being on one of the trigger buttons. Also, the flying vehicles are very mushy and erratic when compared to games like Ace Combat, HAWX, and even the 1983 arcade version of Star Wars. Basically, I find many of the controls for this game somewhat clumsy.

To make matters worse, I bought it at Game Stop and when I tried to return it after 5 days they refused. They only allow used games to be returned within 7 days, so GAME STOP BUYERS BEWARE! If you must have it, wait and get it used from Game Stop so you can return it within 7 days if unhappy, or get it from someone who has a fair return policy. Also there are a lot of video glitches in the cut scenes and in the game play. I'M VERY FREAKING UNHAPPY WITH THIS GAME!"^2^December 18, 2015

Story mode is super interactive,battle mode is EXCELLENTLY done with tons of different end of battle images/special team combo images/jutsu's/more,and a adventure mode once you've finished story mode! And of course when you order the Road To Boruto version (which you can also buy the DLC for if you already own the game without it) you can unlock many Boruto characters and the older versions of some of your favorite Naruto characters! (Naruto,Sasuke,Sakura,Hinata,etc) Everything loads extremely quickly and I personally haven't encountered any glitches or freezes. I bought it months ago and I still play it regularly! It's a must have game for anyone who enjoys the Naruto/Boruto series!!! I can't recommend it enough."^5^December 5, 2017
GregPA, ^25394847^64^17^"Let me first off state that I have been playing First Person Shooter Games for the last 12 years starting back in the days of Golden Eye, then Halo 1, 2, 3, Reach, and 4. I then switched to Call of Duty from Modern Warfare 2, Black OPs, Modern Warfare 3, to Black Ops 2. I have always been mainly an online player and skipped the campaigns. I prefer real life competition. I consider myself to be a top gamer and try to always come in first place every game I play. In Black OPS 2 I was rated a Master ranking for Team Death match. Currently I own the Xbox 360, PS3 and the new Xbox One. Now to Battlefield 4

When this game was first released, there were many bugs made the game feel incomplete and would hold back your complete satisfaction with the game. It is now about a month later and most of the bugs are gone. Some of the bugs were not being able to save the campaign mode at all. I was two hours deep into the campaign already and tried to save thinking I could come back later. But to my surprise and dismay I had to start from the beginning again. I was not a happy camper. But its fixed now.

Weapons and Guns - each weapon is much more realistic in this game than Call of Duties. You have to account for bullet drop from long distances, fire rate, leading the target more when they are moving, and there is a lot more customization of each weapon with different attachments and barrels.

Although there isn't kill streaks that give you a super power up like a chopper, pred drone, UAV, and care package, ect the game includes different starting packages that are completely customizable. I play as a medic so I can revive people when they die within five seconds plus dish out health packets to damaged teammates. There is also a ammo 'supplies' class and a 'recon' and 'engineer class. Each have their own pros that they bring to the table. Have a team together online and they can work together with the different classes very well.

Overall I think the game has much more versatility, action, more enjoyable than Call of Duty could hope to be. I heard many of my friends who tried to get me to play Battlefield over Call of Duty say this to me. Call of Duty is for kids Battlefield is for adults. I couldn't agree more after playing it.

Buy this game, you will not regret it."^5^December 24, 2013

Plus, with the way multiplayer unlocks are designed, I feel I'll get enjoyment from it for a long time. However, like BF3, there's a premium package you can get at $49.99 for all the addon content plus some exclusives. Kinda like buying another title to supplement the title you just bought. It's a tad ridicilous, but way cheaper than paying for individual map packs... They got me on it, so be prepared to spend extra for the 'full' experience."^5^January 17, 2014

BygoneSamurai, ^25394847^2^0^"Battelfield 4 on the Xbox One is amazing. If you liked this game on the Xbox 360 and plan on getting an Xbox One, the upgrade is well worth it. You can expand your gameplay from the usual 12V12 to 32V32 in multiplayer or you can just stick with the 12V12. The maps are expanded and you have more room to roam and find better hiding spots for you Snipers. There is more detailed environments, more vehicles per map, and team play is expanded greatly. If you were tired of all the glitches and freezes that use to happen, the new Fall update fixes all of them and improves a lot of things in the game.

I enjoyed the online play for the PS3 version but I have started to think that 2K rushed this product. Online play is ok, but no franchise mode and tough to get into leagues.

Mnparents12345678910, ^40835503^1^2^"Bought for my husband. He says it's fun and it fits the MX vs ATV series very well, but it's not exactly revolutionary. Graphics aren't great (even for last gen systems) and the sounds are kind of annoying. There are some real life riders, but no big names and there are realistic tracks and real locations to compete on (though the stadiums are generic). The bottom line is that this game is arcade style fun and it is a 'bargain' title after all, so don't expect too much. It's similar to past titles in the MX vs ATV series so if you liked them, you'll probably enjoy this entry in the series as long as you don't expect a revolutionary game.

Great for playing with kids, for kids or if you have some down-time to waste."^3^December 31, 2014

TBood, ^25394878^58^27^"Now, this game is very addictive and fun when you are playing alongside friends..But i recently had my game crash and when i rebooted the game my game progress had been reset back down by a considerable amount! I had contacted EA and spoke with a 'advisor' and he said there was nothing he could really do but pass my case up to people who would try and figure out what happened, but they would not be able to restore my game progress... I then went on to start leveling up again but it again crashed and my progress was reset....

After i poked around on the EA forums i found tons of people have had this same issue since it's RELEASE and EA has failed to fix this persistant issue!

While the game is quite fun when playing with friends, i would not recommend picking up this game as this bug really does ruin the game.."^2^April 29, 2014

Skid, ^25394878^5^0^"It is fun to race around, escape cops or bust racers, but the method to progress is highly unrealistic (which add to excitement).  But to gain money and nitrous by breaking driving laws, get repair by simply passing through a gas station, or hide in a building from 10 cops after just pressing a button seems way to easy.  It should be harder to get back into a race after wrecking or getting busted."^4^December 26, 2016
distant316, ^25394878^5^1^"The graphics awesome, the game play great, the bugs can be frustrating if you crash in mid jump, and the only negative thing I can point at is that it has no real story line for either the cops or racers making the game feel that once you get your racing fix its off to something else."^4^February 13, 2014

threecommas, ^25394878^4^4^"Don't buy this if you're looking for racing simulation  la Forza or Gran Turismo. There is no departure here for the next gen platforms. This game follows Need For Speeds tried and true super fast arcade style racing, but it does so in a franchise reviving fashion. NFS games tend to great or less than-great from year to year; this is one of those great years. Back are the white knuckle police chases (you can play as racer or cop), spectacular crashes and over the top speed bump and hit racing. The formula is dead on and it works, all while looking fantastic on next gen systems. Improved lighting, beautiful cars that get authentically dirty as you race, fantastic weather effects, heart pumping engine noises, overall gorgeous visuals and crisp audio. The controls are a little loose as exoected from a nfs game, but they work here. If you enjoy fun racing without the simulation, this game is for you."^4^March 9, 2014

In this fantastic world, you are deemed a chosen one, meant to help save the land from a dark force spilling demons and more from rifts in the sky. You can take on special assignments while exploring the lands. Fantasy creatures roam the landscape. Improve your weapons, strength, etc., as you battle enemies and complete assignments. You can choose which assignments to take on, and you will have a team of three other characters with you. Eventually, you will be able to choose from several different characters to make your team. You will interact with characters throughout the game. Multi-player with online play is fun as well. You may invite friends to play or let the system choose players for your team.

Also defeating a monster is very rewarding.  The weapons feel very good and each one is unique . No weapon type is better then the other they all have different strengths and weaknesses. If you don't like the weapon your using switch to a different one until you find one you love.  The character customization is insane and you can even customizes your cat friend.

PBCO, ^30155809^21^4^"I do not have an Xbox Live account and I refuse to pay the $60/yr fee to have one. I just want to play a game in my home on my Xbox One. This game is ONLINE ONLY! The only option to play offline is to play the co-op with another person and see how many waves of zombies you can survive. No solo play. No campaign."^1^August 5, 2015
BaxterJ, ^30155809^18^11^"I have only had this game for a few days, but still think I'll continue to play it for awhile. The match making now works after a launch day server fix. The controls are very responsive and solid. For $40 on XBone, I think it is a good value, but of course I would like a lower price. Microtransactions are not on yet, but I can guess what they will be. I don't feel once they are turned on this will make it a pay-to-win game. Just invest time instead of money and you can get the same thing.

Something to keep in mind is this game doesn't have the traditional PvZ from the previous games. The closest thing is the Garden Ops mode. You have a garden and waves of zombies will come at you. There are always 10 waves and an 11th when you are to escape. You can play this mode solo, a private match and I've beat it on easy, or with three other players. There 4 of you defend your garden through all the waves.

The other game mode is a more traditional multiplayer. So far there is a Team Deathmatch mode and a Rush mode. These are up to 12v12 and very fun. I hope more modes are released in the future."^4^March 4, 2014

John, ^45630796^3^58^"If you're someone who likes to pay for a game that you can't really play, then this is for you. The game has TONS of glitches. For example, motorcycles don't move. You can hit the gas and the wheels will spin in place. Also, there are missions to steal supply planes for the 'rebels', but you literally cannot complete them because they do not move - just like the motorcycles. And if you think 'well customer service at Ubisoft will fix it' - they won't. I have contacted them several times in regards to these issues and all they say is that their 'dev team' is working on it but they have no estimated time that these issues will actually be fixed. Overall, terrible experience. I wish I had never bought this game and wasted my $60."^1^March 26, 2017

You pick up the remote to catch up on that show you recorded on the DVR to only find out the remote doesn't work. Battery dead? Open up the back....NO BATTERIES! SON! In here, you follow the trail of drained batteries, chip bag, to find your 12 year old playing the Xbox like he had been there for days. I jumped on Walmart.com placed the order for this little jewel. Went down to my local store order that was ready in a few minutes. Picked it up with a pack of batteries and back to the house. The charger is easy to set up, you can easily tell when the controller is charged. The dual allows the little gamer to switch over to the other once one dies. I'm finally back to my remotes working.

Rob, ^52538320^1^0^"So I got this instead of the Microsoft one which was a little bit more expensive and you only get one. I've had it for a total of 29 days and one of them quit charging. The product gets a one-star because of the faulty one. Hopefully the other one holds up longer. I give a big five star to the return policy for Walmart. I thought I was Sol on returning it because it is it going to be a month tomorrow that I purchased it. Because many stores you only have a month or less to return an item. Well not with Walmart they give you a whole 90 days to return an item. Thank you Walmart I will be returning this and getting the Microsoft one as soon as possible!!!"^1^December 19, 2017

Vector, ^50259740^4^4^"Right out of the gate this is NOT a child friendly game! As the M rating states this is a mature game with violent death scenes and imagery that may not be suitable. That said its up to the parent to make the call but from experience I can tell you the animations are very graphic and very detailed. Now, on to the game. Having played the alpha, closed beta, and open beta I can say this for certain. This is an extremely fast paced run and gun first person shooter as one would expect from the older games. Speed can be modified to tailor to every gamers liking but as with most games of this nature the slower and sedentary you are the more you will have to respawn. The single player campaign boasts a huge 12-15 hr average run time. For those that are fans of the genre you know standard single player campaign is average 8-9 hours. For the old school doom players. The multiplayer is more of a quake arena and unreal tournament meets call of duty mashup. It retains the blistering speed of doom but includes the load out system of more modern shooters. So don't expect to be running into a match with your bfg and 20 rounds. As with all doom games minus the addition of doom three this game completely does away with reloading and just gives you a total ammo count which you can replenish ammo by picking up boxes as usual or preforming the new 'glory kills' these are kills in which after you damage the opponent enough they flash. Once you run to the flashing opponent and melee him you are treated to a gory yet satisfying animation that usually depending on what angle you are approaching the enemy winds up with you gaining health, armor, and ammo. As previously stated these are extremely graphic. All in all I love the game and my time with it is amazing and the new snap map editor which allows infinite possibilities for a player to create their own map and upload it is a great touch. Beef up the strength of the enemies and you and four friends can run through the hardest level you can dream up. This for me is what doom 3 should've been."^5^May 12, 2016

Angeldaemon333, ^10986107^7^2^"i recently got this game for free in the mail through the promotion with buying guitar hero 5. as far as gameplay goes it's the same that guitar hero fans have come to love. as far as the game goes as a whole it feels very rushed and incomplete. i'm not sure if it's incomplete but it definitely feels that way because it doesnt have the same overall feel as guitar hero metallica did. it's more like the older aerosmith game. theres no story and mostly when you beat the game it doesnt feel like you've accomplished anything. in order to beat the game you must complete every song on the track listing, which there doesn't seem to be enough of either. there's somewhere around 25 tracks from van halen and a short list of mostly mediocre tracks from opening acts. by far the worst track listing yet for a guitar hero game. personally i think since they set the new standard so high with guitar hero 5 that they fell very short with van halen. they have taken a few steps back instead of following up with the graphics and gameplay features of 5. like i said b4 i dont know if this is basically a beta version they gave out for free and will polish it up b4 release this christmas but if not and this is the final product then i say save your money for another guitar hero title or perhaps one of the rock band games. the only way i can see spending 60$ ont his game is if you are a huge fan of van halen and just have to have it or to complete your collection of guitar hero games like myself (i'm a big fan of guitar hero and have all of them but smash hits). so i hope this ehlps all of you decide whether or not to buy it. personally i'd say borrow it from someone you know that has it already through the promotion or wait till it's rentable b4 purchase. overall i give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5. it's not a bad game it just falls short of the quality we have all come to expect from Guitar hero."^3^October 9, 2009
9999Hitpoints, ^10986107^3^1^"When I pop in a Band-Centric Guitar Hero game, I expect to be treated to a visual and musical time capsule full of all of the band's definitive moments, a decent collection of their songs spanning their career, and a treasure chest of little known facts, rare memorabilia, and well, some evidence that the band itself was involved with the game. After bringing Guitar Hero: Van Halen to a close, I don't see my criteria met. Instead, I ran through my third (fourth if I bought Smash Hits) Guitar Hero game of 2009, and after finishing it, I don't feel like I've learned much about Van Halen itself.

By now, anyone who hasn't played a guitar hero game shouldn't start with Van Halen. If you have this game, you either A) Followed up on the free voucher offer after purchasing Guitar hero 5, B) Are a Van Halen fan, estatic to see them in their own music game, or C) Proving it's possible to play Guitar Hero all year round, since a new game is released by the time you finish the previous one.
If this is your first foray into Guitar Hero, or any music game for that matter, I highly recommend picking up one from the main series in the series first. For the same price as GH: Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5 has 85 songs from a larger variety of artists, while Guitar Hero 4 (World Tour), just a year older, has 86. Since we're dealing with a band-centric game, expect to hear a lot of Van Halen, and not much else.

The same familiar formula of playing is present here, but without getting too technical, Van Halen's game engine is the same as GH Metallica's, making it older than Guitar Hero 5. This is all well and good, but it's an odd choice on Activision's part, because it was released after GH 5. In my opinion, this isn't as much of a setback, because the controls feel a lot tighter under this engine compared to GH 5. The songs are note tracked pretty well. The difficulty curve steadily rises as you make your way through the set list, alternating with a venue for guest artist tracks, and a venue for Van Halen's music. There isn't a point where you'll ace one song and the following song will be so far over your head you won't know where to begin. The slider sections, characterized by transparent notes connected by a clear rope, are still pretty useless, because they are just thrown in randomly, or when you reach a very difficult section where the game expects you to use it, its just easier to flail on the keys.

By now, most of us know what to expect with Guitar Hero, so the only factor that handicaps Van Halen is it's presentation. I'm betting that Van Halen fans will be disappointed once they notice the game completely omits their bassist of 31 years, Michael Anthony, and their second vocalist who fronted the band for 13 years, Sammy Hagar. While Anthony's absence can be overlooked (Metallica featured songs from all three of their Bassists, so it could have been done here too), the decision not to include any work from Hagar effectively cuts off the chance to feature any songs from their albums after their last album with original and current front man, David Lee Roth, 1984. All this cutting, trimming and removing results in a setlist that only features 25 of their songs, with 3 of Eddie's solos. I believe the amount of material they've recorded from 1978 to 1998 should warrant more than 28 tracks. Tacked on are 19 songs from guest bands/artists, some who have a questionable affiliation with VH, coming to a grand total of 47 tracks.

Don't get me wrong, Van Halen's music is decent, and fans of their legacy would quickly find a handful of their favorite tracks here. GH fan's prayers have finally been answered with the long overdue addition of Eddie's famed solo, Eruption. Hang Em High, Panama and Jump are all easily recognizable classics, and are a blast to play. Guest tracks like Deep Purple's Space Truckin' and Queen's I Want It All complement Van Halen perfectly, but oddballs like Stacy's Mom by Fountains of Wayne seem well, out of place.

Once you've played through all of the songs or just your favorites, that's pretty much the end of the game. There's really no further indication of the band's involvement with this game, which is very surprising. There's cheesy footage of the band in awkward mo-cap suits recording their movements on stage(a la Metallica), no rare pictures, band interviews(Aerosmith), or even a hey, thanks for playing our game! message from the band. Beyond playing the songs on our plastic instruments, the only way we know its Van Halen is when the four of them are on the stage.

Guitar Hero: Van Halen is a decent game when not stacked up against it's contemporaries. It continues to feature the great gameplay that Guitar Hero is known for. But since this game focuses on the legacy of a single band, their presentation is just as important as the game itself. Players who know nothing of Van Halen's background will be treated to a history lesson that leaves out a handful of important events and people. In Van Halens case, its inexcusable to not even mention the time and effort Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar put in."^3^January 13, 2010

javawebweaver, ^55855180^3^3^"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This game doesn't even work right when you're playing defense. You're supposed to press and hold the A button to have your nearest defender 'attack' [so to speak] the opposing offensive player with the ball, but instead of making a straight line towards the offensive player with the ball, and ACTUALLY confronting the offensive player, your defender will make a semi-circle to the right or left and come in BEHIND the offensive player, making it totally useless!!! Also, this game has WAY, WAY too much downtime with weekly and monthly 'maintenance periods', each lasting 4 or more hours. If they need this much time to maintain their servers, then they need to invest in buying better servers. [I've played over 200 xbox one games, and NOT ONE of these other games had ANY downtime for scheduled maintenance WHATSOEVER!!!] This game has been out for over 6 months now, and they still haven't nor apparently plan to address this problem even with all the downtime..."^1^February 15, 2018

erod550, ^25394875^16^2^"I'm happy that EA is back in the basketball game, but this was just a terrible effort that failed miserably. It falls short of NBA 2K14 in so many ways. The graphics aren't as good, the ball physics aren't as good, the animations are clunky and not smooth, the ball bouncing off the rim looks worse than basketball games from 10 years ago, players will stop at the invisible out of bounds wall instead of diving for a ball or trying to save it.

It would be 1 star if it wasn't for the positive that we now have some more competition to keep 2K on their toes, but this game really isn't any competition at all. If it was all we had, I'd play it, but being that NBA 2K14 exists, there is no reason whatsoever to buy NBA Live 14."^2^December 3, 2013

The games are fun, but get boring after some time. If you are playing with friends, I assume it stays fun. Playing solo got stale after a half a day.

MaxBlastoff, ^44782727^4^9^"This review is for the XBOX One version of Star Wars Battlefront.

First off, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and have played all of them going back to the first 1980s arcade versions. Now that being said, I can tell you that the game controls are HORRIBLE, the WORST I've ever used in any Star Wars game, especially for the flying vehicles.

You cannot map individual control buttons. The one that bugs me the most is the left or right stick as your only choice your power/speed control button. It would be much better if it could have other button options like being on one of the trigger buttons. Also, the flying vehicles are very mushy and erratic when compared to games like Ace Combat, HAWX, and even the 1983 arcade version of Star Wars. Basically, I find many of the controls for this game somewhat clumsy.

To make matters worse, I bought it at Game Stop and when I tried to return it after 5 days they refused. They only allow used games to be returned within 7 days, so GAME STOP BUYERS BEWARE! If you must have it, wait and get it used from Game Stop so you can return it within 7 days if unhappy, or get it from someone who has a fair return policy. Also there are a lot of video glitches in the cut scenes and in the game play. I'M VERY FREAKING UNHAPPY WITH THIS GAME!"^2^December 18, 2015

MaxBlastoff, ^44782727^2^10^"This review is for the XBOX One version of Star Wars Battlefront.

First off, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and have played all of them going back to the first 1980s arcade versions. Now that being said, I can tell you that the game controls are HORRIBLE, the WORST I've ever used in any Star Wars game, especially for the flying vehicles.

You cannot map individual control buttons. The one that bugs me the most is the left or right stick as your only choice your power/speed control button. It would be much better if it could have other button options like being on one of the trigger buttons. Also, the flying vehicles are very mushy and erratic when compared to games like Ace Combat, HAWX, and even the 1983 arcade version of Star Wars. Basically, I find many of the controls for this game somewhat clumsy.

To make matters worse, I bought it at Game Stop and when I tried to return it after 5 days they refused. They only allow used games to be returned within 7 days, so GAME STOP BUYERS BEWARE! If you must have it, wait and get it used from Game Stop so you can return it within 7 days if unhappy, or get it from someone who has a fair return policy. Also there are a lot of video glitches in the cut scenes and in the game play. I'M VERY FREAKING UNHAPPY WITH THIS GAME!"^2^December 18, 2015

EJay25, ^41159679^4^1^"Gameplay Mechanics: 4/5 (The brutality of this game is very satisfying, as well as the executions, the boss fights on the other hand leave more to be desired; they are quite repetitive actually)

Art Style/Graphics: 5/5 (Truly a next gen title, Ryse showcases the power of this generation of consoles' hardware and has set the standard for visuals of an Xbox game)

Sound/Music: 5/5 (The voice acting is superb, the sound of war is superb, the soundtrack is great and consistently sets the tone for whatever situation you are in)

Multiplayer: 4/5 (It's great fun surviving wave after wave of enemies; even if you have to do it by yourself)

Is it worth the price? Definitely, especially with the included DLC."^5^December 7, 2015

Luke, ^46159883^3^0^"I honestly can't remember the last time a game had the decency of treating me like a capable human being. 

While it teaches you the basics and helpful hints pop up here or there, you're left largely to your own devices on how you wish to accomplish your goals. 

The co-op found in the game is well worth the purchase price alone. 

My only caution is don't expect an action rpg, this is more along the lines of a story driven 'tabletop' rpg and not Fable."^5^September 22, 2016
Brilane, ^46159883^2^4^"I suppose if you're looking for a super slow experience you would like this but we played for over 4 hours and spent about 20 minutes of all that time actually fighting anything. You have to do a ridiculous amount of talking to figure out what to do and even when you know it's hard to find things. There are no way points so you end up wandering in and out of random buildings until you luck across the right one. 

Maybe it's just not my kind of game but I was pretty disappointed."^2^June 27, 2016

JRock, ^47308813^1^0^"As a wrestling fan, I would recommend this to a friend or family member. You can create a superstar, diva, arena, logo, championship, and a show! The my career mode is extended and it feels fresh every time you are on it. The roster is extended as well with over 120+ superstars/divas including NXT superstars. The soundtrack was much improved from last year and if you like a superstar or diva's theme, you can add that to the soundtrack list.

ZeusFonsi, ^30534321^4^0^"The game ticks all the boxes for the usual COD customer. The usual struggle for the multiplayer is the jump to another physics engine and 'rationale' takes a while, and in some cases is discouraging.
So far, it has been good enough, but I would not call it great. I think the MP mode of the previous game was simpler and to a point more enjoyable. This one strongly encourages camping: something most players loathe.

As a side note: Wal-mart is definitely NOT the place to pre-order a game with the expectation that it will show up on time. No matter what shipping option you select, it simply will NOT happen."^4^November 19, 2013

The campaign was interesting, if not pretty easy, even on the most difficult setting. This combo pack is nice as it gives you download choices for both the 360 and Xbox one. Realize, though, both servers are separate, so once you go to the Xbox one, you won't be able to play with your buddies on the 360 unless you have kept your 360 and play the game there as well."^4^December 6, 2013

If you get the right burn card you can hang from the wall for a much longer period and wait for someone to come by. Most of the maps are big and look and play great. The season pass is only $25 dollars. Lots of weapons to choose from for you and your mech. the matches are fast and your mechs are powerful. The connectivity of this game is great I played a lot of games and only experienced lag a few times and I'm playing wireless on my XB1 (Xbox One) and the router is downstairs in my house. If you like shooters you will like this game. One thing I miss is a single player campaign only because I'm used to having one.

Gamer1thousand, ^26531800^0^5^"This next gen game makes it exiting to see whats in store for the forceable future in gaming. I like how one can movouver more fluidly with jet packs and wall running. In the next installments i would like to see an improvement on the moves the players can make as well as the run and gun being on the top of the list. Thanks Wal-Mart.com once again."^3^March 18, 2014
ArizonaRain, ^26531800^0^1^"So I bought this for my husband and although he absolutely loves it, I understand why it was only $25. There is no story mode, or any other mode for that matter, there is only one mode which is only on-line play. According to my husband & son it's much easier then COD because you play against the computer and only a few other gamers which makes it so much easier to get kills. Maybe it's just me...but I don't get the hype about this game but again, the guys love it so I guess that what really matters."^4^December 3, 2014

rje007, ^32984018^22^1^"There are games for kids besides just a bunch of shooting games, and the Lego game is a great example. Yes, there is technically shooting in the game, but it is mild and very cartoon-y, and most of the time you are shooting at Lego robots. Most of the game actually involves problem-solving and even teamwork if your kids are playing together. My kids have had a blast playing this and I've enjoyed playing it with them. Definitely recommended."^5^June 26, 2014
ErinRDH, ^32984018^9^1^"Bought this for my nephew, he was SO happy! He did not think anyone would get it for him because of the price but since Walmart had it for such a great deal online I was able to get it for him. Only wish I could have purchased online and picked up in store. Kind of strange that the store price was SO much higher and they do not match their own online prices. But it made for a second time for my nephew to be excited when the mail man brought it."^5^September 27, 2014

Hank123456789, ^32984018^9^2^"I'll start by saying I'm out of college but don't have kids of my own (not a little kid or parent). This game has had a lot of issues. Levels that get stuck (cant trigger stage advance), characters that get stuck (have to dropout or restart level), and the worst moment was when the game lost all our progress since a level early in the game level.

This really irked me. We had been saving, the save was still there, it just wasn't up to date. My gf and I play this to relax and spend some time together. I had to blast through the levels to get us back to where we were.

Lego usually has a lot high quality easy going gameplay. This one is sometimes infuriating due to glitches. Lego marvel was great on Xbox one, maybe the Hobbit one will resume the quality I've seen in the past."^2^November 9, 2014
NCGal83, ^32984018^6^1^"First let me say that I am an adult and I do not have kids of my own. I have almost all of the Lego games so I bought this one to add to my collection. I was disappointed with this one. I had very high hopes for this game considering it was a Lego Movie made into a game. The levels were very short, everything was easy to play and beat. I beat this game much faster than what I usually do with the other Lego games. I would recommend this game to a smal child who has never played video games before, but anyone with any experience with video games will find this too short."^3^February 19, 2016

The only difference is that this will cost you $50 instead $20 or less.   The graphics, just from the screen shots alone, look standard.  They have little detail and the stones look slightly grainy.    Honestly I'd wait for the price to drop before trying this out.

GeneralProper, ^44910427^13^4^"Madden the Football game everyone loves around the season and holidays. Sure enough the game has improvements and handles great. The game offers many different modes and ultimate team is still great with picking players you may have seen on espn classic or when you were younger. The game would be rated 5 stars if it wasn't for these issues. The commentary has been brutally terrible in recent years and this year is still ongoing. The commentary is boring,flat and doesn't keep up with the pace of the game. With the advanced controls on WR being YAC,Aggressive and Possession gives the WR an advantage if you throw it up to a tall receiver 9/10 they catch it so its kind of over powering and has your wonder He Really Caught That!!!!. All in all great game if you're a seasoned madden player you'll love hate some parts of the game but still good fun with friends and family."^4^November 25, 2015

BygoneSamurai, ^36250981^2^0^"Battelfield 4 on the Xbox One is amazing. If you liked this game on the Xbox 360 and plan on getting an Xbox One, the upgrade is well worth it. You can expand your gameplay from the usual 12V12 to 32V32 in multiplayer or you can just stick with the 12V12. The maps are expanded and you have more room to roam and find better hiding spots for you Snipers. There is more detailed environments, more vehicles per map, and team play is expanded greatly. If you were tired of all the glitches and freezes that use to happen, the new Fall update fixes all of them and improves a lot of things in the game.

So being able to set turrets and what not that operate automatically is pretty boring to me just waiting for them to either finish the job or fail. But this allows you to dive into the action with some third person shooting as well as controlling the turrets yourself, and yes the ones you place and don't control will do the auto attack thing. The game is great and an even better bang for your buck. Great game with plenty of things to do. Easily worth $20.

I steered clear from this game series for a while until the first one became free through games with gold, and gave it a try and instantly loved the game. There are a total of 3 of these games, each of them offer different nostalgic gameplay. Original one, Toy Soldiers. Sequel, Toy Soldier:the Cold War and lastly Toy Soldiers: War Chest all offer very similar gameplay with differences in the character selection and weapon uses."^5^February 4, 2017

The game took some time to set up, then to find out we needed a gold card. That's when it really became difficult. Took 2 days to get it right, making kids so upset and me to the point of throwing xbox out the window. Finally got it, every once in awhile it acts up, frustrating 8 & 9 yr olds.

For a pricetag this cheap (pre-owned), you are going to get more than your money's worth out of it. With a seemingly endless amount of quests and content to complete, you rarely find yourself bored as there is always something to do.

The music list is incredible for all people who listens to different genres and they have wwe superstars music you play for the title screen. But I'm giving it a 4 star because it sometimes crashes or when prepare for a match it stops but that's an update problem and when I went into the store to buy this product I was told by one of the workers that they will be with me after he got done with another customer and I waited 25 minutes and the guy was walking around helping other customers and talking to employees the whole time and walked passed me more that once but I never got his name but then a employee named joe or Joseph had asked me if I needed help and I told him I will like to get the wwe2k17. Within 1 minute he got the game for me and checked me out and made me feel better.

Garrigus01, ^163382052^7^5^"Fun game, but with caveats.  First, look at the box closely because you are buying a cardboard box with a download voucher and some stickers inside of it.  There is no physical disc.  When you look at it on the shelf at Walmart, you can't see the little banner across the bottom that says 'download code inside.'  I knew this was the case, but your average consumer will see a box and think 'disc-based game' while the download-only games are on the little cards.

As for the game itself, there is a reason it is half-price:  It's not a complete game.  It's a 'Preview Edition' meaning it's a work-in-progress that you can play now.  There are only two maps and the game is glitch.

It's a fun game with an interesting take on your standard deathmatch and as long as you understand you are getting a code instead of a disc and that you are basically playing a beta version (pre-release) game and temper your expectations, you will have a good time."^4^January 7, 2018

Todd, ^642826370^1^0^"Please, do not buy this game.

There hasn't been a good baseball game on an XBOX since the 2K series. In fact the last baseball game I bought was 2K 2012. I figured this would be better because the XBOX ONE is an amazing console. 

I'm selling this tomorrow, because of the following.  

The game play on this is akin to Super Nintendo, and I'm deadly serious. You have one static camera view and limited controls. You can't change the location of a pitch. The outer and batter glide around the box or mound when you move them. It is just silly. You press A to hit. You press A to pitch. I mean it's really lame.

 The graphics are worse than XBOX 360. There is no annoncer chatter in the background, the crowds and stadiums lack any detail. 

Maybe kids will enjoy this. Little kids. Like 6 year olds. 

I hate it...I would have rather lit my $30 on Fire."^1^April 14, 2018
MikeT, ^642826370^1^0^"I ignored the poor reviews of RBI Baseball 18 as I hung on to a glimmer of hope that folks were wrong in their harsh comments of the game.  It didn't take me but a couple hours to wish I would have heeded their warnings!

RBI Baseball 18 starts with a cartoonish opening screen of Francisco Lindor and then progresses to a flashing MLB logo at the bottom right hand corner that seems to take 2 to 3 minutes to load.  After that 2 to 3 minutes the game opening screen loads and even after selections it takes another 2 to 3 minutes of loading time and some cheesy music and Atari era sounds before game play actually can begin.  So after 5-10 minutes you are hoping it is worth the wait and let the fun begin.

Before analyzing the game play let's start the complaints with the availability of practice/training or any other form of getting to know the controls like how to pitch, bat, run, or field.  There is about a super short tutorial on pitching, batting, and running but nothing that would provide you skills beyond the very basic.  You have to pay attention to the splash screen (that is different each start up) on how what buttons are for certain actions but nothing that allows you to practice this use.

Once you start play it takes maybe a minute each half inning for loading.  The batter and the pitcher move around like slots on a foosball table and the batter resets to the original position after each pitch.  There are no controls for placement of fielders though it doesn't matter as most the hits are predictable, the weather is non-existent and probably wouldn't effect anything on this very basic game.  The ball in play is like a blip from pong and the players like robots as they chase a circle that increases or decreases with height of the ball.

The calls of balls and strikes are Leisure Suit Larry era and most have took all of 2 minutes to program and oh forget about getting the names of the players mentioned, walks to the mound, or even a simple set of players in the dugout on foul balls or scoring reactions.  If you hit a home run you hardly even see where it landed, distance, or any other stat and just a head reaction from the pitcher with some lame music as you see the player round first and then heading home.

If this review sounds boring then you hit it right on the head.  For 21st century sports gaming RBI Baseball 18 is a laugher!  But what should we expect from MLB with their below average phone apps, team webpages, and product storefront.

I would bypass this game and buy a PS4 so you can play baseball that resembles 21st century sports gaming.  MLB should get out of the IT business and focus on the sport!"^1^April 24, 2018

As for gameplay.. camera was annoying especially when u get into combat situation in smaller corridors, Teammates would often get stuck/lost so they wouldn't help in battles, Tree bushes would constantly block me throughout exploration.

If u want a rpg game where u explore and kill monsters. Play 'witcher 3'. It wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more fulfilling."^1^December 5, 2016

Soccer and bowling are my favorites, Rock Climbing is a pain because I am too tall and the Kinect has issues seeing my feet and arms above my head at the same time, perhaps I can move the Kinect to fix this.

I got this game expecting that it may offer something new but the only thing that it offered is awesome graphics and a good storyline.

You can play with your phone by downloading the Just Dance Controller App or use the Kinect. (If you have an Xbox One S, you will need to purchase an adapter in order to use the Kinect.) The only thing that separates the Standard from the Gold is the fact of the Gold includes a 3-month subscription of Just Dance Unlimited that gives you access to earlier versions of the Just Dance franchise that aren't available on Xbox One. To my knowledge, songs from earlier versions are added monthly. After the 3-month subscription ends, you  will have the option to purchase a 24-hour Pass for $3.99, 1-month Pass for $4.99, 3-month Pass for $9.99, and a 1-year Pass for $29.99."^4^March 20, 2017

Full Name
UbiSoft Username
Approximate Date and Place of Purchase
A transcript of any current or past UbiSoft support tickets regarding the issue
A good contact email address

DOCUMENTATION DOCUMENTATION DOCUMENTATION, because if it isn't written and/or documented it didn't happen.

We need proof of negligence and a wilful intent by UbiSoft to defraud their customers. That, with the amount of people involved is what will give this issue class-action status.

No matter if the lawsuit is successful or not, their brand will have the stain of the incident published throughout the gaming community by every magazine and website out their and subsequently their stock will take a loss. It's a domino effect and the only thing these big companies understand is when money is being taken out of their wallet.

UbiSoft's Response to My Support Ticket Regarding This Issue

Chat Reference Number: 03373578
I purchased Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag on May 29th 2016 from WalMart.

When trying to fast travel to Nassau I became stuck in the Animus loading screen. Now my game will only load the Animus screen and I can do nothing else with it.

I've tried the quitting from the animus screen and then uninstalling and reinstalling Black Flag probably 7 times and it has not worked for me. I've deleted my save file and redownloaded it from the UbiSoft server. I've cleared my game cache. And I've tried using a different brand new copy of the game disc. Nothing has worked, however, and I am still stuck in the Animus loading screen. I have even left the screen sitting for over an hour to see if the game would load, but it did not.

I've looked on approximately 5 different forum posts about this same issue on several different sites and I've even read comments on YouTube videos concerning this issue and everyone is saying the same thing, Nassau doesn't load and UbiSoft won't fix it.

The only thing I haven't tried yet is downloading a copy from the XBox Live Store to see if that would work. That's why I'm writing today, to see if you would be so kind as to provide me with a download code for my game so that I can give that option a try as a last resort.

Thank you.

Emily B: Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Live Support. Please give me a moment to read your question, and I'll be with you shortly.
Emily B: Good afternoon
Me: Good Morning Emily
Emily B: I'm sorry to hear you've been having issues with Nassau. We actually do have some instructions on how to fix that.
Emily B: They're rather long though, so I'll need to email them to you once the chat closes
Emily B: If you still experience issues, you can update your ticket or just hop into chat again 
Me: Okay
Me: Can you email them to me now so I can read over them to see if it's something I haven't already tried?
Emily B: Sure
Me: Thanks
Emily B: I just sent that email out
Me: Thanks

Body of Email Below:

If you are having trouble loading into Nassau during the Sequence 3, Memory 2 story mission, please follow the steps below to resolve the issue:
1. Make sure your console is connected to the internet and you are connected to Xbox Live with an Xbox Gold or Silver account.
2. Insert the game disc and launch the game as you normally would to play it.
3. After the game has been launched, quit the game and eject the disc.
-The icon for the game should still show up in the Recently Played tiles below the large tile on the home screen.
-If the icon does not appear, you may need to launch another App on the Xbox (such as the Xbox store) and then use the home button in the middle of the controller to leave the opened App. Doing this a couple of times should make the Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag icon eventually appear.
4. Scroll down to recently playede and highlight the Black Flag Tile.
5. In the Manage Game screen, select the game icon, press the Menu button again, and select Uninstall.
6. Once the game is uninstalled, press the Xbox Home button in the middle of the controller.
-You should still Black Flag in the Recently Played area, but now dimmed.
7. Highlight Black Flag in recently played and presst menu button. You should then see an option to install the game.
-This will begin downloading the game from Xbox Live. Note: If there is not an install choice in that menu, try launching the game, and one of the options in the dialog that appears may be Install.
8. Once the game is fully installed, put the disc back in the console and launch the game.
You should now be able to continue playing and load into Nassau without issue.

End Email Body.

Me: On step 6
Me: '6. Once the game is uninstalled, press the Xbox Home button in the middle of the controller. -You should still Black Flag in the Recently Played area, but now dimmed.'
Me: This is no longer true as the only item available in the recently played area is the manage game utility
Me: Can you please provide updated instructions?
Emily B: I'll need to look into it since these are the only instructions provided
Me: I'll wait if you would like.
Emily B: I will ask and see if I get a quick enough response
Me: Thank you
Emily B: I apologize for sending the instructions
Emily B: It seems we are now doing replacements for those discs
Me: Is it the 'You send us $20 for shipping and handling' replacements that I've read about online? And even if it isn't why would I need a replacement disc for a game that was bought two weeks ago? Have there been reprints since that timeframe?
Emily B: You wouldn't need to pay the $20 since it is still within the 90-day warranty, if you bought it two weeks ago
Me: I do not have my receipt, will that affect anything?
Emily B: Yes, you'd need the receipt for that
Me: And this is where the train comes off the tracks. I did not keep my receipt because I assumed in good faith that the UbiSoft game that I was purchasing would be free from any manufacturer's defect and, as such, I did not feel it necessary to keep my receipt.
Emily B: I really do apologize, but I cannot change the replacement procedure
Me: Are you telling me that I should have assumed there would be a defect with the game?
Me: And if so, wouldn't that imply that UbiSoft is aware of the problem with these recently printed game discs and therefore would be knowingly and fraudulently selling said discs to the public?
Me: I'm really wanting to clarify this before I go and talk to some attorneys, on behalf of all the defrauded persons whom purchased this UbiSoft game, so that we can understand if this needs to be a class-action matter or not.
Emily B: We are unable assist with legal issues. If you do not have any technical questions, I cannot provide any further assistance. I do apologize for the frustration for the situation
Me: Thank you Emily. My lawyer will be contacting your company shortly.
Emily B: I hope you have a good week."^1^June 13, 2016

TheAssembler, ^24928933^1^1^"The next generation of gaming.....
As someone said in a description of this game. This game is nothing if not less than imaginative.
Opening sequence: You are a pirate on a ship, floating around the ocean, you find yourself on an island and you have to do some hunting to find skins, then some killing and pirate stuff. Then you pilot a boat and fire guns at boats.
Tomb Raider: In one of the first games, you find yourself on an island, you climb all over the place much like this one, you shoot a lot, find artifacts, like this game, kill a lot of people, do missions and shoot at boats, helicopters and other things, including Jeep.

In a word, KNOCKOFF!
The game took its entire premise from an existing title, it is merely a lazy man's way of generating a title when the game could have been so much more. More than anything, all the tech and jumping around from the hub to pirate land makes me sick. Frankly the game is not well rounded or centered and faults when mixing future tech and old style pirate action.
You spend entirely too much time trying to figure out what year it is.
As for the action, if you loved Tomb Raider and not solving complex puzzles that test your mettle then you will absolutely love this game.
I found it pretentious and poorly thought out.

^55488464^8^0^"This is the cheapest I've found a pre-owned copy of the game.  You don't get the Masamune sword unless the person before you didn't redeem it but that's the way with all used games that have bonus dlc. I've heard the sword isn't all that great anyway.

I've never gotten a used game from Wal-Mart before.  The game cd is in excellent shape.  There were no scratches, no smudges. The game works perfectly so far. I've only had it less than a day. The case came wrapped in plastic. There is a sticker letting you know it is pre-owned. Is it that way for all pre-owned games from here? Doubtful as that is the nature of used cds. I will say that this came in better shape than all of the used games I've gotten from GameStop although that could be coincidental.

As for the game, I've been enjoying it a lot even though I haven't been able to play it that much yet.  The music is wonderful as one would expect. I've only played V and VI, and that was back in the day. It's amazing how far the franchise has come.  The game is beautiful. I can't wait to get a chocobo."^5^June 28, 2017
Chaisiri, ^55488464^4^0^"The condition of the game made my sister and I wonder if it was actually 'preown'. The game was in PERFECT condition. Although , it did not come with a code for the Masamune. However, the sword itself isn't all that good and if you really want the sword. As of right now, you can get it for .49 cents at the playstation store. Of course, I came home, and tried the game immediately. I wasn't surprise that It was working perfectly because there was no scratch on the disc at all. Great preown value. Highly recommend this."^5^August 31, 2017

Dano79, ^52504855^7^23^"This game is full of bugs. I've reported every one that I can find to the game vendor @easportsnhl on twitter and they refuse to contact me back, so I am making sure to spread the word and save others from wasting their money on this game. Sure, NHL16 is missing some features, but it is also missing all of the bugs in NHL17. The passing is a joke, totally inaccurate, I pass it to 10 o'clock and it goes into the wall. The backhand shots have more power than a wrist shot on some occasions. I captured a few videos of stick glitches where my stick went through the boards and even through the ice and I was not able to control the puck, while the computer player has no problem. Do not waste your money on this game!! NHL16 should still be available at a good discount also! If you want a first hand look at the stick glitch issues, here is a link to the video I captured. https://youtu.be/jnPvt4P3NO4"^1^September 14, 2016

My roommate came home the other night from night class and thought it was an authentic Bonvie vs. Bertuzzi tussle.

Only thing I wish it would have another controller. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to a friend."^5^November 5, 2016
RedEagleLXIX, ^38662069^55^3^"First and foremost.  This device is being heavily sold and promoted as a 4K UHD Bluray and streaming device (as well as gaming console).
The 4K UHD Bluray playback is crippled on the audio front unless you opt in to an unstable beta of the software that sometimes works.
Amazon Streaming is still not true 4k streaming on the Xbox One S.  

4K UHD Bluray:  Out of the box, the device claims to support Dlby TruHD and DTS:HD MA via internal decoding and then Multichannel PCM.  This is false.  It has been proven that it is impossible to get a True, unaltered HD audio stream out of the Xbox One series of consoles even via PCM.  Further it has been proven that it actively damages HD audio as anything sampled at 96khz or higher is downsampled to 48khz.  This right here is a major failing.  Further the 4K UHD Spec states a player must be able to decode Immersive Audio formats and supply outputs to at least 2 height outputs or supply bitstream support which the Xbox One S is unable to provide out of the box.
Out of the box, the player for 4K UHD Blurays has audio support worse than a normal Bluray player and does not meet the requirements to be 4k UHD Bluray player.  Both mentioned issues can be corrected by downloading the insider preview app, select to opt-in to the Xbox One Console Update Preview which once installed will have the bitstream option that has been missing from the X1 line).  However, this beta software is buggy and slow at times not even playing video that plays when the bitstream option is disabled.
A further issue is that the drive tends to get noisy with 4k and some 3D discs.  Many videos will have stutters during playback, and/or audio dropouts (search AVSForums for the X1S).

Amazon Streaming: Xbox One S will output to the TV at 3840x2160/60p HDR, but the picture quality is very soft compared to the Amazon app doing true 4k streaming on other devices instead appearing to be upscaled 1080p content (further reinforced by the app's own statement it is putting out 1080).
Pressing 'Y' during playback shows the Amazon App states it is showing 'HD 1080p'.
The same videos played via the Amazon App on a Samsung TV and Roku 4 both show marked increases in quality, being extremely sharper visually with a quality level expected from 4k.  The Amazon app on both of these devices displays 'HDR Ultra HD'.

Notice the difference in playback rating: 
X1S: 'HD 1080p' 
TV: 'HDR Ultra HD'

The advantage this device has is of course the price and being gaming console as essentially a freebie."^2^February 26, 2017
JCSeriously, ^38662069^35^10^"Walmart's part of this, the purchase, went perfectly. Microsoft however complicated things a bit. Set up the XBox One S console and it took 15 minutes, no big deal. Once the unit came on, I went through some quick setup, again no big deal. The last step was a system update. An hour later system says I'm ready to play. The problem is there is no media for Gears 4, it needs to be downloaded. Even on my high speed cable Internet 60GB takes a while. I finally went to bed to try again in the morning when the two games I bought with this unit said they required updates as well. At some point the games will be playable and the graphics will be amazing. If you are giving this as a gift, you may want to set it up before hand and get the downloading out of the way, so the gift receiver doesn't have to wait so long after setting up a new system."^4^November 25, 2016

Jojo, ^38662069^1^0^"The game is a download which is fine but isnt clearly stated with the purchase.  Also to play the game (even campaign mode) you have to activate a gold membership.  The game comes with a 14day trial but you have to give it something like 24-48hrs before the system recognizes you have it to actually play the campaign.  Everything else about this is great."^4^December 19, 2016

Aaron, ^137369561^2^0^"Has all of the downloads that were released for the game. Online community is still around and matches are easy to find.  Only complaints are that you die extremely fast in the game, hardly anyone communicates, the partner system isn't the best for respawns (would've preferred an actual squad), some maps are not very fun (Bespin), I always seem to get stuck on the terrain, and it's hard to get the hero/vehicle upgrades. Otherwise the game is great it looks good, loading times are a little long for not having an SSD on-board the Xbox One but it's nothing that really bothers me."^4^November 22, 2017

counselordan, ^56066400^20^4^"This is the best hunting game I have ever played. This game was originally found only on the PC and it has a strong following. It just came out on Xbox and ps4 this year. The single player part of the game is awesome. You have two wide open maps to hunt. You can either follow the story line or do what ever you want.  I only gave it 4 stars because the xbox live online part of the game does not work very well as of now. I'm sure it will be fixed in the near future. The CPU online play is flawless so I'm sure this is a temporary issue...... hopefully!!!! It would have been as easy 5 star game if that was fixed!!!"^4^November 27, 2017

There are a few great surprises as far as the characters.  I won't spoil anything, just saying that this series is fabulous for the uniqueness of character stories.  Gow 4 doesn't disappoint in that respect.  And never disappoints with it's storyline.  Same as other GoW games.  So you're gonna love this one too."^5^December 29, 2016

Truestar, ^5516041^3^0^"This game beats the first Advanced Warfighter by far, the Campaign is short and easy, even on the hardest difficulty setting, but its still a good story and lots of fun.

The music is excellent, unfortunately there's no 'game soundtrack' out. The music really adds to the mood of the current situation you are in.

Xbox Live is fantastic. Excellent game modes, Clan support, many guns, excellent maps, and even one map from the original Ghost Recon: Embassy!

For anyone who loves Military First Person Shooters ,buy this game."^5^July 24, 2007

The main fault of the game is when you change between your gun and your grenades it takes too much time to throw a grenade and then you can't even see the grenade when you throw it.

The controls are horrible and the physics are as well. You try to turn and it either skids until it hits something or does a crazy 90degree turn. I wish it had a mode where you just cruise around but everything is timed. Also they only have ONE song and it gets old real fast.

I bought the Xbox One version of Dragon Age Inquisition Game of the Year edition on Black Friday. When I bought it, I was never asked warranty for the game. Don't have a receipt, nothing to track the purchase. In the month of June, Dragon Age Inquisition GOTY edition has gotten me stuck in the Jaws of Hakkon with failed solutions and troubleshootings. I can't leave the place, can't travel anywhere, and have done every single quest there is in the Jaws of Hakkon. I have nothing else left to do but remove this game from my collection of video games.
