rolltide333, ^52842714^6^0^"Usually, I am skeptical when I hear that everyone else likes a book or movie. I can't help to feel that it's being blown out of proportion and that it just can't be that good. This book is quite the exception.

Narrated by Death, this unique book explores many deep themes including death and dying (no surprise), the power of words, and the beauty of a good friendship. Liesel is a very well developed, three dimensional character, and the supporting characters only add to the amazing story. This book is different from other World-War II era novels, as it takes the view point of a German child. Very little is mentioned about the horrors of the Holocaust, but the book instead focuses on the average German during the war and also brings up several good questions, such as 'Was it right for the Allies to bomb civilians?'

Zusak proves to be a master of symbolism and metaphors - even the cover of the book (falling dominoes) symbolizes something far more treacherous. I've read this book three times, and pick up on something new every time I read it. It is by far the best book I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone.

Please don't skip over this book because it is labeled as 'young adult.' Just because the main character is a young girl doesn't mean only young girls can read this book. I think anyone, any age could enjoy this book; however, I think people over the age of 14 or 15 would get the most out of it.

Can't wait to see the movie!! (comes out in 2010)"^5^March 13, 2009
mojenkins, ^52842714^6^1^"The reason I decided to read the book thief because I saw there was a movie coming out about it. The trailer looked phenomenal and I have always loved books set in World War II. I purchased the book and I loved it! But loving it did not come automatically. It took me a couple of pages to realized who the narration for the tale was done by, but once I realized that the narration is given by death who stays with Leisel to witness her life, my view and expectations changed a bit and helped prepare me for the rest of the tale.

I anticipated it to be much like other tales based in Germany World War II and immediately start into a tale of survival in a war zone. It came to be more of a story of self-discovery for a young Leisel who has been taken from everything she knows to foster parents. The father lovingly teaches her to read, which she had always desired to learn, and through her love of reading she finds strong connections with others and understanding in a world of chaos.

A wonderful tale that through both the journey we take with our main character as well as pure literary genius helps us to fall in love with the written word all over again."^5^December 5, 2013

look123, ^2664290^20^0^"After reading happiness books like 'Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World', I felt like I had a good handle on what science had uncovered about how to live a happy life and have to say that I am MUCH happier for having read them. But, while the field of positive psychology has made some great contributions to my happiness levels, it's books like 'The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment' that come along and let you know there's STILL more you can learn.

A key concept of the book (if I'm explaining it right) is that you will start to experience a certain kind of enlightenment when you learn to leave your analytical mind behind. In other words, instead of 'thinking' try just 'observing your thinking.' And when you do this, you also need to realize that all this 'thinking noise' that goes on in your head all day long is not really who you are- an enlightening concept indeed!

To that end, the book is set up in a question and answer format to help you get to understand these kinds of concepts. While it might seem ridiculous to some, it really isn't. Case in point, we all talk to ourselves or have witnessed others talking to themselves at times (maybe during a sporting event perhaps). If you ask someone who they are talking to, they will usually say 'I'm talking to myself.' And this, by definition, means that there have to be two 'selves', an 'I' talking to 'myself'- and so justifies the idea of two selves (a 'you' and a 'thinking you' in the book).

Well, if these seem to be the kind of concepts you're ready to explore, this is your book. It raises some good questions and certainly brings up one that you can't argue with: all we have is the here and now. As the book so astutely points out, 'Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing ever happened in the future, it will happen in the Now.' And learning to live in the now IS the point of the whole book."^5^January 28, 2009

PTNDSLR, ^392592^18^1^"I won't waste your time with a rundown of what 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' is about. With over 15 million copies sold, and with a very self-explanatory title, I think you all get it. For the rare person who may not know what this book is about, here's a succinct description: in 1930s vernacular prose, Dale Carnegie explains that by appealing to the other person's highest ideals, remembering the other person's name, letting the other person do most of the talking, speaking in terms of the other person's interests, allowing the other to save face, by 'throwing down a challenge,' etc., you can make a friend out of just about anyone.

The advice is largely sound, but I think the reader should keep in mind the context within which this book was written. 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' was written in the 1930's and intended primarily as a companion book to Dale Carnegie's classes on how to be a good salesman. In other words, these techniques work very well in the context of sales and public relations, i.e., in relationships that are not expected to be deep and/or long-lasting. I wouldn't recommend using these techniques on close personal friends. Doing so may make a person come across as a bit 'plastic.'

Also, there is one major point that I think needs to be remembered, but unfortunately is nowhere to be found in 'How to Win Friends and Influence People.' During my research of Dale Carnegie's techniques, I came across what I believe may be the only biography available about him: Dale Carnegie: The Man Who Influenced Millions by Giles Kemp and Edward Claflin. This book reveals many interesting things, such as the fact that Dale Carnegie grew up poor; he lost part of his left index finger when he was a child; he often broke many of the tenets set forth in this book, often forgetting others' names, often arguing with others, etc. But what I found most interesting was that the last chapter of 'How to Win Friends' was to describe those individuals with whom none of Dale Carnegie's techniques work. In this unpublished chapter, Carnegie wrote that there were some people with whom it was impossible to get along. You either needed to divorce such people, 'knock them down,' or sue them in court.

Why is that chapter absent from this book, you ask? Well, Dale Carnegie was in the middle of writing this chapter when he was offered a trip to Europe, and rather than complete this last chapter he decided to take the trip. The uncompleted book was sent off to publishers, and Carnegie shipped off to Europe.

Giles Kemp and Edward Claflin say that given the optimistic tone of the rest of 'How to Win Friends,' the European trip was perhaps the better choice. Reconciling the the unwritten chapter with the rest of this optimistic book would've been nearly impossible, they say.

Anyway, I think that this unpublished chapter is important to keep in mind. I had to learn the hard way that the unpublished chapter is very true. There are some people with whom it is impossible to get along. When you meet up with such people, and believe me you will, don't think that you've failed the Carnegie techniques. Instead, remind yourself that you are experiencing exactly what Carnegie describes in that pragmatic, unpublished chapter. And then quickly move on to the nicer people!"^5^September 11, 2010
torridtemptations, ^392592^8^0^"Since reading this book, I feel like for the first time I have been given the basic instructions to approach obstacles in a positive way with a degree of confidence in a positive outcome. We have a child with Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and we have been in therapy for 8 years with multiple counselors and psychologists with little to no improvement. She is frequently against anything and everything that we try to teach her or help her with and has no reaction to any type of discipline. In her mind she is always right, always has all the answers and when something goes wrong she is always the faultless victim. I have frequently felt completely hopeless and overwhelmed, and I have thrown up my hands and said that I have run out of ideas and answers about what we could do to help her. Now that I have read this book I have had floods of ideas in how I could approach day-to-day issues without getting as upset or trying to correct her behavior, and I have found many faults in my previous methods which obviously were not working. I have just finished this book so I can't say that we have worked any miracles but I began applying these simple principles while still reading the book and we are already experiencing more pleasant behaviors and finding more enjoyment in our time together. I have already recommended this book to several friends and family members and I'm hoping that they read it and can benefit from it as I feel I have!"^5^May 14, 2012

motivatror90, ^392592^1^0^"A classic (originally published in the 30's) and a must-have, this timeless piece of work can help just about anybody get along better with others and win them over to their way of thinking. Don't have a lot of time to spare? Don't worry. The book is divided into short sections, each one devoted to a particular principle that is well illustrated with many practical examples. In this way, you can read a chapter quickly, stop and do other things you have to do if necessary, and get back to the book when you have time- all without losing continuity.

Thoroughly entertaining by using fun and interesting examples, I don't think many readers will regret checking this one out and I like to think of this book as a kind of Human Relations 101 of sorts. Also recommend 'The Sixty-Second Motivator' for further reading on motivational principles."^5^February 18, 2009

The flaps keep it interesting, though I find some of them odd as in 'why did they make that a flap??'"^5^August 24, 2016

Jack Will is really nice to August so is Summer and they don't care about how August looks. I think this is a really good book and I think the author should make a movie based on the book. I have always tried to imagine August and Summer and everyone else in my mind. But I really want to see August's face. i always try to picture it as hard as I can. Once again this is a really good book and i think the author should make more books. :) :)"^5^December 6, 2013

nrann, ^16658937^1^2^"The book Wonder is a touching story from the author R.J. Palacio.  Wonder is a major motion picture that is about a boy with facial deformities and the struggles he faces.  I thought that it was a great book showing that you should never judge somebody by how they look.
	In the book, August Pullman, Jack Will, Summer and Julian are  the main characters. Their school, Beecher Prep, is the main setting for the story.  The main conflict is among the characters who want to be August’s friend and those who always want to make fun of him.  The conflict is finally resolved when the fifth grade class goes to an overnight camp.  At the camp August and Jack are being bullied.  Classmates join together to help fight the bullies.  At this point all of the other students realize that Auggie is a normal boy and want to be his friend.
	The protagonist is Jack Will.  In the beginning of the book he is August’s friend because the principal firsts introduces the two boys and asks Jack to be friends with August.  Then on Halloween, August walks into class to overhear Jack talking badly about August with some other boys.  This upsets August and he doesn’t want Jack to be his friend.  Once Jack realizes why Auggie is mad at him he apologizes and they become friends again.  Jack is an important character because he is the one friend who is always there for Auggie.  
	I really enjoyed this book because of its message and how it makes everyone aware that we shouldn’t judge people by their looks.  I didn’t enjoy reading the part when the kids were making fun of Auggie and acting like he had a disease.  I felt sorry for him during this part.  This book is unique because it sends a heartfelt message to kids about being kind to others.  The author could have written more about what August did after school ended.  I was enjoying the book and didn’t want it to end.  I would definitely recommend this story to others because of the awesome message it conveys about being kind to others.  Everyone should read this book!"^5^January 26, 2018

Buy this book for your child and take it to the teachers they've had. Let each teacher write a note in it for them. My son is in 3rd grade and my twin daughters are in 1st grade. I purchased three copies of this book and will be having every teacher sign it at the end of the year. I will give it to each child at their graduation party. Can you imagine receiving such a gift?

I looked for this book online and found that a lot of the used books have descriptions that read 'writing on the first page', 'inscription on first page', etc...this seemed to me to be a testament of this book that people enjoy it so much and find it worthwhile enough to gift it over and over again throughout the years.
I am purchasing this book for my little sister for her high school graduation and I hope that she will enjoy it as much as I have.

While this story was written in the 1950s, the relevance of its message is just as sobering, just as powerful, in 2013 as it was six decades ago.

I am saving my copy for my grandchildren, but at this price I will be able to buy copies for several new parents at my workplace. I am disturbed, though, by the fact that apparently there is a video now. That just seems so wrong to me. The point of the book is quality time at bedtime!

I preordered this cookbook from Walmart. I am not sure that it is that much of an improvement over the prior edition, although I have not seen it.

I do know that I have had to go on the internet to find recipes for boiled eggs, etc., simple things that should have been in the cookbook.

It's okay. I'm sure I will eventually try some of the recipes, but I wish it had some of the standard stove top pressure cooker recipes and adapted them for the electric pot.

MrGinger, ^438978^5^0^"If you have not read 1984 but have read other dystopian novels like Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, Anthem, Erewhon, or even the Hunger Games trilogy or V For Vendetta, but want more of this genre, 1984 is a must!"^5^May 19, 2014
Rilay, ^438978^4^2^"This book won’t control your mind, but it does have a lot to do with mind control. 1984 is a book written by George Orwell in 1949 depicting what Orwell believed that England would look like in the future. This book depicts a “Utopian” society that is ruled with an iron fist by the government who uses propaganda to control the population. Propaganda like “Big Brother is watching” is displayed on signs so that citizens know that the government is always watching and that the Thought Police are monitoring thoughts through “Tele-screens” (televisions). These Thought Police are used to track rebels who want to destroy the totalitarian government and bring freedom to the people.

The main character, Winston Smith, works for the government but sees the injustices going on around him. Winston breaks little rules here and there like writing a journal even though this is forbidden by the Thought Police. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth; a government building that changes history by “erasing” events from the past by changing photos, editing books, and completely removing people from history. The Ministry of Truth does this to control the knowledge of past successful rebel uprisings.

This is a great book that gives a lot of insight on what life is like in our society, even if we don’t recognize it on a daily basis. Orwell wasn't completely right with the date, however, I feel that our society is slowly reaching the point in which this book will no longer be “Fiction”. I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a story with a deep history and speculation. I had a great time reading this and i think you will too."^4^December 14, 2014

Fyxation, ^20664829^48^9^"You can't beat the price on this package. If you've been thinking about it, now's the time to buy. This series appeals to more than just fantasy lovers. It lures you in with humanity, political intrigue, massive piles of character development, heartbreak, triumphs, and dragons.

I'd been urged to read the books because I'd 'Like them if I tried them.' After the first episode of the show aired, I borrowed them immediately and plowed through every book that was available. Now that Dance with Dragons is in paperback, I decided to buy this pack to hold me over until the next book.

If you consider yourself a casual reader, don't be daunted by these thousand-page monsters. You'll eat them up and be hungry for more before you know it. And since they're in paperback, you can tote them around with you and plunge your nose into them whenever you get the chance. Difficult to do that with the massive hardback editions.

Again, I can't stress how great this price is. The individual MSRP for these is $9.99 each.

If you have any interest in the TV show or are just looking for something new to read, this is definitely something you want to add to your cart."^5^March 21, 2014

Daniel95, ^20664829^11^3^"This book is great in everway it has a compelling story that makes you not want to put the book down.The chapters are not so long but they are not to short they range from 10 pages to 22 pages a chapter.All the characters are great they are not flat meaning they have alot more to them as you read and they all have something that makes each character unique.The only problem I have with the way it is written is that there is no index meaning there is no chapter list and the chapters are named by the characters names instead of the traditional chapter 1 or chapter 2.The biggest problem is that some letters will be missing but it is usually the last letter of the word and there are tiny ink blotches on alot of pages, on words and on the sides of the pages.But for 26 dollars online that is still a great price and the quality of it is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.If you decide to buy it in the store it cost me 36 dollars which is a little more than if you buy it online,hope this helps.This book is phenomenal and is my favorite book."^4^March 13, 2014

RickMeister, ^4406976^2^0^"My fourth grader has read over 200 pages of this book during the last couple weeks. Although he prefers the 39 Clues serious for more action, I find this book a more valuable reading accomplishment.
The exposure to mythology will help to pronounce the names. But, more importantly, if you are on the AR system for reading, this book is worth 13 points. Riordan's 39 Clue book was worth several points and is what helped to choose our current title. Having seen the recent flim also helped to make the title a good current choice.
I have chose this book to let the youngster realize that even a thick book can be overcome.

He's really enjoying the book and identifies the differences between the written title and the film. The chapters about the St. Louis Arch have sparked new interest and we hope to have the last half completed in the next couple weeks.

I would not advise this title for a student who has not accumulated enough reading points to go without testing during the amount of time required to complete this title. If you're reading with your child, you'll know if this is a title for your child.

But, this is the best price I've found for new product. Scholastic also has rereleased this title with a more flashy cover. Following along with my son I can assure you each cover contains the same story word for word. Save the six bucks and buy this version.

Also consider the boxed set for more reading at better savings."^5^March 14, 2011

I just bought the paperback for my 15 year old granddaughter, hoping she will love it just as much. In my opinion, SK never again wrote anything as perfect. I wish they could find a way to being it to the screen and do it justice, the Rob Lowe movie wasn't it. I think it should be an HBO series. That would be something to see!"^5^December 21, 2013

NachoMan, ^734355006^36^0^"Powerful, powerful book. I haven't come across a better book for a young or older mom to read. My wife handed me this book to read after reading it herself (and wiping away her tears). As you read this story, you quickly see where it's going, but that doesn't diminish the impact of the final pages. As much as I tried to remain stoic and composed (my wife was right there watching!), my face flushed, a lump formed in my stomach and throat, my eyes welled up with tears and (by the end) a few tears dripped off my nose. Perhaps I'm a softy, but this book really has an impact. As much as I love my two sons and can't imagine anyone loving them more, this book opened my eyes to how special and unique the love between mother and son is."^5^January 11, 2010
Babystonecold, ^734355006^28^3^"I read this book to my son when he was a baby at least once a week. I read to him every night and he had a lot of books for me to choose from, but I kept going back to this one. As he got older, he started singing the little verse with me, only saying 'my mommy you'll be'. I thought it was so sweet! He's 12 yrs old now and from time to time (mainly when he's sick or has a lot on his mind), I'll get this book out and read it to him. That may sound corny, but it kind of fits the book! We will love this book forever!!!

Raleighmomof1, ^734355006^9^3^"I ordered this book for my son's 1st birthday. I've read it to him a few times, but he doesn't quite have the attention span for this 28 page book. I look forward to reading it to him when he is a little older. I really like the story--demonstrates how a Mother will always love her baby no matter how old he gets. My husband, on the other hand does not like the book. My husband called the mom in the book a 'stalker mom'--when the son is grown and moved away, his mother drives across town, opens the window, and holds her son (rocking and singing to him). I gave only 4 stars since my husband dislikes the book. I'm keeping this book because I like that it portrays a deep & special bond between a mom and her son. I'm sure my son will like it when he is older."^4^October 1, 2011

b1mom, ^734355006^8^2^"This is one of the cutest, most heartwarming books I have ever read. I bought it for my son (age 33 :) because the picture on the front looks exactly like a memory we had when he was almost 2 years old. My son, 'then,' escaped my watch for a few minutes when he made believe that he was going to potty. Little did I know that he was in some mischief with the toilet paper & an entire tube of toothpaste!( a HUGE tube!) When I went to check on the 'potty status,' I opened the bathroom door expecting to, of course, see him sitting calmly on the potty chair. Then suddenly I gasped at the sight before my eyes! My usually 'trouble-free' little boy was covered in toothpaste, the toilet paper roll was UNrolled all over the bathroom. There was toothpaste & toilet paper on the toilet seat, the sink, the floor, the door, the mirror & all over the shower floor! Needless to say, I'm sure that my son expected to get in trouble for this, but all I could do was laugh!

So, now you see why I just HAD to buy this book. Like I said, I got it for my son. (actually for Mother's Day gift-because I wouldn't be a Mom if I didn't have him as a son!) But I had to read it before I sent it to him. This book is absolutely priceless with the message it sends to children ( & adults,) about the love of a mother. And what an ending! You just have to get this book! The only thing I would change is . . .the age level! I think it should read 'for ages 3 to 103!"^5^May 18, 2010

SweetViolin, ^734355006^1^0^"This is the story of a mother who takes care of her little boy from diapers to the teenage years and all the way through adulthood. As the mother ages and becomes more dependent, it tells the story of how the son gives back and takes care of his mother in her old age. It's very touching; a great 'circle of life' story and one that illustrates the love between a parent and child. This book is great for girls too but because it's the story of the special relationship between mothers and sons, I love giving this book to new mothers of baby boys or mothers of toddler boys. It makes me tear-up every time. When my kids were little, it was always the story they wanted me to read. I made up a little tune to go with the song so you can make it unique to your family. I just bought 5 copies to have on hand for gifts."^5^November 26, 2012

Andishop, ^145803129^6^2^"This book is highly recommended from my 11 yr. old. My son doesn't really like to read but said everyone should read. This book was on his school summer reading list originally he wasn't real happy that I ordered this book. He normally drags out his reading to the last minute but once he started reading he didn't really want to put this book down. Finished this book in about 5 days which was Great!! I didn't have to constantly remind him to read either. He now has talked almost everyone in the family into reading this book including his grandparents. When he finished the book he also said 'mom I shouldn't have judged a book by it's cover' :-).
The best part for me was not having to shop for it all over town, the quickness in ordering and receiving at my door the day the email showed we would receive (sooner then showed on the original order too). All the libraries had a waiting list so long that we would have never been able to check it out and not to mention the gas money I saved from not driving to every store in town."^5^August 10, 2009

I lost weight AND inches. My diabetic reading went from 172 to 94. My good cholesterol has greatly improved and I feel GOOD about myself! My doctor was impressed and when I went to get my mammogram done the doctor and the technician both decided they were going to start the cleanse the following Monday!

Girls, after I lost my first 14 pounds, my husband said he would try that 'green stuff' and after his 5th day and minus 7 pounds he said the green stuff wasn't so bad after all.

I battled with my weight for years never understanding that my weight issues had a lot to do with me being an emotional eater. Although this book is small it's packed with tons of knowledge that will get you through the 10 day's and also the rest of your life. When I first bought this book, I thought there is no way that I would be able to do it but it hasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be. This book is not just about Green Smoothies but it gives you all the tools you need to take care of your mind, body and soul. This is not a diet program or some juicing quick fix but it's a lifestyle change. My PCP has been overly pleased with my results and even more so my lab results."^5^October 5, 2014
JJinTexas, ^38310494^315^53^"My daughter bought this book for me and my best friend. We both agree this is the best gift we have ever gotten. Please do not be discouraged by the word cleanse. This book is so much more. I promise you will have a total different relationship with food. More than anything you will feel so good, mind, body and in so many more ways I cannot express enough. I too experienced outstanding lab results from my doctor. I was diabetic and now I am not. It is not a diet! It is life changing way to look at food. Also I am never hungry and always satisfied. Imagine that on a cleanse. If you are even on the fence about getting this book and trying green smoothies, please do not wait any longer. I promise you, you can only benefit from this lifestyle."^5^April 25, 2015
Happy, ^38310494^142^18^"This an excellent book to read when you want to loose weight. I have been on this diet for one week and I have now lost 13 lbs. Someone recommended this book to me but I wish they would have done it sooner. This book will help anyone to loose weight. It is very easy to follow the simple steps. Try it now and don't wait any longer."^5^March 14, 2016
Duck60, ^38310494^128^48^"While I was waiting for my book to come from Walmart, I checked the same book out at the library. I still wanted my own so I could make notes in it.  So while I was waiting for my book to come, I started the cleanse.  I am on day 9. I have dropped 15 lbs.  I had my nails painted w/the gel stuff in April of 2013 for my cousins wedding. When they took the gel polish off my nails one of them had split. It has been split from April 2013 to now, July 2016. That's 3 yrs. On day 9 it does not bother me at all. It has finally mended! I have had to keep it filed down to the quick. I had to keep a nail file with me everywhere I went, cause I didn't know when it was going snag something. I didn't realize the greens had so much protein in them. It also made me realize how much mindless eating I have been doing.  You'll see. It works. Just make up your mind and do it. Have 1 more day. But I know I CAN'T start eating any kind of way or I will gain it back. I have way more to lose. This has been a great start."^5^July 16, 2016

Let's talk again when I'm on day 7...."^5^May 25, 2016
purplecrab, ^38310494^78^20^"I bought this book mainly for the cleanse and not really for weight loss.  The book is easy to read and the plan is simple to follow.  I like that it includes a shopping list for the items you will need for the ten days.  Although, the amounts listed to purchase was a little off; I ended up with a surplus of items.  Not a big deal since I'm sure I'll be able to use it up.  I managed to lose 9 pounds after finishing the cleanse.  I had more energy and no longer felt sluggish.  I also was able to sleep much better.  I would recommend this plan for anyone who is looking for an easy detox."^4^May 29, 2016
Calandra83, ^38310494^68^21^"This is a great cleanse. I wasn't mentally prepared when I started so I only made it to day 5, BUT I did lose 8 lbs in those 5 days. I will try again and hope to be more successful at completing the 10 days."^5^March 23, 2016
Gina, ^38310494^65^20^"This is not my first time doing this cleanse, but it is my first time using my own copy of the book! I'm only on day 5, and it's HARD to stick to, but it's a great resource for kick starting weight loss and a healthy lifestyle!"^4^March 26, 2016

AlwaysShopping10, ^518704^7^4^"Another classic written by John Steinbeck is Of Mice and Men, it's one of those of books that you can't put down once you begin to read it. This tale of two laborers: Lennie, a man large in physical stature with a child like mind and George, who's quick and small and the 'brains of the duo', the men work in vegetable fields to support themselves with the goal being that they can earn enough to allow them to live 'off the fat of the land'. George more or less plays protector to Lennie to ensure that they both stay out of trouble and that they do not ruin their chances of getting some land of their own. Without giving the story away, this will prove to be easier said than done."^5^April 22, 2012

A hardcover book would have a hard cover and paper pages, specifically what I was looking for since I was planning to use it as a guestbook for people to sign in at a baby shower.

My son says, 'The book is hilarious. I read it from to start to finish. Believe me it's hard to get me to do that. As for the characters, the parents and adults were insane and the kids were either selfish, stupid or very young. In other words they were all nuts.'"^5^September 21, 2009

mybarman, ^5299928^23^87^"I know this book is popular, but that is unfortunate. I wrote to my son's' elementary school principal that I had reviewed this book, brought home from the school library. The principal agreed that the book has no redeeming quality, except it gets kids to read.

How sad that books are now promoted based on childrens discernments, rather than adults.

The problem is that the book depicts the middle school experience as one of mean kids, bad irrelevant teachers, negative references to police and authority...the list goes on and on.

Suffice to say, that it probably isn't a good idean to paint school and the many relationships inherent to school are negative and unreal. Not the message I want pounded into my child.

There are great biographies, and entertianing yet educational books too many to count, why dumb down kids?"^1^December 27, 2008

Peep, ^5950492^1^4^"I picked up this book with the full knowledge that I have a 'fixed' mindset (I'm driven by achievement, rewards, and external praise) and wanting to get some insight on how to change that. This book gives endless examples of the 'fixed' mindset and how that lead the person or organization to failure (some of the examples are actually quite successful), and endless examples of the 'growth' mindset, and how having that particular mindset lead the person or organization to greater success.

Great! I'm on board with this whole 'mindset' modality. Let's get started and do the hard work to fix that! Unfortunately this book does not give you anything except for page after page after page of anecdotes. Seriously. That's it. So, I gather from other reviewers on other websites that by reading the anecdotes you will change? Not sure how that's supposed to work, but ok.

The book has a lot of images and suggests that kids sit on the potty a really long time before they go potty. I do not know if that is the case. My son is already naked (for bath) and sits on his own immediately and goes. I think he is just excited to take the potty and flush it down the toilet. He goes several times ( a little bit each time) just so he can flush it.

The book has a boy sit and sit and sit (with no words just yawning). It also shows what a cat does and what a dog does, but we do not have dogs and cats at home.

I don't know. I would recommend something else."^2^October 21, 2015

WillSant04, ^35394798^4^0^"In The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, he builds a story out of darkness and despair. He takes the tragedy of cancer and immerses us in the lives of characters that could very well be real. Many know of the heartaches in dealing with those who fight the fight, and many of those scars last a lifetime. He brings his story in the form of a teen girl, Hazel Lancaster. Stricken with cancer from a young age, she believes she has come to terms with what her life has become. Then she meets a young man, Augustus Waters, a survivor of cancer. He is drawn to her in a way that is initially uncomfortable, and as she tries to push him away in her sarcastic vein, he finds her to be exactly the type of girl he has been looking for. For cancer touches not just the victim but all those who have loved and are in anyway touched by them. One should be prepared for a story of romance, anger, excitement and humor, and friendship and bravery for that is the way we are led as Green develops the personality of a group of teens that have the courage to bring both laughter and tears. Hidden within that strength they also hide the depression and hopelessness as they try hard to protect their family and friends by showing only the smiles and strength whenever possible. The friendships as well as the depths the families go through preparing for the worst while holding out hope is like a beacon of light.
The courage and humor, the energy and sadness all keep you on a roller coaster of emotion. Green takes you on a journey both terrible and beautiful."^4^October 28, 2014

erinmm, ^35394798^1^53^"I went into this thinking it was going to be clean, written by a Christian and all. I was mistaken and that's all good, we all have different views about what a sin is and all of that. So, that was surprising to me, but the way the book was written...It was horrible. The characters weren't very believable, their conversations didn't make sense a lot of the time. I have a good friend who had Cystic Fibrosis and at this moment is dying. In ICU, barely hanging on. So that the girl complained about not remembering what it felt like to have working lungs really upset me. She did at one point have healthy lungs. I suppose if you don't know someone who has been worse off than the characters or you like books simply because the majority of people are amazed by them (50 Shades, Twilight...) then you might like this one too."^1^February 14, 2014

GentleYuki, ^667070^1^0^"Personally, I love this book. I first read it back in middle school when we had to read books as part of our grade. We were tested on them.

I read the books twice in those four years.

In high school I read the books again, each before the release of the newest installment.

Now that I'm no longer in school and I read on my own time, I wanted to start reading again.

This book is a book that you will go to over and over again. The characters are very real and the plot is amazing.

I'd suggest it for any fantasy/fiction fan."^5^March 19, 2008

It's captivating and takes to you to another place while keeping you in today. I highly recommend to any and all who enjoy fantasy/magical reading. Just the fact the main characters named were touched on in Harry Potters first book with Dumbledore is what caught my attention. I kept half expecting 'Nick' to refer to him at any time. Mr. Scott does an excellent job of describing and helping you picture the scenes and worlds you enter. Enjoy the read, the Magician is just as good and I look forward to more..."^5^November 29, 2008

Our culture, though, tells us to accumulate more and more stuff and using money we don't have is ok as long as you're keeping up appearances. How misguided! Dave calls us to live now like no one else so that later we can live like no one else. His methods require discipline.

Annika4, ^2382721^1^0^"I remember having to read this for high school English 25 years ago, O_o this book (and Animal Farm, which was creepy) is the only thing I remember from high school (which I hated and I hated English even more). This book is the only required book I ever liked. I couldn't put it down and when finishing it left me wanting for more. I recommend this book to anyone who loves either History or war-themed books, which most often are boys. I am one of the few rare females that liked this (History & military/war related themes) book, probably because of being raised in the military and being a tomboy. From what I remember, it was about the conflict between personal guilt, societal pressure, and the instinct of self-preservation during wartime, and how some college boys dealt with all of that in light of that as college students they were exempted (were only going to be called for duty as a last resort) from (the military) going to war. Although they were exempted, they did feel the pressure to serve. I'm not sure how today's youth can relate to this, as I believe they wouldn't have such a dilemma (feel no guilt/pressure) seeing how selfish and self-centered society has become. Those with such personalities would probably dislike and not understand this book nor it's characters."^5^November 5, 2014

It is something to make a person really stop and think about the possibilities and emotions of animals....a movie like this if shown in schools etc could possibly really help stop a lot of animal abuse.  I first only rented this movie from red box.....but I became so emotional while watching it and at the same time so sad....that I had to buy it so I could share it with everyone I know!  Now I did order online and happily it was available to be picked up the next day....go Walmart!"^5^June 6, 2017

Iapprove, ^4214874^10^0^"Love how this Bible talks about Jesus, and how he relates to the story, starting in Genesis and throughout! The Bible is told like a story, so it is easy for a child to understand. Great illustrations too!!"^5^September 28, 2011
HappySeattleGrandma, ^4214874^9^0^"I bought a copy of this 2 years old for my then 4 year old grandson in California and he loved it. When he came up to Seattle last summer, he brought it with him and continually wanted to hear the stories -- even my 10 yr. old granddaughter loved them -- so I bought 4 more to give to two other grandsons and to a neighbor. The stories are interesting -- true -- and exciting for everyone. I now have one in my home and my grandchildren call and I read to them (or have them read out of it). It's a great opportunity to be closer to them and to share Jesus with them. My grandchildren have memorized John 3:16 and we say it together after reading each story. This is a great book at any price but Walmart was quite a deal!"^5^October 15, 2010
Superdave7, ^4214874^6^0^"My 5 1/2 year old loves her new Bible. We read her a story each night. She is entertained by the pretty pictures and the way the stories are told. In my opinion, it is very much a 'read to me' Bible, as you wouldn't really be able to follow along at church. I struggled before to get into a good habit of reading the Bible to her at night, and trying to find a good story to read. No more!!! If you're researching, just get it!"^5^June 24, 2008
LoveBeingWifeAndMommy, ^4214874^4^0^"The Jesus Storybook Bible is a wonderful book! My daughter has loved it since she turned 2. It is great for bedtime, or any snuggle time. It is her favorite book. Most kid's Bible storybooks have the standard key stories, but don't tie them together like this one does. Sally Lloyd-Jones explains how each story relates to THE pivotal story of the Bible, Jesus. Adults can also learn, get new perspectives, and enjoy as they read it, which is VERY important if you're going to read it over, and Over, and OVER!

I DO understand why an earlier reviewer was concerned with the content for young children. Personally, I think the Jesus Storybook Bible is an excellent tool to teach my daughter about 'death, evil, killing, etc.,' since it is balanced with perfection, love, and forgiveness. As with any book read to a child, you may occasionally decide to omit a word, sentence or even a story until they are older. A lot depends on the individual child and parenting style. But, I can't recommend it highly enough!"^5^May 17, 2010
Shirls431, ^4214874^3^0^"I was given this to read by my Pastor for general understanding for myself. After returning it, I just had to buy it for my daughter. It puts the Bible is easy to understand terms and shows pictures to help. I would definately reccomend this for everyone."^5^May 3, 2011
KhunKraam, ^4214874^3^0^"Besides the brilliant colorful illustrations and engaging story telling, the Jesus Storybook Bible is fantastic because each story points children to Christ as the center of Scripture. Many kids Bible story books end up being moralistic, mining the Bible for stories to make children behave better. But the focus of this kids bible is to point them to put their faith in Christ who is the rescuer from sin, sadness, and death. The JSBB is unique among kids Bibles and stands head and shoulders above the rest."^5^December 8, 2010
GeGeAnn, ^4214874^3^0^"As a former pastor's wife, mother and grandmother, with a BA in Bible, I heartily recommend this book for children of all ages. As I read it to my granddaughters, I probably receive the greatest blessing. Through every story told (in both Old Testament and New), it speaks to the heart, revealing God's great love for us in sending His own Son Jesus Christ to be our Savior."^5^September 23, 2013

Felinofile, ^4214874^1^0^"I stumbled on this when looking on Google for pix of creation, and the story of creation accompanying the pix made me run out and buy the book! It is SO great. I read the creation story to our kids during our church's Kids' Story Time, and they LOVED it. It's written with lines the kids can repeat over and over as you read it--perfect to keep kids WITH you. And the end of the book is, again, fantastic. (I'll have to be honest: I myself have read the book through and gotten a blessing!)"^5^April 30, 2010
aMom, ^4214874^1^0^"This book is so cool, because unlike a lot of kids Bibles, this tells Old Testament stories AS THEY RELATE to Jesus, not just in a 'fairytale' kind of format, so they are very relatable and it makes the Bible come alive and real to little kids!  Each Old Testament reference ends by specifically tying it back into the life of Jesus, and how it reflects Him, or how it relates to us through Him, etc.  

For instance, this morning I read the story of Joseph to my daughter.  At the end, it says something to the effect of one day, God would send another young Prince.  Like Joseph, he would have to leave His home and His Father.  His brothers would hate him and want him dead.  He would be sold for pieces of silver, and punished even though he did nothing wrong.  But God would use everything that happened to Him, even the bad things, to do something good - forgive the sins of the whole world'. (Paraphrased of course.)  Honestly it's even inspired me as an adult, reading it!"^5^March 16, 2017
bookbuyer01, ^4214874^1^16^"I bought this book based on a review I read stating that it was the perfect beginner bible for small children.

Her writing style is conversational despite the fact that she is an expert in her field and has a PhD. This book made me want to love myself and people more unconditionally.

LanguageLover, ^38181065^14^6^"I can only assume that this book has a 5star rating because the reviewers had not read any other book on the topic, or because they were going along with the recent fad-aspect of this book. The best book on this topic I have ever read is 'Unstuff Your Life' by Andrew J. Mellen. It covers the subject in much more detail, and is more tailored to American readers. It is available from Walmart, too. It doesn't have as many reviews because it hasn't gotten the media attention this one has recently been given (for some strange reason). The review it's got says she was ONLY disappointed with it because it doesn't have pictures. (Kondo's doesn't have any either.) Mellen's book has all the relevant material Kondo's has, plus much more. It does not, however, have any space wasted on how to fold your socks, thanking your clothes for protecting your body, and seemingly endless accounts of all the author's attempts to de-clutter before learning how."^1^January 24, 2016

What caught my eye first was the pictures on the covor..( I thought a few were pretty odd) but they did infact grab my attention. I read the inside of the covor and decided I would give it a try. Im so glad I did! As the story progresses you find yourself falling into it and almost becoming Jacob (the main character). You can almost visualize his experiance. Also, you become so fond of the 'Perculiar Children'. Feeling almost as if these exceptional beings are becoming your friends. I read and read and read and couldnt keep from wondering what the next page held. I hated to see the book end but maybe there could be a sequel in the making?!

Moonpie72, ^55344290^4^0^"From the first time I read a book by Ms. Wingate, she captivated me with her stories and writing.  I was very excited to read this book and it far surpassed my expectations.
I am intrigued my fictional novels that are based on true stories. The facts are true but how they are made play out in the characters’ stories lies in the hands of the author.  Through Lisa Wingate’s talent and writing skill, these individuals were literally brought to life, so much so I had to keep reminding myself they were fictional!
Until this novel I had never heard of the Tennessee Children’s Home Society spearheaded by Georgia Tann. From the 1920’s through 1950’s, hundreds of children were kidnapped by abduction or trickery from loving and caring parents. Until they were adopted by wealthy or famous people, for a hefty fee, they suffered unimaginable physical abuse, sexual assault, neglect, and with some even death. 
In 1939 a young girl, Rill, and her siblings lived happily in poverty on a house boat with their parents.   While her father and mother were at the hospital welcoming another child they were snatched away and taken to one of Ms. Tann’s “homes”.  That was when the nightmare began.  As if the heartbreak of being separated from their parents was not enough, Rill also felt the pain of trying to protect her younger siblings and keep them together in an environment of cruelty and violence. 
My heart broke at the horrors these children encountered.  I never imagined! 
The chapters alternate from Rill’s narrative to Avery Stafford in the present day.  Avery is 30, wealthy, privileged and the member of a prestigious political family, totally opposite to Rill’s experience.  When Avery attends a nursing home tour a resident appears to recognize her. She returns to visit her. In a sepia photo in May Crandall’s room she sees a family.  One of the children strongly resembles her grandmother.  She cannot get it out of her mind and begins to relentlessly seek out answers about her Grandma Judy’s past.  Could May be a part of that past?  Due to dementia claiming her grandmother’s once sharp mind she cannot ask her questions.  It’s all up to Avery.  What secrets will she unearth?  How will they change her and her family’s lives?  I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough!  An incredible book with an amazing story!  
Thank you, Lisa Wingate, for giving me the opportunity to read and review this book. The opinions I have stated are my own."^5^June 7, 2017

ilovestlouis, ^23466143^4^0^"This is a classy book. The cover is padded, and the texture gives it a hint of leather, or something more than typical slick covers. The illustrations in it are often from fandom, having each been chosen by the author because they epitomize the topic covered in a particular set of pages. The pages are not black type on white typical book pages. They are rich colors, with frequent illustrations enhancing the text. If you're a Games of Thrones fan, particularly of the books, you should love this volume that enhancing by filling in more of George Martin's world.
This was a gift for my 21 year old son. He was even more impressed with it than he thought he'd be from the literary and fan reviews and descriptions.
I shopped around, and Wal-Mart had the cheapest price. I combined it with another item (that frankly I could've just shopped for at our local stores) to reach the threshold for free shipping.

That made me worried, since I am also not a nascar fan. My friend, who suggested the book, to me that it was narrated by a dog. I thought to myself 'okay??' I was not sure what to expect. I love dogs, but don't currently own one. It was quickly apparent that I was going to love this book. The ending of the book is given away in the first chapter. But, all throughout, there is an entire life story, told from the perspective of the family dog. It's amazing. I don't think I will ever look at one of my pets, the same.

Boarding School Secret Troubles
Looking for Alaska by John Green
'I go to seek a Great Perhaps.' Miles Halter is a bit of a social misfit. He has few friends much to the chagrin of his doting parents. Feeling stifled and like an outsider in his Florida high school, he convinces his parents he wants to attend Culver Creek boarding school in Alabama. At Culver Creek, he is quickly befriended by his roommate Chip Martin (known on campus as The Colonel). A forceful personality who is one of the masterminds behind elaborate pranks, the Colonel includes Miles, or “Pudge”, in his circle of friends -- which includes a Japanese exchange student named Takumi and an attractive girl named Alaska. The Colonel fills Pudge in on the social hierarchy of Culver Creek; the boarders vs. the Weekend Warriors (the rich kids who go home on the weekend), how to outfox The Eagle (the stern headmaster), and how to camouflage smoking and hide liquor. The friends navigate the school year together; weathering difficult classes, exploring their sexuality, planning pranks, and feuding with the Weekend Warriors. Miles quickly falls into life at Culver Creek; and into love with Alaska. Never having had a girlfriend, he finds Alaska fascinating. Not only is she beautiful, but she is a free spirit. He's not the only one with feelings for Alaska -- her captivating personality and good looks has more than one boy lusting after her. Although she has a boyfriend who she says she loves, that doesn't stop her from flirting and wrapping Miles around her little finger. But Alaska clearly has some troubles in her past that lead to emotional outbursts that confuse and frighten her friends. After one particularly drunken night, a tragedy occurs that leaves the circle of friends rocked to their core. Amid the grief, confusion and guilt that follows, Miles and his friends look for answers to the mystery of Alaska and get a taste of what the Great Perhaps might hold.
I think John Green is a brilliant writer, but this book deals with a lot of mature situations like drugs, drinking, and depression. It is a very dark book so at some parts of the book I did not enjoy reading it. I also did not fall in love with or connect with any of the characters. It is hard to connect with a character like Alaska when you do not understand her mental struggles. On a good note, I loved the storyline and the setting, and the feuding of the two social spectrums of the campus; it was like West Side story. I do recommend this book , but it will set on you an emotional roller coaster."^4^December 14, 2014

WhitneyYPL, ^47700971^1^0^"Within the first ten pages of The Red Queen, I was struck by how similar it was to the Hunger Games. The more I read, the more similarities I saw to other YA books. To me, the better read you are in Young Adult fiction the worse this book becomes. It's a rehash of so many other books and quite unoriginal. The Red Queen follows Mare Barrow who lives in a world where people have two different types of blood: red and silver. Those with red blood, like Mare, are at the bottom society. Those with silver blood all have special abilities similar to that of mutants in X-men comics. Through a series of convenient circumstances Mare ends up working for the Royal Family. On the day the prince is set to choose his bride another set of convenient circumstances allow Mare to almost be killed but she isn't because she has powers too! Even though it's proven she has red blood, she is unique and this issues alarms the royal family. The rest of the story is the clichéd revolution against the oppressive rule with a love triangle thrown in too. In general, I would only recommend people who ask for a Read-A-Likes of the Hunger Games, Red Rising, Graceling etc. This book is appropriate for ages 11 and up. -RR Accelerated Reader Level: 5.2, Pts: 17"^2^October 27, 2016
LongDogMom, ^47700971^1^0^"The writing drew me in to the story immediately and kept me turning the pages. I will say that a lot of the story seemed to be things that have been done to the point of cliches...the evil stepmother, the poor to rich girl, the social class disparity and rebellions. It felt like a mix of the Hunger Games and a lot of fairy tales and fantasy I've read before. It was not hard to guess that who would betray who and some of the story, while well writtenin execution, didn't seem to quite hold up under scrutiny. Some of the powers that the Silvers had seemed too powerful to be controlled and some of the explanations for how their powers worked didn't always seem to make sense when you stopped and really thought about it. That said, and in spite of the cliches, I enjoyed the story and I will more than likely read the second book when it comes out. I think it is going to be made into a movie, and I'm not surprised because the writing was especially visual and colourful and lends itself to being seen on the big screen. I hope the second book has a few surprises and not quite as many things that felt predictable. I also felt the main character was quite naive and I'm still not sure why she felt that she had to go along with everything she was told to do. Was she afraid of being killed? Was it just to keep her family safe? I feel like she constrained herself more than they did in many ways. If being in the public eye was the reason for not killing her immediately, then why not take more chances to say her truth and use her power and position to her own advantage. Like I said... a fast read, but on closer inspection it felt like there were plot holes and threads that didn't seem to hold together as they should."^3^September 23, 2015
Elysianfield, ^47700971^1^0^"In Mare Barrow's world there's two kinds of people: those who has Red Blood and those who have Silver Blood. Those with Silver blood are 'better' people and have magical gifts while those with Red blood do not have any gifts and are more on the poor side. Those Reds who turn 18 and don't have a job, are sent into army on the war front. One night Mare meets a stranger who arranges a job for her in the court. There she discovers she has powers while it's unheard for a Red to have one and Silvers hatch a plan so the world won't discover the news.There was huge hype for this some time ago so I was little nervous to start this and I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this. I liked the idea of Silvers and Reds but I just didn't connect with the characters enough. There wasn't any chemistry between Mare and Cal, or Mare and Maven. I kinda liked Cal alone but with Mare there was no sparks flying. I liked the end but otherwise it was little slow and especially in the middle it dragged too much. And our heroine Mare... The first problem I have is with her name. First thing that comes to mind is a (female) horse. Second thing is brood mare. Can you see a theme here? Every time I read her name I wondered if we would start talking about horses. So distracting... She's just so naïve it's a wonder how she has survived this long. She tells us how good she is reading people and that she's no one's fool. Umm yeah... I don't know how many times I wanted to shake some sense into her.But as I said I liked the end, which saved the book for me and earned the third star. So it wasn't all bad."^3^November 16, 2016
TheReadingMermaid, ^47700971^1^0^"Mare is a Red in a world where Reds and Silvers have been waging war for over a hundred years. They are separated by the color of their blood. But there is a problem, Mare has the unique ability among her fellow Reds. And when the Silvers find out about it they decide to keep it a secret by making her their new princess. All seems okay at first, but things turned sinister very fast. Love, betrayal, death... how much can Mare stand before she cracks under pressure? I don't read books like this and this is why: the main characters are usually naive and annoying like nails on a chalkboard. They make you want to just jump in the book and slap some sense into them. The storylines are completely cliche and I feel like I have read them a hundred times before. And the plot twists are completely predictable and not surprising to me at all. I got a headache from rolling my eyes so much at this book. To me this book has about as much substances a stick of chewing gum. I understand that this book is very popular right now and if you are into young adult fantasy novels chances are you will probably like this one, many people do. But honestly it is just not for me in any way. I feel like I need something darker or deeper or something with more passion in it. This, to me, was like chewing a dry piece of toast. Just not my cup of tea. I would recommend this book to you if you like young adult and/or fantasy novels simply because of this book's popularity and not because of my opinion."^1^September 28, 2018
JoliesMom, ^231517^13^9^"I wanted to have something to help my daughter before she started kindergarten. I was thrilled with this.
