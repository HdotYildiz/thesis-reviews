On an amazing vacation to Alaska though, I wanted the memories preserved well, and this was a great package to help me do that.  The old quality I remember with the capacity of digital and the outstanding newer automation helps ensure that I can take quality pics in any circumstance.  It is a great camera"^5^Jul 20, 2019 10:28 AM

Everyone in the family was able to take terrific wildlife and landscape photos. My one son started to play around with the other settings to improve his shots.  The one lens did scratch around the edge. If I had to guess, it was from the lens cap. Do not twist it.  Luckily it isnt affecting our photos."^5^Jun 29, 2019 8:19 AM

However, as more and more special events became part of our calendar, I wanted some higher quality pictures for enlarging. My daughter's senior pictures, her prom pictures, and now graduation pictures are amazing. I also have some great shots of my younger daughters in-action on the softball field. Capturing these moments is a blessing and I love this camera. It's easy to use and I didn't have read the manual to get started."^5^Jun 5, 2019 8:24 AM

I think this camera is great and it works as described. I watched a few videos on the YouTube of how to use it properly and it really helped. It also has an instructions book, which I recommend to read as well if you are a beginner. So far Ive taken a few hundred of pictures and I absolutely love the quality. Im sure this camera will serve good and hope to learn more about photography till my next camera upgrade."^5^Oct 28, 2019 1:33 PM

Your sister has kind of a comprable camera that's an icon so it was kind of neat to see the differences between the two. It was a package deal that came with two lenses and a camera bag and obviously the camera. Definitely a good deal. Has some very nice features like bye-bye so you can transfer the pictures from your camera to your phone wirelessly. Takes a phenomenal picture my daughter just loves it very happy with it. She's using it for her camera class and she has in school. It came highly recommended from a friend of hers. Definitely worth the money."^5^Jun 2, 2019 8:26 AM

Looking back, I probably wouldve purchase the Rebel T7i instead, but I didnt want to spend the higher amount for my first camera. The T7 is easy to use, comes with a battery, a battery charger, the camera bag, and this set comes with the extra lens. The 75-300mm lens zooms very far. From trying out the T7i in the store, I think the pictures come out nicer on the T7i, but the T7 still takes very nice pictures. A little bit of work learning how to take good pictures with different lighting. The battery lasts for a while, could shoot for a few days (taking ~300-500 pictures a day) without the battery dying. Does not come with an HDMI cord, but I wish it did."^4^Jul 26, 2019 4:44 PM

It has descriptions as soon as you switch setting. Unlike Nikon, you have to kind of know what youre doing. Both are good quality, however I did have to return this canon about two weeks of having it. The display simply wouldnt light up, and I hadnt used it in the time.

I am an amateur photographer/videographer, exclusively using my gear for home/family work. My advice for anyone growing into this hobby is always get the most camera you are willing to bring with you. If its too heavy, too big, too complicated, too expensive, etc., you wont bring it with you and you will just be throwing away money.

The Nikon D5600 is the most camera I am willing to bring with me. The Canon T7i is a fantastic direct competitor as well, and you should give it serious consideration. At the end of the day, the T7i is slightly heavier, considerably less battery life, and more expensive. Although, it does have better autofocus, slightly faster fps burst, and in camera stabilization. Whichever you choose, they are both great overall entry level DSLR's. It comes down to what you value more. I highly value less weight and longer battery life, and the D5600 wins these categories. The Nikon D3400 and D7500 are also great choices if you simply must get Nikon. I found that the D3400 (and similar) is just missing too lacking in many features and capabilities vs the D5600. It is less weight and gets even more battery life, but they definitely cut corners on the D3400. Important corners. In fact, many cheaper and more convenient point and shoots can perform the same or better than the D3400, so why not just get something that fits in your pocket. The D7500 is better than the D5600, but again its what you value. Image quality and low light capability differences between those two are not far apart, and you would be splitting hairs to declare a winner. What you will get with the D7500 is faster fps burst with a deeper buffer, better autofocus, weather sealing, in camera focus drive (for older lenses), better shutter life expectancy, and a few other minor things. However, it is significantly heavier, double the cost, and less friendly view screen. Seasoned pro's could probably carry the D7500 just fine for hours on end. I was tired of holding it just after 15 mins. Ive carried the D5600 for 4 hours and not got tired. That means the D5600 comes with, and the D7500 does not.

After about 2000 shots and a few hours of video, I am loving my D5600. It has met or exceeded all my photography and videography expectations. And, I feel like I have room to grow with it, which is also important to me. No, it doesnt do 4k video. No, its not high bitrate. The video capabilities are for the occasional video, and its good enough for that. In find the photo capabilities to be outstanding for this price point. There are better cameras for photo, but not anywhere near this price point. I have attached two samples, since that is all BB lets you attach to reviews. These are with the 18-55VR and 70-300 (non-VR) kit lenses. The flower shot is not enhanced. The moon shot is minimally enhanced, because, well, the moon is very bright.

Speaking of the lenses, dont listen to the naysayers. The 18-55VR and 70-300 (non-VR) are both very capable and perfectly serviceable lenses. The 18-55VR is a no brainer, and you should absolutely get that one if you dont already have it. The 70-300 is not VR and that is a con in some situations. It is mostly a tripod lens, but that doesnt mean you cant get at least ok shots with it (see moon shot). The 55-200 VR is currently on sale around one fifty, you should consider that instead or in addition to the 70-300 non-VR. Yes, there are better lenses than these. However, they can get very expensive really quick. For the price of these three lens you cant go wrong.

In summary, this is a great entry level DSLR that rivals much more expensive cameras where it counts, yet is small and light enough that you will want to bring it with you all the time. Sure, it doesnt get 4k video. Its not going to get the low light capabilities of the full frames. It doesnt have ridiculously fast bursts with a buffer as deep as the ocean. As far as all around shooters go, however, you would be hard pressed to find this many features and capabilities in this small and light package, and anywhere near this price point (outside of the Canon T7i). Eventually, mirrorless interchangeable cameras may render the entry level DSLR obsolete, but that day is not today. If thats your thing, great. Have at it. Make sure to bring 3-4 extra batteries and a bucket of ice. If you dont want to spend your day changing batteries and continually have to stop for the camera to cool down, the D5600 is a great choice for smaller and lighter."^5^Jul 1, 2018 3:30 PM

For 5 years I worked as a photographer shooting weddings, portraits and selling an occasional fine art print. For that work I used Canon gear to include the 5D3, 5D2, 6D and L lenses. Due to a personal issue that arose I sold all of my Canon gear in 2015. I am thus purchasing camera gear with a clean slate without being locked into any manufacturer. I owned Olympus mirrorless E-M5 and E-PM2 for the past year but did not feel that they offered an upgrade path that would support low light photography should I choose to photograph weddings again in the future. The new E-M1 II does not appear to offer an improvement to ISO that I would personally consider useable beyond ISO 1600.

I chose Best Buy so that I could compare 5 camera bodies in person: Canon SL2, T7i and 80D. Nikon D5600 and D7200. Ultimately I chose the D5600 due to size, features and build quality. I have found ISO 3200 to be very good and also believe ISO 6400 can be very good IF the picture is properly exposed. I have not attempted ISO values beyond that. 

I did successfully use SnapBridge this morning to connect and transfer images to my IPhone 6+. I certainly would like to see the app improved and made more streamlined and easier but it is useable with my phone. I transfered images, edited them in PhotoShop Express and used the phone as a remote to the camera. 

I am looking forward to learning all of the features this camera offers and acquiring some high quality prime lenses to use with it. 

Highly recommended!"^5^Aug 13, 2017 10:40 AM

(See caution below)
I was shooting at a conference when my trusty older Pentax stopped working. So, I ran out and bought the D5600 kit at Best Buy - it was on sale. The kit comes with two basic lenses that sync up beautifully with the body. Both have AutoFocus but only one has the built in image stabilization. If you have basic photo knowledge, you can be taking photos as soon as the battery is charged - it took about 2 hours to charge mine. Once you get past the basics, there will be a learning curve to get to the point where you can smoothly access the wide range of advanced features, but, once you can, the D5600 should fill most of your photographic needs. Nikon does have a more basic model (D3500), but, if you can manage the price difference, the D5600 is worth the step up. 
Note of caution: the 5600 and the 3500 are designed to work with AF lenses with a motor built into the lens. Older Nikon compatible AF lenses need a motor built into the camera body. The 3500 and 5600 do not have a built in AF motor. If you've already made an investment into Nikon equipment or if you want to expand your lens collection with older lens through store sales or through Ebay, you should save for the D7500 (or the older D7200 also at an excellent price on Best Buy). The newer lenses with the built in motors are a little pricey making legacy lens very attractive. Also keep in mind, image stabilization is not built into the 5600 or 7500 or any Nikon camera. It is another feature that is built into certain higher priced lens. Again a lot of mint condition legacy lens are available if you shop around, but there will be no image stabilization. Meaning your next purchase should be a good tripod for photos where hand shake would be a concern.
I did end up returning the D5600 and getting the D7200 body only instead. It was an economic decision. At this point I can't swing the cost of all new, state of the art lenses. So, I chose some legacy glass on Ebay. 
4 stars because it took some intensive research to realize I would need all new expensive lens with built in motors. Had I known that going in, I would have saved time (and a restocking fee) and gone up a level right away. But you have been forewarned, so you can make your choice and be confident tha the D5600 will take great photos."^4^Mar 21, 2019 7:01 PM

So instead, let me say it like this: this camera is easy enough to figure out for someone who is brand new to photography, and it still has a high enough resolution to make killer/professional looking photos. It has features in it that will help you grow and learn such as bracketing, back button focusing, exposure compensation/exposure editing, and it shoots raw files which you can edit in camera. 

If none of those words meant anything to you, thats okay. You can still pick this up, set it to auto, hit the button, and get awesome photos without learning any of it. 

However, if you want to learn it all and make photography a hobby or even become a beginning pro, this camera can do the job."^5^May 25, 2019 3:46 AM

The battery provides a long time frame of a charge. Also the charger provides about 1 1/2 hours to fully charge the battery.

This camera is SO much better. Honestly, you wouldn't think there would be such a huge jump in its main functions and capabilities, but there really is. I think what I like most about this camera is it's ability to auto focus while it's recording video. No other canon camera model does this. It's the first of its kind. I'm also really enjoying the moveable LCD screen. I can adjust it to any position I need it, and I can flip it 180 degrees to show others the photos I had taken. Naturally, when you flip the screen, the photo will flip too. The screen is also a touch screen which is pretty cool. Another nice feature is that they made it more friendly for beginners. It has a guide that will tell you what each setting is for, and walk you through it just to make sure you have things set right. Naturally, this setting can be turned off for the more advanced users. They also have a few new filters and pucture options built in such as HDR art, candlelight dinner, fisheye lens effect, etc. the fisheye lens effect is especially nice. It does a really good job of mimicking an actual fish lens. If you like the look, you won't have to go out and buy the lens now. This camera also has an inhouse stabilizer option for filming, which is definitely a plus. They improved the inhouse microphone since the t5, but not by much. Overall, would highly recommend this product."^5^Jul 19, 2017 5:44 PM

The only problem I see is I should have bought the body only since the kit lens is now a base f4, which lets a little less light in than prior kit lenses at f3.5. What this does is when taking shots inside in Auto the ISO gets jacked up by the camera which can introduce a little 'noise' which you may or may not notice, or causes a slower shutter speed than you might like for moving things like kids and dogs inside. The lens is fine if you like outdoor shots but for inside I wish I saved the $100 and got the body only with either the 24mm 2f2.8 Prime/fixed lens or the 'nifty fifty' 50mm f1.8 lens, or the Sigma 17-50mm 2.8 lens. All those lenses let more light in for indoor shots, so it just depends what you are looking to do. Also I borrowed my friend's Sony a6000 with a $350 20mm pancake lense which I felt took sharper pictures. All in all this is a good entry to mid level SLR camera that has a nice heft and the lenses are cheap (the 2 Canon lenses - 24mm and 50mm and both under $150). I also got the 55-250 f4 Telephoto zoom lens for $150 (usually $300) and it is really sharp and gives nice blur to the background.

Please note that I do have some experience with cameras (just didn't want to spend too much for a knock around camera for taking pics of kids and dogs and landscapes) and if you don't like the idea of swapping out lenses and/or you are a novice this camera and lens kit are probably more of a 4.5 stars."^4^Mar 2, 2018 4:49 PM

Now if youve never used a DSLR before the T7i might seem like quite a large camera, but in fact compared to most DSLRs, its actually quite small. Just for comparisons sake Ive a Canon 70D right here and it really makes the T7i feel very light. And to me thats a great thing. Because the T7i is a little smaller, I think that this means youll be more likely to take it out with you and to take more photos. For beginners and intermediates thats a great thing. Now I used the Canon T6i a lot last year and not too much has changed on the body of the T7i.Buttons are exactly where youd want them to be and easy enough to find.
Like i said in my review of the Canon 77D however, I do wish the buttons were a little more pronounced because they are a little flat and hard to find when youve got your eye up to the viewfinder. At the top of the camera here youll notice that this is a little to the bigger brother the 77D. On the right the camera, we have your main mode dial. Essentailyl this where you can change the different setting that you want to shoot in whether that be automatic or the manual modes. One thing youll notice is that in the T7i youre missing the mode dial lock that we saw on the 77d. This isnt a huge deal to me but its one thing to be careful with so you dont accidentally change your settings. At the top here we have a dedicated record button which is nice to see as well.
So overall the build quality is nice on the T7i. Its definitely a smaller build than most DSLRs which could be a big bonus if you like to travel or walk around with a lighter camera."^5^Apr 3, 2018 10:10 PM

The other models, such as the 70D, are too big and heavy for me. The difference between the T6i and T7i is great. The pictures are so much clearer, and the camera with the kit lens seems 'faster'. Of course, all of my previously purchased lenses/flashes work with the T7i. This model also has additional features and filters that the T6i did not (or at least I couldn't find them). There is a built-in level that is easy to use, and creative filters, such as a fish-eye and artistic colors. I was very sad when my T6i broke, but once I saw this camera in action, I felt better about it. This camera is wonderful!"^5^Nov 27, 2017 8:43 AM

It has a lighter body, greater megapixels, and autofocus for video. However, the slight downside is it has a softer focus that can only be seen when previewed on computer or laptop. If you're looking through the camera's monitor, it'll look great but when doing a manual focusing, it'll have a softer focus than my previous T3i. I don't really know what's wrong with it. Everything else works great but the softer focus does set me off sometimes especially doing portraits. Otherwise, it's a great camera for a beginner and definitely a step up from the older Canon T models."^4^Nov 24, 2017 2:05 AM

What I wanted was a camera with a flip monitor for my youtube videos, not that I was complaining about my sony.. so I ventured, took the plunge and decided to get this Canon. I had only owned previously one canon camera (film) and one camcorder. I found it very hard to operate it despite it appearing to be user friendly and relatively basic. There was no usb cable included and to wirelessly transmit to phone or computer, was very complex and unreliable. I also ordered the wireless remote separately from B&H photo in New york since Best Buy did not carry the canon wireless remote, and then finally I figured out how to connect the remote to the camera. There were no instructions anywhere on how to operate this remote.. people had complained online, I kept reading reviews right and left trying to dig info and finally i saw that people found information on the remote on canon India website. So when the canon camera was on tripod and I would try to operate it, at times the screen would go crazy and move by itself.. I ended up returning it and now best buy has introduced a 15 percent restocking fee on purchases done in June and going forward, so think carefully before you buy it. I still love photography and ended up ordering from best buy a very expensive camera lens for my sony.. which should arrive this week."^2^Jun 12, 2017 3:30 PM

This is a great starter camera if you're serious about learning photography with lots of features and manual capabilities too. Why buy a Canon instead of the Nikon...

I've been using Canon 6D instead for the past three years, and I think that it's one of the best values in camera world. I hesitated to even try out the new 5D MkIV and was contemplating jumping ship over to Sony and their amazing a7R II. Well, I can say I'm extremely glad I went with MkIV. Camera is a huge upgrade from 6D in every sense, especially AF, but also enormous sensor quality upgrade compared to 5D MkIII. I'm using 1DX MkII as well, and I prefer 5D MkIV. Camera body is very light, super responsive, AF performance is on par with 1DX MkII, but sensor is simply phenomenal. Dynamic range is 90% identical to Sony a7R II but you get to keep Canon's beautiful colors and skin tones. 30Mpx is plenty (I'm printing 24x36 regularly) and the files are simply beautiful. I'm not shooting lots of video, but from what I've seen so far, the quality is stunning.

It's my first full frame DSLR camera which I selected after many hours of research. Research can drive one crazy as there's so much material (ads, videos, reviews, reviewer's and personal preferences, etc.) to read before making a decision about such a large purchase. Do the research though to make sure you get the right camera for you. After nearly 3 weeks in Europe I'm sure I made the right choice. Performance was flawless and operation was easy on this feature-rich camera, Menus are complete, concise and rational. This is hugely important as making adjustments is fast - no searching through excessive or confusing menus to find what you need. While some camera menus systems are good some are absolutely Byzantine! Canon's is, IMO, the best. This is also my first Canon after being a lifetime Nikon shooter. Solid construction and great materials are evident. Button layout and overall ergonomics provide me the easiest handling for a camera of this size and weight. Other cameras of this level (which were all great) just didn't seem as easy to handle or were as nimble in my hands. Not having any full frame lenses made the brand change easy for me. As is said 'One buys a camera but marries the lens system.' IMO it is difficult if not impossible to beat Canon L glass. Some reviewers did not rate this camera at the top for video performance but the few videos I experimented with looked really excellent to me. I'm not a skilled videographer so take that into account. Still shots are off the chart amazing though. The features of this camera are mind-boggling! I was able to learn a limited number of features and modes before my trip so I was able to get some amazing shots. I expect better after I've read the rest of the 600+ page owner's manual.

I considered switching to one of the high end Nikons which have even more megapixels but elected to stay with the Canon in order to keep using the lenses I already have. A few days after the camera arrived I took it on hiking/photography trip to Great Basin in Nevada and Bryce Canyon in Utah. The camera worked flawlessly and took excellent pictures even in the fully automatic setting. Setting up the Canon software that came with the camera was straightforward, though I use Lightroom to process the pictures rather than the Canon software. I used the camera to shoot a number of pictures in Bryce at night with a full moon and the camera performed well. I used the Canon app to operate the camera in the dark which meant that I could dispense with a cable release/remote. The app is not entirely intuitive, but it works well and allows you to operate the camera remotely with ease. I have had the camera for only a month, but so far it has been excellent and without defect."^5^Oct 11, 2018 10:05 PM

Two tips - make sure to format all your memory cards in exFAT to prevent the video's being broken into 4GB segments.

The full frame sensor is fabulous and it has low noise at high ISOs. The 30 megapixels enables significant cropping before losing any quality. I have a tendency to tilt the camera before shooting, the in-viewfinder level eliminates this issue. I have taken both vivid sunsets and low light fall foliage with remarkable results. It is a tremendous piece of technology that takes some time getting acclimated.

I have owned the mk3 the 6d the t3i and the t2i. I am heavily invested in canon and their glass so I was extremely excited and waited a very long time for this camera to come out.
I purchased it from the local Best Buy in launch day, it is a spectacular camera for stills and 1080p video. The autofocus system is excellent, it's fast and even in live view it is nearly as fast as it is through the viewfinder.
I also love the touch screen it makes navigating the menu and making adjustments so much quicker and you can pinch to zoom on your pictures.
I had a major problem with the 4K though, the codec this camera stores it in is so huge that it was unusable on my early 2016 MacBook Pro. It would lag while watching it and even trying it edit it was nearly impossible. I'm unsure why canon went with such huge codec but I returned it because of this. It's not enough different for me to justify the expense with the 4K codec. I will just wait for the next 6d and hope the issue is resolved by then. If your looking for a great stills camera by all means get this bad boy, if you have a mk3 and want a 4K upgrade its not quite there yet unfortunately"^3^Sep 11, 2016 10:11 PM

BEST images i've ever seen. Now for the bad news. Coming from a Nikon D800, the 5D button layout is horrible. The nikon is way more friendly to the user (except for the confusing menu's in nikon). Canons menus are much much better. However, I despise the shared function of buttons on the 5D and where they are make no sense really. If i could put nikon's buttons on this camera, it would be 5++ stars.

Camera takes great detailed photos and the photo sync with my phone is a great feature.

Advice Id give is to skip the more expensive kit with the zoom lense and use the saved money on a 50mm fixed lense if your using it for an all around camera. The 300mm lense has no vibration reduction so a tripod is recommended.

Attached is a photo I took with my D3500 with 50mm lense."^5^Aug 16, 2019 5:28 PM

Obviously the improvements over that time is leaps and bounds. Our older Nikon lenses work without issue. If you are in the mode that uses the back screen to view before taking picture, the shutter is rather loud and takes a bit longer between pics, as the shutter and mirror have to do extra steps -- but using the traditional eye-hole view is quick and quiet."^5^Jan 12, 2019 8:16 AM

The lack of a microphone input is a bummer, and I miss having a Manual-Auto Focus switch on the kit lens, but having said that, the autofocus is much quieter than a similar but older Nikon 18-55 zoom I have. And since I record audio separately anyway (as anyone doing quality audio would) the lack of a mic input is not that big of a deal. For still photography it's really terrific quite light and small, with some very intuitive automatic modes. And I LOVE the ability to override autofocus with a quick grab of the focus ring. Even at full price it's a great value, but when you get it on sale it's a steal. One more thing: the face-tracking focus is really effective!"^5^Jan 11, 2019 7:15 PM

Cons: No IR remote.
I bought this camera on Black Friday with the 18-55mm lens as an upgrade from point-and-shoot cameras to a DSLR. I skipped the 70-300mm kit lens because it doesn't have VR, something that benefits telephoto lenses the most. A VR version of the 70-300mm lens is available and worth the extra cost.
I'm disappointed that the ML-L3 IR remote that works with most Nikon DSLRs doesn't work with this one. Why would Nikon make a camera that requires a non-Nikon accessory like a smartphone in order to use all its capabilities? Even the new Coolpix P900 can use that remote. The new 'special effects' option doesn't make up for the lack of the IR remote. Maybe they could bring back the mechanical cable release like I had on my Nikon film cameras."^3^Dec 19, 2018 6:27 PM

AlBro^/canon-eos-90d-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-135mm-lens-black/6373129?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^20^0^"After EXTENSIVE research on which camera to purchase, I've decided to go with the newly released 90D. 4K video recording at 29.97fps, Canon's improved Dual Pixel AF, and the included headphone jack for audio monitoring were HUGE selling points to me. I also went with the 18-135mm lens simply to have more range when it comes to shooting, vs being stuck with the 18-55mm kit lens. But I'll soon be purchasing more lenses anyways, this lens in particular is better for people who want an 'all around' lens. 

Pros- 32.5 MP, DIGIC 8 processor, Dual Pixel AF with 45 all cross type AF points, non cropped 4K video (yes it is an APS-C sensor so it already has a 1.6x crop but there is no additional crop when shooting 4K like older DSLR'S) Feels great in the hand (good grip, good build quality) and Canon's easy to use interface is always a win.

Cons- Although lighter than the 80D by 29 grams, it's still a heavy camera compared to modern day Mirrorless cameras. Being just released a few weeks ago at the time of this review it's pricey. Assuming the price will fluctuate when people see this review, I paid $1,599 for the 90D, 18-135mm lens, battery, and the battery charger. Would have been nice to see a creator bundle (mic, extra battery, carrying case!!!)

Conclusion:

The market is slowly moving to mirrorless cameras, but this DSLR still has some things I need as a film maker and photographer that a mirrorless camera still doesn't have at a reasonable price. This camera even has many features that new mirrorless cameras have! It's the best of both worlds. Grab yourself a 90D if you're looking to upgrade, or get it as your first camera like me."^5^Sep 24, 2019 11:52 PM

I travel for a living so I always have the camera engaged in my travels; both business and personally.

I have a Canon 6D Mark ll body and a Canon 5d Mark iV body. Both are stunning cameras but heavy.

Along comes Canon's SL3. Still a SLR but at a fraction of the price. Made of plastic. Made in Taiwan. Lightweight (sometimes even cheap). I disliked Canon's SL1 and SL2 models so I'm very impressed that their SL3 is such a performer.

SPECS can be found on Canon's website if you're looking for details. However, I first want to add that this camera has Canon's fast-performance DIGIC 8 processor. For reasons unknown, Canon introduced the DIGIC 8 on the SL3. It's a 2019 processor of high speed and amazing performance. Expect no shutter lag, no lighting issues and when paired with a good-quality SD card (I use 300MB SD cards from SanDisk), the camera does everything you could expect of a $1500-$2500 body for basic shooting.

It's underpriced. It's a value for certain.

What I do dislike about it is the inferior lens that comes with the camera when you buy the KIT VERSION. It's a plastic, cheaply designed and low performance starter lens. It is a EF-S lens but the SL3 will take both EF and EF-S lenses. Thankfully I have many EF L-Series lenses and it's a much better camera when using a quality lens.

Very impressive SLR from Canon."^4^May 10, 2019 4:08 PM

You can shoot it as a DSLR with a nice, clear optical viewfinder with 9 focusing points or you can shoot it as a 'mirrorless' camera using the back screen which gives you many more focus point, eye AF and Canon's legendary Dual Pixel Auto Focus that smoothly acquires focus without hunting back and forth. For video people, you can clean HDMI output to an external recorder and get 4:2:2 10 bit at 4k! The new Canon 90D doesn't have this feature according to the specs. The battery life is unbelievably good and will outlast ANY mirrorless camera by far. THE BAD: 4K looks great but is not very flexible in as much as you have only 23.98P and no DPAF! Rolling shutter is pretty bad in 4K. Also, 4K has an additional crop so you'll really need a wide lens for it to be useable. This camera has two levels of electronic image stabilization which works with Canon's optically stabilized lens but crops your video further still! The sensor is really clean and almost free of noise at 6400 ISO and is very useable up to 12,800 with level one high ISO noise reduction turned on. I didn't see any improvement from 1,2, or 3 in terms of in-camera NR. The SL3 has a setting that makes the camera take 4 photos every time you press the shutter which it samples and then produces a single noise-free The creative filters are actually really handy and in some cases can provide a more interesting photo than even the most experienced photographer could take.  It has focus-peaking for manual focus or focus-pulling and the autofocus on the back screen does an incredible job following faces or whatever your subject is, keeping them in focus."^5^Aug 30, 2019 4:08 PM

Ive taken some wonderful pictures with those cameras and will always keep one for the sheer convenience.  It has to be said though, that these cameras will always be limited by their lenses or rather their lack of options.  That was my main reason for stepping back into the SLR realm.

I chose the SL3 because it looked to be a good step as a DSLR while maintaining many of the features Ive become comfortable with in the point and shoots.  I had a done a lot of research on it predecessor the SL2 and went to look at it and was told that the SL3 had just been released so I snatched one up.  Its very easy to use and will actually tutor you as you use it.  Gives helpful suggestions but you can turn those off if youd rather not.  Has a good Auto focus and in the full automatic setting it is consistent.  

I would recommend not buying the kit with the 18/55 mm lens.  Buy the body and go an extra few hundred bucks for a better lens.  The kit lens feels cheap but does an adequate job.  Its very plastic.

All in all, its a good buy and easy, step into DSLRs.  Priced under 600.00, its hard to beat and Canon packed all of its latest and greatest features into it."^4^Jul 20, 2019 8:21 PM

This is the first one I have ever not liked 'out of the box.' It is difficult to use the camera in shutter priority or aperture priority because you have to figure our how to find the right display mode first. There is no place on the top of the camera for a no flash setting. Apparently you can't have 'no flash' in the automatic setting. The guide that comes with the book is pretty useless and the advanced user guide that you can download is 500 pages.

I also edit video so I wanted a camera that would take excellent video and I needed nice pictures so the 24 megapixels fit what I was looking for. Long story short, I'm blown away at the quality of this camera, I'm able to keep it in auto focus mode and everything turns out so amazing that I take a picture of, it's impossible to take a bad picture. I was more than pleased with the quality of this product. I looked at the microphone and originally thought the rode videomic go would sound cheesy since it has a frequency response up to 15khz if I remember correctly, but once I hooked up the microphone I never questioned it again, it picks up great audio, sounds professional on every level.

I'm new to DSLR shooting and yes, any lower end DSLR would've worked fine. But if you want to learn the functions and get the most out of the package, this is what you need to get. Yes, its pricey but the build quality and capabilities are amazing. Do I want to start a vlog like Casey Neistat, probably not. Do I want the option to? Yes. I want to video my 2 year old, capture moments and memories, and yes, any camera will do. Except, this does it better. I see this camera as a Semi-Pro rig, feels great, shoots great, looks great. The lens was designed for this camera. Sure you can buy a kit that has two lenses but why? This lens captures the full range. Did I mention 'weather resistance' its just built better than a Rebel. 

Is it heavy? Sort of. Will it be a pain to carry? Maybe. I also bought the mirrorless version, the new Canon M5, its nice to carry, but doesn't 'feel' as nice to shoot, not as easy to compose a shot (because its much smaller)"^5^Dec 14, 2016 4:59 PM

I opted for the video creator kit specifically for a new venture with my business and doing some vlogging, product review videos, and various other projects. I was upgrading my system from a much older Canon DSLR. This camera has very fast AF which was a must for me. On top of that, the image processing chip and image sensor itself is fantastic! This camera in combination with great lenses is able to provide some of the nicest images you will see from DSLRs on the market. It certainly is not a top-end camera but it provides images that can rival them. There are certainly a few things I do not like but not enough for me to knock off stars. The menu selection wheel is a bit cumbersome but with some getting used to, it simply is not that big of a deal to me. I can see what the Canon engineers were trying to do but you can essentially do the same things by simply using the touch screen which I prefer anyway. Overall this camera is a gem and at a great price point. You can spend a lot less but not get a body that is as sturdy or reliable. The power zoom accessory takes some getting used to though. It is basically included for free in this combo and it worth trying. It adds some smooth zooming for video which is great. Again, practice with it and spend some time perfecting it and I think you will like it."^5^Nov 21, 2016 12:03 PM

Snappy autofocus, 18-135 lens is a great every-situation lens (could be sharper and have a lower F-stop, but that would blow this kit's price) good ergonomics, and the touch screen is a joy. In fact, the touch screen makes this lens; being able to rapidly and intuitively change settings with minimal fuss is great.

The bad: At time of purchase, and at time of review, the website states 'An additional battery pack ensures the Canon EOS 80D video creator kit has plenty of power'. Cause of this language, I assumed this kit came with an additional battery pack, but it does not. This unit comes with only 1 battery, which is disappointing considering that a full day of filming requires several batteries."^5^Sep 28, 2017 1:21 PM

At this price point for me it was between the Sony A6300/6500 and the Canon 80d. To be honest both the cameras have an equal amount of pros and cons. For me the 80D felt more comfortable in my hands (even though it is a lot heavier). Also the articulating screen is awesome. The battery on the 80D lasts forever and there are a ton of affordable lenses out there as well. If you are adamant about having 4K you may want to go to Sony, but the colors and quality of the 1080 the 80D shoots is great. The 80D wont let you down! I am glad I finally made the investment! And the video creator kit is great because not only do you save money buying the kit but you pick up the 18-135 lens which is a great all purpose lens, the powerzoom is a nifty tool and the rode mic is awesome!!"^5^May 20, 2018 8:36 AM

Decided to go digitally and purchased the Nikon this time, because my daughter purchased a similar Nikon kit as we can share lenses.
Took this camera on a trip to Alaska and took beautiful pics.   I particularly like the SnapBridge feature, as it allowed me to immediately download the pics to my phone and laptop.   The D7500 is user friendly.

The only downside is the 18-55m lens as it has a button on the outer barrel which causes confusion on the focus and lock.   I had to turn the camera off and on to reset the focus.   Perhaps I need to take a camera course at BestBuy to relearn how to use this lens properly.    This was a minor inconvenience.  The 70-300mm lens however does not have this button and is easier to work with.

Kudos to my saleswoman, Kayleigh, at the Princeton NJ BestBuy as she took the time to explain the various features and comparisons on the digital camera brand selections.   She also was extremely helpful with the explanation of features, sale, and preparation of the Nikon camera and recommended accessories for my vacation trip.  I will give her my future business and recommend her to family and friends who wish to purchase a camera in the future."^5^Sep 1, 2019 4:30 AM

I was very impressed with the higher end cameras but stayed within budget picking a comfortable, built to endure d7500, incase I do go on that Antarctic trip.
  The kit lenses are ideal for learning the 'how tos' and pretty much all one needs for travel, bird, wildlife, portraits, astrophotography, family, events etc. Get a 10-20mm flat wide angle lens and that would pretty much fill the gaps.
 Don't forget lens cleaning kit if you don't already have one and some clear protective lens filters, extra battery and some high quality memory cards."^5^Aug 23, 2019 11:54 PM

We are getting truly clear balanced stills and maybe better than iPhone videos. Not heavy. We recommend it highly for an every day every situation shooter - the perfect bring along camera. Note - there is a learning curve with these dslrs. And we transfer photos by removing the memory card and inserting it into our Mac - simple."^4^Jun 1, 2019 11:56 AM

After receiving it I saw that the lenses are very low quality. Many pictures, even those not taken in direct sunlight, suffered from chromatic aberration to the point many birds I photographed had glowing blue and purple wings. Even those in shadow on my deck inexplicably glowed to the point I could either spend hours re-touching countless pictures in Photoshop or just be left with a poor quality picture. My $120 Canon point and shoot from 2015 takes better pictures in this regard because it does not produce this color fringing. 

I also had a lot of difficulty getting the auto-focus to work correctly. There are a multitde of tracking options but it seemed regardless of what I chose the camera had difficulty recognizing the bird from the background scenery and the bird ended up out of focus. Most pictures came out blurry to varying degrees, to the point where even a duck sitting still in the middle of the pond was fuzzy. Not all this can be blamed on the auto-focus but also speaks to the low quality of the lenses.

Lastly, this is a full DSLR with a ton of menu options and configurations. The instructions are less than helpful because they only tell you a feature exists, not how to use it or what exactly it can even do in some cases. I had to end up watching videos and tutorials online but still found it very complicated to get the right balance of shutter speed, aperature, ISO, and metering system to produce a decent quality image. This camera can in theory shoot at 1/8000th of a second, which for birds sounds amazing, but upon trying it all my pictures came out almost entirely black. To compensate you have to crank the ISO to absurd levels and that introduces too much grain and noise for the picture to be usable. Even at 1/2500th speed the quality takes a hit as other factors need to be changed to let enough light in. Instead of going fully manual you can set one factor and let the camera auto calibrate the others for best results, but even with that most were too dark or too light because it mis-judged them and gave me an unusable image. Considering I mainly bought it to take pictures of birds which are very active and do not remain sitting still on a branch for more than a few seconds I don't have time to be fumbling with the settings and reconfiguring the values until I get the right combination. Auto-focus and other adjustments need to work immediately and that was the biggest failing of this camera aside from the horrid color fringing issues, which admittedly I think are mainly the fault of the lens. I used the 70-300mm one which I believe retails for $400 alone. I'm honestly surprised for that price the quality was so bad.

What I'm saying is this is NOT a beginner friendly DSLR and the picture quality from these bundled kit lenses was not greatly better than my previously mentioned point and shoot, and in many cases worse. If you have a kid that puts this on their Christmas list think twice about it, because even though the camera itself is probably decent, it's going to be severely held back by these included lenses. You're better off buying the camera alone and spending much, much more money on better quality lenses, but at what cost? I only got this because it was a bargain on sale at $999 but was not even worth that price. Best Buy forced me to pay $150 just to return it, which I find absurd since I had returned another bad camera to them in 2015 for free (also Nikon btw). I feel scammed but paid just to be done with the aggravations this camera brought me and losing $150 is better than wasting $1000 on something I'll never want to use again. Very upset Best Buy changed their camera return policy and will doubtful be buying from them again since I lost a lot of money buying this product."^1^Jun 2, 2019 4:22 PM

One of which is Canons new Digic 7 processor that the 6d mark ii houses. I use my camera for both photo and video, and even though the 6d mark ii does not have 4K for video, it is still a great choice for creators, and to be honest, you dont necessarily need 4K. One day yes, I will see it as a necessity, but for now as long as you have the skills and a passion for creating, 1080 will do just fine.

My 70D beats it for IQ and according to tests, the 80D does too for DR, both of which are crop-sensor bodies. I really, really, REALLY wanted a FF body with an articulating screen (more for filmmaking and night-sky work), but this really, truly is a step BACK from the original 6D. Sure it has some bells and whistles, but at the end of the day, it's IQ I'm seeking (I don't care about how AF works if the image SUCKS!)

Playing with this for a few weeks until concluding that my 70D, a 6D and a 5DMKII had superior IQ and DR where it counted and this body having an insanely knackered ISO calibration, I sent to Canon for calibration (at my expense, yes under warranty, but they didn't offer to pay to have it shipped to them, I had to pay for that..., for a TWO-WEEK old camera!). They returned and it was DOA. I am sure it did not leave Canon that way, but the box was intact with no damage, water, etc., no one has a clue why. So it went BACK to Canon and there it sits. I had to rent another body for a low-light shoot this weekend. No telling when I'll get my 'new' camera back and they claim they'll repair or send me a refurbished one for replacement. Great. Buy a new camera and a month and a half later, you get a refurb/old camera. Canon has seriously gone down hill. I'd get a 5DMK4 if I could afford, but rare shoots pay enough for that kind of kit now. At least for what I shoot anyway. I'd suggest you get a new/old-stock 70D or an 80D (not really much more than the 70D) if you want IQ and better DR at low ISO. Avoid this until Canon wises up and just puts the 5DMK4 sensor in it. Then it'll be worthy of it's price."^2^Nov 30, 2018 8:59 PM

The 6D Mark II is clearly a worthy upgrade over the 6D. I've read many so-so reviews on the Mark II, but I think many of these reviewers have unrealistic expectations. The Mark II is an entry level full-frame camera, but has many very worthwhile features for the enthusiast. I've had the Mark II about a month and the still photos that I've taken are stunning. It's a fun camera that is capable of producing great results. If you need a 4K video and/or dual card slots then the 6D Mark II is not for you.

The AF in low light along with the superb full frame CMOS sensor delivers a noticeable enough difference in image quality and depth to justify the purchase. This was my first venture into the full frame line up and it has allowed me to be much more creative in low light close quarters without seeing any real noise. The only drawback for me is the 6.5 fps as I do a lot of fast action, thus, a slightly slimmer chance of framing the 'perfect' shot. Perfectly accepted as a tradeoff. I am anxious to try out the 4K video time lapse feature. I have attached two pictures that were taken at night in normal room low lighting. Details are on the pictures."^5^Dec 16, 2017 1:23 PM
MEKELLY00^/canon-eos-6d-mark-ii-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/5959400?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I still own the previous version of this camera body. At the time it was a HUGE step up from my aging crop-sensor 50D. Full frame brought me back to my 35mm roots and I'm loving it. Canon made a number of improvements on this second version of the 6D. For starters, Auto focus points.... MUCH more on this camera. Is it more than the 5D MK IV? No, but still it has (45) of them and they are cross-type. I would have preferred that they were not so clustered together, and that Canon would have spread them out more over the viewing area, but still a huge much needed and welcome step up. There is a considerable bump in image size from 20.6 to 26.2 but nothing to get overly excited about there. There are complaints from a lot of pro reviewers and and tech outlets that the 6D Mk II has a very limited dynamic range. Well, if it does I am not seeing it. I put the camera to the test with some low key lighting setups right out of the gate, and it has not disappointed me yet. There are a couple of sample images attached for review. So, unless you are shooting in some horrendous conditions and you don't know how to compensate, I really don't think Dynamic range should be too much of a concern. I was also wanting more FPS (frames per second), and this MkII doubles that compared to the 6D. Up from 3 FPS to 6.5 FPS. So great improvement there. Lots of complaints and hemming and hawing about the lack of 4k video capability on this camera as well..... BIG DEAL! Its made to be a feature limited full frame pro-am camera anyways... what did you expect? On the plus side Canon did give us auto focus tracking on the Mk II which they did not have on the 6D Mk I. So when you do decide to shoot some video the auto focus automatically tracks your subject without you having to manually refocus all the time. The flip out screen I was on the fence about, but I like it for a couple of reasons. One, you can flip it over when the camera isn't in use to protect the screen from getting all scratched up. Two, it's kinda handy when shooting at extremely awkward angles. The touch screen I don't really care for. I could do without it, but it is nice to be able to jump to a completely different part of the in camera menu without having to scroll through all of the headers to get where you want. There are a couple of the things that are annoying me at present. I can't get this camera to auto rotate my images. I don't mind turning the camera to the side to see my portrait images full screen. I just wish it would do that itself. My bigger issue is Canon felt the need to over complicate HSS (High Speed Sync) on this camera body. It should just work. I use HSS capable off camera studio strobes, but the HSS feature doesn't work for some reason. It works fine on my original 6D MK I, but on the Mk II I need to setup HSS on the in camera menu, and I keep getting an error message saying that my flash is not compatible even though it is listed as a compatible device. So maybe an update on that later. 
In closing, this camera is a beast of an upgrade if you are coming from a 6D MK I or lower. If you are contemplating spending some extra cheddar on the 5D MK IV, consider the following....
All you are really getting for that $1600 is 4k video capability, 20 more auto focus point that are more spread out, slightly better dynamic range, 1.5 FPS faster continuous shooting, and a small resolution bump.
If that's worth $1600.00 then go for that big rig and tear it up, but if not this camera is definitely suited for professional and by no means should be considered and 'entry level camera for beginners'."^4^Apr 29, 2019 5:48 PM

For $1800 after tax I got the camera and the STM 24-105 Lens. And have been learning AP mode and manual mode (the dog pictures I uploaded are in manual) and I am getting much better results than auto mode. The auto focus is great and use it more than manual focus. 

Image quality is great, comparing it to budget DSLR's like the Rebel it is a night and day difference. The STM isn't mentioned much in reviews, It is good for an all around lens, but I will certainly get a nicer lens for detailed portraits, It isn't very sharp when zoomed past 50 but I don't have the $ for a high end lens right now.  

After uploading the pictures on photoshop or light room I noticed the colors seem a little 'washed out' which I read in several pro reviews so it isn't just me. But the image quality is just amazing, I can't put this camera down and can't wait to take it out on weekends. I would use this camera for anything from weddings to portraits, street photography, landscapes, what ever you desire. With the 40,000 iso you can take some great pictures in low light, it DOES NOT have a flash, you must buy an external flash for it, however you are not going to have awful results without one like you would with a budget crop sensor. 

It does not have 4k video, but I need it for photography not video. Yet a brand new iphone or Galaxy won't touch the 1080p video the 6d mark II puts out. 

DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD, the wireless connect is a headache so I ordered a usb cord and do it the old fashion way. The bluetooth is neat for viewing images on your phone instead of looking at a smaller 3' screen.

JCinBTV^/canon-eos-6d-mark-ii-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/5959400?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I just received my 6D II yesterday.  I am impressed, to say the least.  However, when I saw the thickness of the owner's manual I almost had heart failure!  It's over an inch thick!  But...it's in three languages so that explained a lot.  *Whew*  I immediately charged the battery and took some test shots.  Totally impressed.  The experts may not be too crazy about the 6D II but I am!  I upgraded from my trusty 40D and I am not sorry I did.  I use two L series lenses:  24-70 f/2.8 and a 70-200 f/2.8.  The 6D II will make those lenses shine even more.  

The attached images were taken with the 6D II with the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens-hand held with only available lighting.  Aperture priority setting and auto ISO.  RAW converted to .jpg with Photoshop Lightroom.  

TAKE NOTE!:  RAW images taken with cameras manufactured after 12/2017 are no longer compatible with most older Apps and/or programs.  My LR 4.0 could not read the RAW images taken by the 6D II.  You will/may need to upgrade.  I had to forsake my trusty LR 4.0 and became a paying member of Adobe's Creative Cloud family.  I chose to download just Lightroom.  $9.99/month plus applicable taxes.  There are some work-arounds but I chose to simply upgrade.

For some, not having 4K video may be an issue.  Did not matter to me as I seldom use video.

This WILL be a great upgrade to an enthusiast's full-frame.  I still have lots to read and learn about the 6D II so I just may be adding to this review.  Enjoy!!"^5^Oct 19, 2019 2:08 PM

trs0722^/nikon-d7500-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/5852906?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^43^3^"I picked up the D7500 over the weekend. I haven't put it through all of its paces yet. I may come back to update this later. But I figured I'd put some quick thoughts together for anyone on the fence. I've been using a D7100 for a few years and so far the D7500 is definitely worth the upgrade. I have already noticed a big difference in image quality and speed, things that are very important to me. I have not tested it with all my lenses and flash. The autofocus has been very good although it's not the same as with the D500. I have yet to test out running children/dogs in AF-C to see how the focus does. I also haven't done extensive low light testing but the few that I took around 800-1600 ISO looked really good. 

Some things you should be aware of...these are not necessarily 'cons' to me but they may be for you: 
1. Adobe and Apple have not released updates for this camera yet. Therefore, Photoshop and Lightroom will not import or process the files yet (JPG or RAW). Video files were recognized by my computer and LR5 though. There are workarounds via free software but it's more time consuming. These may be a disruption to your normal work flow as it has been to mine. Hopefully these updates will be out soon as they normally do. 
2. The top window is noticeably smaller than the D7xxx series. However, the shutter speed and aperture # are prominent and fairly big. The other info is squeezed closer together and a few things are missing (i.e. file type). But it's all there on the bigger info screen on the rear. 
3. You cannot put a battery grip on it. 
4. There is only one SD card slot. 
5. Battery life is supposed to be a little shorter than the D7100/7200.

But again there are some good pros:
1. Best crop frame sensor available now by Nikon
2. Noticeably lighter than the D7100/7200
3. Better in low light than D7100/7200
4. Touch screen functions
5. Can send pics via wi-fi to your phone. 

I've read a lot about the D500, which the D7500 is sort of the baby brother of. That thing is a beast that can compete with some of Nikon's full frame cameras. However, it's not for me and I suspect many other people: it is big, fairly heavy, and approaching the cost of a full frame camera. It also only has one SD slot (I don't use the other type it has) and doesn't have a built in flash. Yes, built in flash isn't always the best but I'd rather have it than not. For those of us not wanting or needing the D500 or an entry level FF, the D7500 is a no brainer. An alternative is to wait and see what Nikon does with the updates for the D750, D610, and D810, which may be coming soon. It's possible the cost of FF bodies will come down. However, I for one, am not ready for that leap yet and think the D7500 will serve me well for years to come. Hopefully, I don't eat these words once I put it through more testing as my workflow is restored."^5^Jun 19, 2017 9:45 PM

They are rich, vibrant, and professional; ergonomics are great. To date, I have only used it for sports photography, but it will be my primary camera from here on out.

I wanted to try Nikon so I purchased the D7500 at Best Buy. Overall, I think it's a great camera. I own the top of the line professional Pentax DSLR (the K-1)so I will not compare it with the mid-level Nikon D7500. But just looking and using this camera for what it is, it's pretty solid. I paired it with a Nikon 200-500mm VR lens. Yes ithe D7500 only has one SD card slot..so what. It's not a deal breaker, takes 10 secs to place a new SD card. So it has far less shots it can take with the fully charged En-EL15a battery than the Nikon D7200..solution: purchase a back-up battery. So it has only 20MP vs a Nikon D7200...who cares. End of the day, no one will notice it. Buy the Nikon D7500, you will love it."^5^Jul 4, 2017 6:51 PM

Upgraded from an entry-level Nikon DSLR which I found to be a nice camera, but I needed more speed to keep up with my sons' swimming. I considered the D500 for its speed (10 fps), but decided the D7500's speed (8 fps) was more than sufficient, and the price of the 7500 vs. the D500 couldn't be beat. Also, who doesn't like having the newest thing available?"^5^Jun 30, 2017 11:08 PM
trs0722^/nikon-d7500-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/5852906?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^11^3^"I bought this a week or two after it was released as an upgrade to my D7100. While the D7100 has been great, the D7500 is a very worthy upgrade. I considered the D500, the D750, and waiting for Nikon's new full frame releases but ultimately decided crop frame is still right for me at this point. The D7500 is basically the little brother of the D500, which (from what I've read) is incredible and bumped the D7200 as Nikon's new top crop frame camera. However for me, the D500 was too big, lacked a pop up flash, and was almost the same cost as some of their FF cameras. 

Pros:
1. New sensor (same as the D500). The colors and sharpness are excellent...noticeably better than my D7100. The noise and autofocus are considerably better too. There's also a new group focus point option and auto fine tune that I'm still experimenting with. 
2. Lighter and slightly smaller than the D7100. Much easier to carry around. 
3. It's FAST!....much faster than my D7100.
4. Rear touch screen that also tilts...comes in handy. Had that in my first DSLR (D5100) and it's nice having it back, especially for video. 
5. 4K video and wi-fi/bluetooth. Haven't taken full advantage of 4K video yet but even the 1080 looks better than my D7100. I can now upload pics if I want on the fly (takes a few steps but great option to have). To save battery I leave it on airplane mode until I want to upload. 

Cons:
The main con for me is that the D7500 only has one SD slot. I loved having an extra slot in the D7100...mostly only as a back up when I left my main one in my computer. I only used the 2nd slot during a shoot a few times in 3 years. So, now I have to be more aware of where my card is or keep extras in my bag or vehicle. I've seen complaints about this but many countered (and I agree) saying that 2nd slot rarely, if ever, 'saved' a shoot when the first card went bad. 

Others have complained that you cannot put a battery grip on it. This was not a big deal for me. Nikon also dropped the total megapixels and reduced the monitor resolution from the D7200 and D500. These changes will not even be noticeable to most users.

The last thing to consider is some editing programs (Lightroom and Photoshop in particular) have not added this camera profile to their software yet. Therefore, they will not recognize the NEF's or JPG's from this camera. This has been an inconvenience for me b/c to view and edit my photos, I've had to open the RAW files in Nikon Capture NXD (which is free), convert them to TIFFs, and then import into Lightroom where I can then work on the files. It usually takes Adobe some time (a month or two) to do this so I expect an update to be coming soon."^5^Jul 15, 2017 9:15 AM

RBrylawski^/nikon-d7500-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/5852906?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"I've been a Nikon shooter since before digital. Nothing in my humble opinion compares to Nikon. This camera replaced my Nikon D7100, which is still a very capable camera, but the D7500 is several steps ahead. With fewer (but larger pixels), this camera shoots with stunning clarity. It's faster with 8 FPS continuous and the inclusion of what makes the top end D500 such a great camera, is also shared with the D7500. I love how this camera weighs fractionally less than the D7100, but has a more weather sealed body and the inclusion of an articulated screen is a nice addition. This camera sacrifices one memory card slot, but with memory so inexpensive these days, a 128 GB card will hold more photos than I could possibly take at one time. It's also a great addition that this camera is fully Bluetooth and Wifi enabled and communicates easily to Nikon apps to quickly and seamlessly transfer your pictures to your mobile device.

This is a great addition to the Nikon lineup and is perfect for someone who is looking for something that will challenge their creative abilities more than the less expensive gear, but won't break the bank like their top end gear."^5^Dec 22, 2017 5:43 PM

Most of the criticism of this model is about Nikon dropping the dual card slots that the previous 7000 series models offered. (The D500 does have dual cards.) That is a complete non-issue to me, but your milage may vary. Also, although the sensor is the same as the D500 and so low light performance should be at the same excellent level, the focus system is not as advanced. It would have been considered state of the art until the latest models, and unless you are photographing fast moving subjects, I don't think you will find it lacks anything. I started taking pictures with film cameras with manual focus and light meters, so although the automatic modes are great for fast stuff, I still have no issues with focusing manually and consulting the light meter, and my experience, for the exposure. Overall, a wonderful camera and the latest of the Nikon 'enthusiast' lineup."^5^Jul 19, 2018 8:42 PM

I bought the body only, since I have a number of Nikon lenses from the past, including 3 that I used with my Nikon 8008 film camera back in the early '90's (35, 50 and 70-200).  The D40x couldn't autofocus with those, but now they're fully usable again.  I'm not finding the absence of vibration reduction to be a big problem at the moment, but will probably pick up an 18-300 with it in the future.

I'm very impressed with the size and feel of this camera.  Coming from a tiny D40x, I was concerned that it would seem oversized and heavy.  But that's not the case at all.  It's very comfortable in hand, and light.    

I'm still in my learning curve, as this camera has significantly more capability than my previous. 

I'm rating it as an excellent value, as I was able to purchase it during a sale with a significant discount, and it was certainly time for me to upgrade.  At full list, I probably wouldn't even have considered it, since I take most of my daily photos with my smartphone now, and I haven't been doing that much with my D40x.

The D500 sensor on it makes for some incredible low light photos and in really bright settings it works even better. Also the larger sensor makes up for the 14% loss in mega pixels but if you invest in good glass (as you should with any camera) then you'll be fine. The only draw back is the one slot memory cards. Other than that this camera shoots faster than the 7200 and can shoot brighter and more colorful photos than the 7200."^4^Jun 12, 2018 10:59 AM

The negatives most commonly cited (single card slot & no vertical grip) were not issues for me. Also, considered the d7200 but the D7500 just felt more comfortable in my hands (the deeper grip is really nice) and handling it felt more 'natural' for me. I have tested the camera's iso-performance up to 12,800 in indoor lighting at some events and have been very pleased with the JPEGs rendered (haven't tested RAW yet) - compared to my D5500 (which already performs well in low-light), I seem to be getting 1 or 2 stops of additional ISO performance to get images of comparable noise & 'quality' (just my unscientific observations). If you're looking to upgrade from a d3xxx or d5xxx series, it'll definitely be worth it. If you already have a d7200, I'm honestly not sure - there are enough professional reviews out there that comment on this topic so my opinion wouldn't be worth much. If you want a D500 but can't justify the cost, I think the D7500 would be a satisfying compromise."^5^Aug 26, 2017 5:39 PM

BMunster^/nikon-d7500-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/5852906?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I think the D7500 by Nikon is the perfect happy medium. I'm an amateur photographer...definitely not a pro. I like a camera that has great image quality, but doesn't break the bank, and isn't super heavy or large to carry on a long hike. On the other hand, I like to have some flexibility with lenses, etc.

I paired this with the Nikon 10-20mm wide angle lens (great for real estate photos) as well as the 18-400mm zoom lens by Tamron. Both lenses were on sale @ Best Buy, and I paid $899 for the D7500 body. The 18-400 is waterproof and dust proof, just like this D7500 body. That makes it great as an outdoors camera, and I do a lot of biking and biking, so it seemed the perfect match for me (being lightweight and somewhat compact).

I upgraded from a Nikon D3400 entry level camera since the lenses I had would be interchangeable. While the D3400 had a higher resolution, the D7500 shots I've taken are so much crisper and have a much great depth of field. I still haven't learned about all the bells and whistles yet but paired with a good lens (Tamron 18-400mm) I feel like I could eventually take professional looking pix at an enthusiast price. I was thinking of the D500 too but it was more camera than I needed. (I'm not a professional/wanna be.) I needed something that would help me take better photos of birds/wildlife, the D7500 does that and more. A couple of down sides: the flash sometimes is annoying when in auto and the weight especially with a telephoto lens is more than I was used to with the really light D3400. I would also not upgrade to this camera if I had the D7200. 
I'm really glad I upgraded because the fast shutter speed, the 10 fps and the great and quick auto focus all make the D7500 a best buy."^5^Jan 12, 2019 7:10 AM

Many people recommended I go with a more simple camera like the canon rebel, but like many people I didnt want to be limited with what I could do down the road. The D7500 shoots amazing pictures, has a user friendly interface, and is a blast to use. it shoots amazing photos at higher iso than similar cameras in its price range. I was worried that the slightly lower megapixels than some similar cameras might make for less quality pictures, but I was pleasantly surprised with how wonderful the pictures turned out. I am still working through some basic concepts of photography, but have already been able to take nice photos because of this cameras shutter speed.

The settings are easy to understand, and you can see the settings on the LDC screen. Speaking of the LCD screen, it's nice feature is being able to flip out, around and upside down. Basically can be at any angle (to allow you to take pictures behind that giant of a man standing in front of you). 
But the best feature has to be the Snapbridge. This allows you to link your phone to the camera via bluetooth. As you take that perfect picture with your camera, it'll sync up with your phone moments later. You can then immediately post that perfect picture on your favorite social media. 
My only complaint is that snapbridge is a bit finicky. It's saying it won't connect, then moments later it's connected. Can't figure out when or why. Otherwise, it's a great camera that takes incredible pictures.

However, I searched for a nice DSLR to use with a macro lense and ring flash for some clinical (medical) photography for our office. I looked at several options, Nikon and other brands. Relative to the size, weight, features, and basic cost, this camera fit our needs the best. Yes, Canon has some wonderful products, but since we already used a Nikon at the other office, this fit our needs well. We like the auto-focus feature and ability to see the shot on the LCD screen prior to taking it. That last statement was probably preposterous to many reading this, but these features have been noted to be useful by the staff!"^5^Oct 20, 2018 12:36 PM

The D5600 takes good still shots, but when it comes to video, it's a flop.

I am just starting photography but believe in the saying you get what you pay for. I bypassed the entry level cameras and jump into pro consumer class, knowing it has the features I need to control the pictures I take. That said, with all the reviews out there, the canon 80d has everything one would need to learn how to take great pictures without breaking the bank. This is my first step, and moving forward, will invest in good to great canon lenses. For starters, upgrade the starter lens for a prime,lens.
And if the ergonomics don't fit, install a battery grip. The one for the 70d fits. 
Even for starters, the pictures taken with just setting it to auto are awesome! And don't compare photos with it against an iPhone , it ain't even close. Comparing it to a Nikon, Pentax or Sony aps-c equivalent DSLR would be an even playing ground. I personally like the pictures taken from the 80d versus Nikon d7200. For my eyes, the color and body of the images taken from the 80d has more color rendition and depth.

Our old camera didn't allow you to see your pictures being taken on the LCD, but only through the viewfinder. The combination of that and screen being touch is also huge for photo composition. Being able to change exposure on the touch screen has allowed us to capture photos we wouldn't have been able to with our past cameras.

The built-in wi-fi is great as well for sending photos from camera to phone on car rides home -- saves some time processing, as well as gives the ability to share high quality photos to social networks in a timely fashion.

Going from a crop sensor to a full frame has been a wonderful discovery.

The mirrorless looks cool and promising, but the bodies are smaller and not easy to hold. The Canon 6D MII feels good in my hand, easy to hold, easy to shoot just like my D80. My only concern is the kit lens, the 24-105 f/3.5-6.3. I know there are other options, and I would have preferred the 24-70 f/4, or the 24-105 f/4 L as kit lens options.

Not being ready to go mirrorless or full-frame and no reason to switch systems (have always used Canon gear), sticking with latest version in the line made sense. Handling is virtually identical (but feels more solid and smooth) with a couple controls moved and added, so the transition was easy. A minor thing, but the shutter/mirror mechanism seems quieter and more 'substantial' sounding. With the 33 megapixel sensor (vs 18MP in the 60D), image quality is a very noticeable step up (as are the file sizes). Much higher frame rate (10 fps) is nice to have available.  I don't shoot much video but the 90D offers a lot more flexibility for that when I might need it.

I have a mixed feeling about it perhaps I was new at this camera.  It said this camera is capable 10 frames per second, but compare to the 7D mark ii it seems to be slower than the 7D mark ii, but the 32.5MP images are far better than my old 7D mark ii

The most advantage of thi EOS 90D is LCD touchscreen features a vari-angle design allow me freely to manuveur it in the position I wanted.

At 100% (normal) magnification, the noise difference is perceptible but doesnt distract from the overall image quality, making the 90D a good camera at the price point for the casual photographer.  I personally like the color saturation of the 7D MK-II but thats a personal choice and easily adjusted in PS on 90D images.  Bells and whistles the 90D has it all over the 7D MK-II.  Conclusion: for the Professional the 7D MK-II wins hands down.  For the amateur or aspiring Pro the 90D is a good entry point.  In retrospect, were money not an issue when I got into digital, full-frame is the way to go and despite its age my choice would be the Canon EOS 5D MK-IV, but my lens investment keeps me with Canon APSC sensor EOS-S lens mount systems.  I tried adaptors but constant lens focal ratcheting, even when not actively focusing, proved a disqualifier.  The GOOD rating is a little generous because of the noise issue, which for me is a BIG issue in my photography"^4^Nov 24, 2019 12:37 PM

I like and have enjoyed this camera, the reason for 4 stars is the wifi feature. If they just left it off and included IR remote shoot I would rate it 5 stars. 
Pros:
I wanted a camera easier to use with manual mode, this works. The command diel on the top of the camera is easy to use. 

The large screen makes it easy to review shoots for sharpness, composure and make sure you have the shoot you want. If you do not want the screen to illuminate, leave it reversed. The touch screen makes it easy and faster to change settings and mode.

Pictures are very sharp, good contrast and color saturation. 
The size and weight of this model works for me. Lighter and smaller than most. 

Auto focus is fast and accurate, but may vary with lens. 

I like the live view better than I thought I would. I find situations where you cannot frame a shoot otherwise. It is good for close ups of flowers where you need to be low to the ground. 

Cons:

Not impressed with the wifi features and the fact they choose to leave off the IR remote shoot. Im just going to bundle all of the wifi features into one and say, Nikon could have invested there time and money in a better way."^4^Jul 18, 2017 9:29 AM

Remy^/nikon-d5600-dslr-camera-body-only-black/5715100?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"I understand that this isn't a full frame camera, which is most coveted by a professional, but this camera has proven to be not just an immense upgrade from my D5300 but a solid choice for anyone looking to up their photography from a cell phone or lower level camera.

This 24MP sensor is still as sharp and clean as ever, especially without the anti-aliasing filter (also known as a low pass filter) on it. That filter is meant to take out moire but at this resolution, it's absolutely not needed and the improvement is clear. Cropping down and sharing to any social media shows no real degradation of quality so if your shot is slightly off and you need to straighten or crop in, you have room to do so.

Burst shooting is immensely improved compared to my old D5300 with what feels like a faster burst rate and a far larger buffer, allowing for more shots to be taken in succession. The readiness of live view is also a MASSIVE improvement, going from shot to shot. In the D5300, if you take a shot in live view, it'd take a good 4-5 seconds before it's ready for another shot. Now, it's more like 1-2 seconds. In comparison, it feels instantaneous. I prefer using the optical view finder, but those low shots are very easy to get to with the flip out screen and live view activated.

As of 11/9/2018, the SnapBridge app is immensely approved compared to previous utilities. Once tethered via Bluetooth, and/or Wi-Fi, it also automatically geo-tags pictures as you shoot. It can also move over full size JPEGs and not just 1.2MP versions of the shots you take. RAW transfer to a phone or iPad will require a physical connection. Good news is that it now uses micro USB vs. a proprietary connector!

The grip is deep and easy to handle, the touch screen is responsive and bright, battery life leaves nothing to be desired but I do recommend you only get extra batteries by Nikon ONLY, no third parties. Bonus: the touch screen can be used to select your focus point when you're shooting in single point AF mode.

In all, it's a great value and there should be no hesitation in purchasing. If you're getting this from scratch, get the package with the 18-140mm lens and the Nikon 35mm f1.8 lens to get yourself started. Best investment you can take to take your photography to the next level."^5^Nov 9, 2018 12:01 PM
Chuckybear^/nikon-d5600-dslr-camera-body-only-black/5715100?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"I upgraded from my D3200 to this camera, and I can't begin to tell you happy I am with that decision. I looked at other models (I like Nikon), I decided on the D5600, wow, what a difference. I also like that I can connect with the Snapbridge app and view my pictures right on my phone. I don't get into the social media frenzy, but I do enjoy sending the pictures to my family and friends and the app allows me to do this.

Enough about the app, the picture quality with this camera is not even comparable, Though I am not a professional photographer, the picture's I am able to take now look like professional quality."^5^Jun 2, 2018 7:31 AM

The camera is easy to operate, but it does have a learning curve if you are new to DSLR cameras. The camera is definitely worth checking out! However, beware of the Rode Go mic included in the bundle because it is defective. Rode is aware of this problem, but they aren't doing much to fix it. The microphone is notoriously known for picking up lots of interference from Wi-Fi. So, if you plan on using it near any device that uses WiFi then tough luck because you are going to get video footage that is unusable! The Rode Go will pick up interference which sounds like a thumping/clinking sound and is nearly impossible to get rid of this in post-production. Depending on where you live, you might have to pay a restocking fee to return the bundle. Therefore, just save yourself from this and buy something else. There are solutions to fixing the mic's defect, but why go though the trouble to fix it when you can get something that will work perfectly fine from the start.

I am struggling with the video in terms of keeping focus on a moving object but I am thinking that it's just a matter of learning the camera and it's focus features. Bestbuy did a great job at the time with a few bonus extras and I also get the $ back in points so they were the best choice for me. I suggest buying the camera from a good known source such as BB as I hear lots of nightmares buying unknowably international versions for less in the US at other online retailers.

From build specs to image quality, there are incredibly few cameras that can beat it especially at this price point. I've had it for approximately three days now, and this is my real world review.

Before I start my review, I would to point out if one is going to shell out over $2,000 for a camera, one should be aware that this not a camera for beginner photographers. Yes, there is an auto mode and other scene modes. Yes, it is a professional camera built into a semi-pro body. But to bring out the full potential and appreciate the depth of this camera, one should have an in depth knowledge of photography. With that said, here begins my review.

Build/Handling:

The Nikon D750 is a sturdily built with a mixture of carbon fiber and magnesium alloy. Carbon fiber is an incredibly strong material and will not yield unless put underneath incredible pressure. Rest assured knowing the camera body will not crack if you accidentally bump a wall with it. The articulating screen is also well protected and for people worried about the cable breaking with the screen out, Nikon has taken special steps to ensure it will not unless one physically reaches in and tears it out. The handgrip is nice and deep, and should fit for the bill for the majority of users. Weight wise, it is very light, but the 24-120mm lens is not. Know that if one attaches this lens to the body or other heavier pro grade glass, the camera will tilt forward. Weather sealing is admirable on this camera, and a light mist or deep cold will not affect it, but try to keep out of potential downpours. There are reviews stating this camera could go out through a hurricane and survive. Maybe it will, but why take the risk? Also, the Nikon warranty will not cover rain damage.

Image Quality:

Absolutely stunning. Even when shooting up to 12,000 ISO images were clear and crisp in both JPEG and RAW format. To get the best out this camera, I would highly recommend shooting in RAW and using Lightroom or Adobe Photoshop for post processing. Colors are accurate and spot on. With good glass, one will never be disappointed. I was shooting downtown in some pretty poor lighting, but this camera kept up to the task especially after post processing the images. Even in bright sunlight, it was very difficult to take a photo and have it be overexposed.

Is this the camera for you?

I'd write about about buffer speeds, handling, video quality, etc, but there are scores of reviews for this camera online written by photographers who have had years more of photography experience than myself (and I have a decade). This camera is excellent for all fields of photography. It is a full frame camera, and yes one will get higher quality images than an APS-C camera if the photographer knows what he or she is doing (hence not a beginner's camera). If one is willing to pay the extra money, go for it. This camera is worth every penny."^5^Mar 7, 2016 1:29 PM

The high ISO performance on this camera is insanely good. I have no issues pushing this thing to ISO 12,800 when needed. The 51 autofocus points are dead on and I don't find myself needing to use the center focus point and then recompose to get sharp images. The surrounding focus points are dead on even in dark situations.

I've used the Canon MK III's extensively and the auto focus performance on any Canon, in my experience, is nowhere near as fast and precise as the D750. 

I shoot events as well as my kids (who are 7 and 10) and the 6.5 fps burst mode is more than enough to capture a cool sequence of movement. It's a little bit of spraying and praying but can provide a cool 3 or 4 photo sequence print that would look great on a wall. 

The HD video on D750 is tack sharp, clean and beautiful for your everyday family moments and gatherings. If you're a weekend wedding warrior this camera will definitely provide great looking footage, however, I must admit that the ISO performance on the Canon 5D MKIII's is far superior to the Nikon's. So, depending on your primary use you may want to consider the Canon 5D MKIII. 

Nikon's ISO performance has always been superior to Canon's on the still image side. Canon, however, always out performed Nikon's ISO performance on the video front. So, really, consider what your primary use for the camera will be and go from there."^5^Jun 22, 2016 5:17 PM

I am amazed with the performance of the camera body as well as the lens that came with it. I had been borrowing my parents camera for a few years, a Nikon D3000. I did a lot of research after saving enough money to purchase my own camera, and decided the Nikon D750 would be a good fit for me. I do mostly portrait work, including seniors, children, and families.
 
The Nikon D750 has been a dream to work with thus far. A few of the features I enjoy the most are the double memory card slots, battery life, and accessibility options.
 
Memory Card Slots:
Upgrading from a D3000 is a HUGE step. You now have capability to use 2 memory cards at the same time. This is perfect for days that you are shooting more than one family, a wedding, large events, whatever it may be. Worrying about switching memory cards is not a concern while using this camera, which resolves stress.
 
Battery Life:
The battery is also very impressive. When purchasing the bundle from Best Buy, a spare battery is included. This is a nice bonus, especially since both of the batteries are very long lasting. I have shot multiple sessions in one day with the use of only one battery; at the end of the day the battery still had life left. 
 
Accessibility Options:
One of my favorite features of this camera body is the ability to switch settings with ease. Photographers are always focusing on what is in the frame and it is helpful to be able to adjust settings quickly. The settings are customizable and easy to adjust, even while shooting. 

The Nikon D750 is a great investment for photographers. The price may seem high if you are a first time photography equipment purchaser, but this really is a great deal. If you are looking for a camera to take your images to the next level, this is a great buy for you. Overall, the camera performs very well and I am more than pleased with my purchase!"^5^Feb 9, 2017 9:50 PM

I got this camera to replace a D700 which has been an excellent camera that I have used for the last five years. However, after using my first D750 for the past year, I was convinced to upgrade my D700 to a D750. The auto focus system, high ISO picture quality, increased resolution, and lighter weight of the D750 were the main reasons for upgrading. The increased resolution allows me to crop photos more to achieve better composition, and the quality of the files allows much more manipulation in post processing of the raw files. Another important feature of the D750 is that it has two memory card slots which enables me to record two copies of my photos for important shoots such as weddings to prevent lost picture files. Make sure to use the best lenses possible to get the most out of this great camera."^5^Jun 24, 2016 10:51 PM

Nice balance between cost/price and features. Offers many of the features of the higher-end D810, but at a price point between the D610 and D810. I would recommend this for intermediate-advanced photographers (although it is easy enough to figure out for a novice after reading the manual all the way through and finding where everything is). Kit lens (24-120mm) is OK. Not the best, but not the worst either. Get this kit, and a nice 50mm prime, and you're pretty much set. Maybe a longer-zoom lens like a 70-300mm to add to your camera bag, and you pretty much have all major focal lengths covered. Camera is a bit heavy (heavier than the D3000/5000-series. I have smaller hands, but this still feels comfortable (D800-series is just too heavy for me, and too much money). Excellent low-light performance. Only issue I run into every once in a while is that shutter tops out at 1/4000 second, but this maybe a handful of times per year out of several hundred shots per month. If you're considering the D610, get this instead. newer technology for a little more. Unless you're a pro, I'd not consider the D810 unless you can justify the extra $1000 price tag. The D750 hits a nice sweet spot for most people (pro and hobby) at this price point."^5^Jan 13, 2016 12:13 AM

I shoot manual 100% of the time and highly recommend it but the rest of my family doesn't. I chose that option so others could borrow my camera or for the odd time when there simply isn't enough time to get the perfect settings before the photo opportunity passes. To be completely honest, it does take a bit of time to learn the entire camera. I'm a nerd, and read every manual cover to cover, and was still a bit confused on some of the menu choices. No worries though. There are plenty of videos out there on YouTube to help. I recommend Jared Polin with Froknowsphoto. I primarily shoot this camera while scuba diving using the Nauticam housing. I'm shooting in low light situations or even in the dark if wreck or night diving. It performs wonderfully in these conditions with dual underwater Sea and Sea YS-D2 strobes. I'm especially enjoying the exposure metering! It's not always spot on, but it gives you a very close place to start.

I will start by saying that the gentleman at the Florence, Ky Best Buy store did satisfactorily resolve the problem, by replacing the camera and adjusting the charge for 3 year Geek a Squad protection. But I have great concern with the warranty service provided by Best Buy.
I am not a novice with a camera, and have always taken extreme caution and excellent care of my cameras for more than forty years. I have always used Minolta and Sony, and continue to use them today. I purchased the Nikon 750 in October, 2015, and noticed the 'burn-in' in the viewfinder in September, 2016. I returned the Nikon D750 to Best Buy, Fields Ertel location in Cincinnati, Ohio, in the original box with all of the original packaging, to be sent out for repair (I do not know if it was sent to an authorized Nikon repair facility or was examined by the Geek squad). After approximately 10 days, I was notified that the camera was approved for replacement, due to 'impact damage', which is not covered by the manufacturers warranty, but WAS covered by the Geek Squad warranty, which would replace the camera. The problem???? The camera was never dropped, mishandled, and was in perfect condition when I turned it in for repair. I am upset that I now be would be responsible for purchasing another warranty for the replacement camera at a cost of 299.00!!! My concern is that I have no recourse, as the camera was not returned to Best Buy, and I have no validation of the stated impact damage. I feel that the 'impact damage' statement is simply to void the manufacturers warranty. As I earlier stated, the Florence, Ky Best Buy store did adjust the warranty price (there has been a price drop of 200.00 on the camera since I originally purchased 11 months ago), but I have significant reservations towards any major future purchases with Best Buy due to this incident.. Lastly, each email update that I received from the Geek Squad lists the phone number 1-800-433-5778, available '24/7', for questions, etc concerning the repair. I attempted to call to obtain information, however, the hours for this service are 7am to 11pm, NOT 24/7 as stated."^3^Oct 6, 2016 3:38 AM

This is not a starter camera, but if you ready to get past the entry level cameras, this is just a masterpiece for the price. This camera makes about 20-30 MB RAW files and 8-20 MP JPEG files.

It is sharp, and focus is almost instant, paired with the fast continuous focus tracking of the d750 and you got a strong fast motion capturing camera. Bokeh looks great at f4 and even better with faster lenses.The zoom range of the lens is perfect for everyday shooting from portraits to outdoor landscapes, to indoor low light with the powerful full frame sensor. Video recording is great as well. Tilting screen is very useful for getting all different angles of shooting and the display is sharp too. Double memory card slots is very useful as well.

For me it focuses on my desired subject through gaps in railings and tree branches surprisingly well. 
The only feature I wish it has is the little joystick at the back of my D500 cameras. Once you've used one you easily notice its absence. I added the battery grip and now it is about as good as it gets for a full frame DSLR at an attainable price.

I say entry level because using the standard lens at the 24mm setting, your picture will quickly pixelate. This camera does better at zoom because there are only 24M pixels and you have to think about what your optics are going to put on the FX sensor. If you can focus on what you want(e.g. zoom) then the picture result will be excellent. If you try to take a wide angle picture and crop an area of interest, you may be disappointed. I was most happy shooting near or at 120mm with the supplied lens and found the pictures to be excellent. It's not a camera to carry to a party as it is heavy. If you want to learn about photography, then this camera will be great for you. It's intuitive and easy to use."^5^Sep 20, 2017 6:06 PM

The obvious reason for buying this camera is the full frame sensor, but what I really like is that the body is only a littler larger than the D7000. I know some people think more, bigger hardware makes for a more professional appearance, but one of the main reasons it took me so long in life to get into DSLR cameras is the sheer bulk of the hardware. The D750 is the smallest of Nikon's full frame cameras, and I like that.

Aside from that, the camera operates much like my D7000, which is nice because it was a very easy transition, I didn't have to spend weeks learning to use the camera. Of course, there are many additional features, some I will use, many I will not. The fact is, most modern higher-end DSLRs have feature-itis, and I suppose some people like that.

At the end of the day, this camera does everything I want and so much more, but above all it takes fantastic photographs. I can see the superior low-light capabilities of the full frame sensor in my images, and that is ultimately why I made the leap from the D7000. This is a great camera."^5^Jul 25, 2016 7:30 PM

At least the images are sharp, and there are tons of features (though I'll probably never use 80% of them, it's cool that they're there in case I do need them).

If you're upgrading from a DX camera to FX, be aware that there is a significant size and weight upgrade as well, and larger images mean you'll need larger SD cards in order to be able to take the same number of pictures per card.

It was recently damaged beyond repair so I had to decide if I wanted to buy another D750 or upgrade to a D810. I decided to stay with the D750 since it is lighter and the 24MP sensor has plenty of resolution to fully leverage even professional lenses. The D750 and D810 share the same autofocus system and the D810 is considerably heaver and is about $1000 more expensive. I've been very happy with the D750.

-I wanted a shutter speed that can go up to 1/8000

-100% coverage in the viewfinder rather than the 95% I had. The view finder is also brighter and clearer due to the pentaprism.

-More manual controls.

I wanted something that felt closer to what the professionals use without breaking the bank. This camera is really built well, and can really deliver image quality.

I own the Canon SL1 which is a great camera, however switching lenses for wedding shoots or capturing moments on the fly is nerve wrecking. So I decided to get another camera. After researching I found the 80D to have superior video qualities than alot of the other choices, dozens of focusing point to select and many other options. The 80D is just wonderful and excellent camera body to have. I have recorded video and its stunning. The megapixel increase above Canon SL1 and Rebel is obvious when looking at pics. For photos I used the 24mm f/1.4L USM Wide angle and 100mm f/2.8L macro IS USM . Excellent photos. Antiflickering in the body is nice for photos. Slight increase in the creamery of boekh (blurring background). 

For Videos I use Canon - EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM , this is by far the best lens I have ever used for videos. STM and USM is technogy that suppose to limit the noise and help with faster autofocus. I many lenses with this this technology and the lenses still make noise. This lens make no noise. Meaning you hear no focusing noise in video playback. If you dont have this lens i suggest you get 1. Video features in the 80 D are wonderful."^5^Jul 2, 2016 12:20 PM

While the crop sensor may not be ideal for future photography projects, I plan on compensating with a 35mm lens.

After looking at reviews, I decided that this was the best all around camera for the money. I'd say it's geared more towards video, but the 24mp sensor is still giving you great quality pics. If you're looking to upgrade to a mid-tier DSLR I'd definitely go with the 80D. It's a great camera for Vlogging or just taking video in general. My favorite video feature is the touch display focus. You can touch any part of the display and the camera will focus on that section. Another great thing I love about this camera is the WiFi capability. I use this a lot, coupled with the Lightroom and Canon apps on my iPhone. This allows me to edit photos on the fly and upload them to social media or whatever platform I need.

Pros: it is fast, shutter speed is really great, little lag, in sun picture quality is excellent, video is fantastic
Cons: I still feel some issues with quality with low shutter speed on auto settings and some manual. I am pretty savvy and have a film degree so not stupid to cameras. Pretty well versed. Still figuring this out, but most shots are worth it.

YOu need a great lens with this, i use the 55-250mm cannon most of the time. Overall great camera, upgraded from T2i and previous 20D. But the $1199 felt like a little much for what i got. $999 would have felt more worth it.

I have to return it though as too many times with the battery in the camera would just freeze. I would turn off and it still would be frozen on, until I took the camera battery out.

I travel for a living so I always have the camera engaged in my travels; both business and personally.

I have a Canon 6D Mark ll body and a Canon 5d Mark iV body. Both are stunning cameras but heavy.

Along comes Canon's SL3. Still a SLR but at a fraction of the price. Made of plastic. Made in Taiwan. Lightweight (sometimes even cheap). I disliked Canon's SL1 and SL2 models so I'm very impressed that their SL3 is such a performer.

SPECS can be found on Canon's website if you're looking for details. However, I first want to add that this camera has Canon's fast-performance DIGIC 8 processor. For reasons unknown, Canon introduced the DIGIC 8 on the SL3. It's a 2019 processor of high speed and amazing performance. Expect no shutter lag, no lighting issues and when paired with a good-quality SD card (I use 300MB SD cards from SanDisk), the camera does everything you could expect of a $1500-$2500 body for basic shooting.

It's underpriced. It's a value for certain.

What I do dislike about it is the inferior lens that comes with the camera when you buy the KIT VERSION. It's a plastic, cheaply designed and low performance starter lens. It is a EF-S lens but the SL3 will take both EF and EF-S lenses. Thankfully I have many EF L-Series lenses and it's a much better camera when using a quality lens.

Very impressive SLR from Canon."^4^May 10, 2019 4:08 PM
Greauxe^/canon-eos-rebel-sl3-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-55mm-is-stm-lens/6346261?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"This tiny DSLR is just a little chunkier than a small mirrorless camera and gives some unique alternatives. You can shoot it as a DSLR with a nice, clear optical viewfinder with 9 focusing points or you can shoot it as a 'mirrorless' camera using the back screen which gives you many more focus point, eye AF and Canon's legendary Dual Pixel Auto Focus that smoothly acquires focus without hunting back and forth. For video people, you can clean HDMI output to an external recorder and get 4:2:2 10 bit at 4k! The new Canon 90D doesn't have this feature according to the specs. The battery life is unbelievably good and will outlast ANY mirrorless camera by far. THE BAD: 4K looks great but is not very flexible in as much as you have only 23.98P and no DPAF! Rolling shutter is pretty bad in 4K. Also, 4K has an additional crop so you'll really need a wide lens for it to be useable. This camera has two levels of electronic image stabilization which works with Canon's optically stabilized lens but crops your video further still! The sensor is really clean and almost free of noise at 6400 ISO and is very useable up to 12,800 with level one high ISO noise reduction turned on. I didn't see any improvement from 1,2, or 3 in terms of in-camera NR. The SL3 has a setting that makes the camera take 4 photos every time you press the shutter which it samples and then produces a single noise-free The creative filters are actually really handy and in some cases can provide a more interesting photo than even the most experienced photographer could take.  It has focus-peaking for manual focus or focus-pulling and the autofocus on the back screen does an incredible job following faces or whatever your subject is, keeping them in focus."^5^Aug 30, 2019 4:08 PM
TugboatWilly^/canon-eos-rebel-sl3-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-55mm-is-stm-lens/6346261?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"Ive been getting by with  the top shelf point and shoot cameras since finally(almost permanently) stepping away from my beloved 35mm.  Ive taken some wonderful pictures with those cameras and will always keep one for the sheer convenience.  It has to be said though, that these cameras will always be limited by their lenses or rather their lack of options.  That was my main reason for stepping back into the SLR realm.

I chose the SL3 because it looked to be a good step as a DSLR while maintaining many of the features Ive become comfortable with in the point and shoots.  I had a done a lot of research on it predecessor the SL2 and went to look at it and was told that the SL3 had just been released so I snatched one up.  Its very easy to use and will actually tutor you as you use it.  Gives helpful suggestions but you can turn those off if youd rather not.  Has a good Auto focus and in the full automatic setting it is consistent.  

I would recommend not buying the kit with the 18/55 mm lens.  Buy the body and go an extra few hundred bucks for a better lens.  The kit lens feels cheap but does an adequate job.  Its very plastic.

All in all, its a good buy and easy, step into DSLRs.  Priced under 600.00, its hard to beat and Canon packed all of its latest and greatest features into it."^4^Jul 20, 2019 8:21 PM

This is the first one I have ever not liked 'out of the box.' It is difficult to use the camera in shutter priority or aperture priority because you have to figure our how to find the right display mode first. There is no place on the top of the camera for a no flash setting. Apparently you can't have 'no flash' in the automatic setting. The guide that comes with the book is pretty useless and the advanced user guide that you can download is 500 pages.  In the automatic mode it took all pictures at f stop 4.5 or 5 so there was very little depth of field."^3^Jul 17, 2019 5:40 PM
tower41photography^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^131^10^"This is the fifth Nikon DSLR that I've had, (D40X, D200, D300, D300s, and now the D750). I've been waiting for years for Nikon to produce an upgrade to my now 5 year old beloved D300s. As a professional photographer, it was really important that my next camera met my strict set of needs and wants. Sure, Nikon produced the D7000 series, but that took a professional camera and dumbed it down. While the D800/810 are almost unanimously the best out there, I can't shoot a wedding with 36MP photos. I don't even want to think about how many memory cards I'd need to shoot the 1-2000 RAW photos taken at an average wedding. The D4S is lovely, but I can't quite justify paying that much for a camera. The D600 was a bit plagued, and after shooting with a rental D610 I was left with lots of frustration and questionable images. The D610 had some weird white balancing and exposure issues. Also, for my large hands the grip felt incredibly cramped, which is a big deal breaker when this camera is going to be attached to my arm for 12 hours a day. Could Nikon not produce a proper successor to the D300s/D700 in 5 years?

Luckily, the D750 really seems to be that camera.
-The grip, while as narrow as the D610, is much deeper, which makes all of the difference in the work.
-Focus is incredibly fast and accurate, even in really low light settings.
-Photos are crisp and full of detail (even with the AA filter).
-The rotating screen, while built very solidly built does scare me a little, so I'll use that sparingly. It's bright, and the addition of white (as well as RGB LEDs) really bumps up the readability. The screen isn't quite as nice as a retina display, but it's not far off.
-The top screen (while much smaller than the D300s) is bolder and easier to read.
-Speaking of easier to read...the viewfinder display is unreal! It's white and bright and an upgrade that I love but I didn't even think about.
-Controls and menus are a bit frustrating. Had an issue with autofocus trying to focus before every picture in a burst and it took quite about 30 minutes on the phone with Nikon to figure out what was causing the issue. It was a stupidly simple fix. Once I figure out this camera and get used to the slightly different button order, it'll be fine.
-Speaking of burst, 6.5 fps may not be the fastest out there, but it is plenty fast for me. A little sad that the addition of the grip doesn't add an extra fps or two.
-Shutter sound on normal continuous high is actually quieter than the quiet mode on the D300s; a huge plus for me.
-Wireless capability. I'm not going to lie, this was a HUGE draw for me. I've used EyeFi cards, and they've been great, but their range was about 5 feet and the connection took quite a bit of time. The Nikon built in WiFi is fast and was able to trigger the camera from my phone from 25 feet away. Brilliant.
-And I saved the best to last. The low light performance of this camera is unlike anything I've ever seen. I think it may even be better than the D800. Completely usable photos up to 6400 ISO, and I wouldn't hesitate using a 51,200 ISO photo in a pinch. They were surprisingly low noise. Honestly, the 51,200 looked cleaner than a 6400 photo on the D300s

And now the negatives.
-First is the biggest one. The buffer. It's just ok. I could shoot burst mode for days with the D300s but the D750 only allows for a few seconds. I wish that it had the same buffer as the D810.
-Screen is a little bit slow to wake up when turned on with MENU or PLAY, etc.
-Camera is a bit too small for my hands, not unreasonably so, but I'll definitely be purchasing the grip soon.
-WiFi is unsecured?!? A big oversight for Nikon, which should (hopefully) be corrected with a firmware upgrade soon.
-No screen protector? This is the first Nikon that I got that didn't come with one. Even though it has the tabs to attach it, Nikon doesn't currently have a screen protector for the D750 (I spoke to Nikon customer service) I'm sure this problem will also be corrected soon, but these are the problems that you get when you get one of the first cameras off the line.
-Why does it have the spin dial controls at the top instead of the 3-4 button controls of the D800/810/D4s?
-The photos are too.... beautiful?

Honestly, try as I might, I couldn't come up with more than those slight complaints. Sorry this review was a bit long, but I am psyched about this camera, and thought it was deserving of a full review."^5^Oct 4, 2014 7:42 AM
mago^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^38^2^"I have been shooting Nikon cameras since 1989. My last camera was the D300. I wanted to have a camera capable to shoot clean shots at high ISO, with better auto-focus and with more resolution than the D300. The DX option was the D7100, but even though this is a very good camera, I was waiting for another DX equal enough to the D300 or much better in all respect. Obviously, the D7100 was tempting me but I was waiting for the rumored D400 that probably will never be created.
The D600 was not an option due to the oil getting in the sensor. Nikon tried to fix the problem by introducing the D610 which in my opinion, was not either an acceptable option as well. The D800 / 810 were too pricey and the D4, way too expensive for my wallet. I was waiting for either the rumored D7100 replacement or another camera FX in between the D610 and the D800 series when the D750 showed up !
I decided to buy this camera and move to a different world, the FX world, which demand the use of better lenses and technique. I do have 3 professional lenses already : Nikon 70-200 f/4, Nikon 105 f/2.8 and Nikon 16-35 f/4. The experience and technique was there also. I was ready to move and gave this camera a shot and let me tell you, I won't go back to any other; I am simply impress with this camera. I am able to shoot at ISO 12800 and the results are amazing, great colors at that high ISO and clean shots. The AF system of this camera is super fast and infallible. Set it up for AF-C Group and the camera will not stop shooting very sharp pics of your model regardless of their movement speed. This is a plus to me because I shoot weddings and even though you can get kind of the same result with the D7100 by setting that camera in AF-C 3d, still that function is not as perfect like the one in the D750.
Before, with my D300, I had to use at least 2 speed lights to get the shot done while shooting indoors. Now, I do not have the need to use flashes anymore. My D750 is capable to 'illuminate' any dark room and turn it into a very bright one. It does not fail ! It is capable to shoot even in dark environments, something that is not possible with the D7100.
I also have the capability to shoot almost 6 frames per second; the color rendition are excellent, the body is very light and ergonomic, the shutter feels secure under your finger, excellent life battery ( more than 1k shots ); believe it or not, this camera shoots excellent jPEG pictures even at high ISO. The body is weather sealed. The other night I was shooting under a light rain and I did not even bother trying to protect my camera. For me, it has been a great move and worth the investment. The only flaw is that at the moment, you are not capable to download your RAW files ( I shoot in RAW ) directly from the camera to your photo processor unless you do have a RAW converter. I use aperture and I bought the ExifChanger program from Apple for $10 dollars and with that little program, I am capable to convert my RAW files as if they were shot with the Nikon D5300. As a temporary solution, it is a great choice, till Nikon release the RAW file format.
I won't give you my opinion about the video capabilities of this camera because I am not a videographer and I do not really care about that at all. I am a photographer 100% and as such, if you are looking for a camera that will help you to improve your pics in any kind of environment, assuming that you have the lenses and the experience, this is your camera. Not that expensive as the D800 or D4 but at the same level of those cameras. The D750 produce much better clean shots than the D800 and its AF-S system is on par with the top of the line, D4 series. Isn't a great choice ? In my humble opinion, yes it is by all means !!"^5^Nov 15, 2014 6:56 AM
YRaj^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^29^0^"I am professional photographer who mainly shoots events. I have shot with the D40, D3000, D90, D700 and D800. The D800 is an amazing camera but moody. Along comes the D750, billed as an 'Action' camera. When I heard that it was only 6.5FPS, I was sorely disappointed and was very critical of Nikon. However, after reading a review by a world class wedding photographer about the D750. I decided that this was the camera I needed to work alongside the D800 at events.
After using the camera for 3 weeks, I have to say that I am completely floored. The problem, that I feel guilty about, is that I am not picking up my D800 anymore.
Pros
I can say this enough...the autofocus beats the D700, D800, D7100. I was able to shoot some volleyball shots that came out clearly at ISO 10000, and 90% of the shots were keepers even when blindly shooting at the action. It also focuses quickly in low light..one of 2 main reasons for purchasing this camera.
Autofocus - on Area mode auto...which means the camera picks the focal point. Amazing!!! It automatically focuses on the eyes. This means that when shooting portrait shots, you are able to shoot continuously freely which results in better candid shots.
Low Noise! - I shoot at ISO 10800 with no fear. This is a game changer for me allowing me to shoot more creatively without having to focus and recompose.
WIFI - love the fact that I can post photos to social media while out in the field. Transfer is fast and effortless on my Note 4. See image of Heron.

Cons
FPS - I would have liked more than 6FPS on this latest camera from Nikon. Still this did not prevent me from getting great bird shots..see image.
Grip - does not increase FPS."^5^Nov 24, 2014 8:39 AM

I'm so happy that I decided to purchase the D750. The camera is awesome! Great auto-focus in low light, superb metering system, excellent image quality, and great video, what more could you ask for!

Pzl1nz^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^0^"Hi all,

I am absolutely amazed with this camera and the pictures this beast takes! I wanted to upgrade to FF, coming from a Nikon D7000. The D810 was out of my price range and I didn't want a 36MP camera eating up hard drive space. The D610 seemed good but I wanted more features. Enter the D750... To me this is essentially a D810 (technology) in a smaller, lighter body, with picture sizes that are much more manageable at a competitive price range.

I read tons of info before buying and the features that drew me in were low light performance, new focus system, dynamic range, high ISO performance. I bought this from my local BestBuy who ordered it for me on their website, it was delivered in 3 days. Got it home, customized a few things in the menu, and started shooting. This camera blows away my expectations. As of right now I have paired this body to a Nikon 50mm 1.8D and a Nikon 70-200 2.8 VRII. Pictures are stunning. I also have some crop frame lenses for my D7000 that will work but the sensor crops down photos on this camera and you are then losing all of your full frame resolution. I think I am going after the Nikon 28-300 for an all around carry lens and the16-35 for some wide end shooting.

It just does everything so well. I really have yet to see something it is doing that I don't like, which is an absolute first for me on any camera. I am keeping the D7000 as a backup camera and for long reach wildlife shots where I can get the crop frame benefit of longer effective reach.

In addition if I let the wife shoot it, it does a great job in the auto modes (better IQ and getting the shot you think you want) and this makes it fun for her (novice) to pick up the camera and have confidence in the pictures she is taking. It is funny to see how less scared/intimidated she is of using a DSLR. There is no fuss, just put in P or Auto and the camera does the rest beautifully.

LouisK^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^8^"I tested both the D750 and D610 for my upgrade to FX. The D610 is a great camera and I would recommend it without hesitation, but the D750 is so much more.

The first thing I noticed on first using it was it's ergonomics. The grip feels better that the grip of the D610 and my older DX bodies. Also, it is significantly lighter than the other bodies. Even with a heavy lens attached, it is still comfortable to wear for hours around the neck.

The second thing I liked was the high ISO abilities. I can routinely shoot at 800 to 1600 ISO and have the noise level equal that on the D610 at 400-800. These were also shots that I usually missed out on with the DX bodies.

Another night thing for a transitioning photographer is the ability to adjust the recorded frame size from FX to DX. The D610 also has this feature, but the D750 adds a mid step in that I find very useful and use often with my DX 10-20 lens for landscapes.

The last thing I want to touch on was the speed. This is the fastest camera I have had in recording the images to card. I shoot both RAW and high quality JPGs. This camera takes two SD cards, and allows to record RAW to one card and JPG to another, but I configured mine to use the second card as overflow instead. Even with writing both to the same class 10 card, I never have it get too slow. It does slow down due to filling the buffer, but I can sustain approximately a 3-5 FPS on continuous shooting (low). The variance depending on what I am shooting. Regardless, I have not lost a shoot on high school sports shoots due to filling the buffer the way I did on my older bodies.

The Only thing I don't like is the spread of the autofocus points. As it is still supporting DX lenses, Nikon couldn't put the autofocus points out too far. The spread is greater than that of the D610, but if you like to compose with your point of focus off from center be prepared to focus then recompose."^5^Oct 13, 2014 11:21 AM
BoardBurtonVT^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^2^"This camera is a solid upgrade over the D610 and provides a lot of the utility that the D810 gives you, while only losing resolution. 99% of the photographers of the world would have no need for a 36 mega pixel image (in fact it will probably just eat up your hard drive space twice as fast and be a problem). The focusing is fast, the low light focusing is great, ISO noise is nearly undetectable at f8 or higher up until 7200 or so.

Live view is much improved from my old DX camera (D5200), the video capabilities are great (1080 at 60fps!). The controls are smooth, the grip is comfortable and the WiFi lets you use your cell phone as a remote shutter, eliminating the need for some expensive peripheral pieces.

I've used the 24-70mm 2.8g and the 85mm 1.8g, as well as the 18-200mm DX and 10-24mm DX lenses. Its sharp with everything, the shutter is quiet and solid feeling.

Nikon really hit a home run with this camera. If you are wavering between this and a D610, just do yourself a favor and skip the D610."^5^Oct 3, 2014 1:22 PM

BDahl^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"Finally decided to take the step up to a professional level DSLR. My last camera was a Canon Digital Rebel T1i. I had a price range of $3000-$4000 in mind for the body and lens combined. My last DSLR purchase included an 18-55mm lens. While the zoom was a nice feature to have, I was not too terribly impressed by the build quality of the 'stock' lens that came with the camera.

For this purchase, I decided that the D750 body would be in the right range for my needs, I am very happy with 24 megapixels. While I have not taken full advantage of some of the custom settings and added features in this model, I can say that it takes some amazing pictures when paired with the Nikkor 24mm f/1.4 lens. I am very happy that I purchased a lens separately; although I am sometimes limited by a lack of zoom, the Nikkor 24mm lens is a beautiful performer and I can crop my pictures reasonably well while still keeping the images a decent size, thanks to the 24mp sensor. Just after purchasing the set, Nikon announced their latest 24-70mm zoom lens. If I had a little more cash in the budget and a little more patience, I would probably had purchased the zoom lens.

I don't regret switching from Canon to Nikon and am glad I didn't have much stock in Canon lenses. I plan on sticking with Nikon for the future and plan on adding to my lens collection over the years to come. Lets hope they don't change the mounting system any time soon. All in all, the Nikon D750 is a great first entry into owning a professional DSLR and I am very pleased with my purchase."^5^Aug 17, 2015 8:58 PM
jhonny0099^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^4^"Being a part-time working professional, I've been waiting for a decent entry to full frame (not the D600/D610) without going to the 36MP monster D810 or the outdated D700. When the D750 was announced, I knew it was time to send my D7000 to backup duty and upgrade.

The 24MP sensor is imo the perfect mix of resolution that allows for more cropping while maintaining great low-light capability and manageable file sizes. At first, I thought it performed similarly to my D7000, which is great, but once you take a closer look at images shot at ISO 6400+, it's crazy how clean it is. ISO 12800 is actually usable, and at normal size, is almost indistinguishable from ISO 3200.

The larger viewfinder is a definite plus, however I do wish the points were spread a bit wider. I haven't had a chase to put it through a real test yet, but the AF does seem awesome. It will pick focus in a nearly black room, even with an outer point. Still need to experiment with the AF-C and new Group Area, but seems promising.

I LOVE the grip and how light the camera is without feeling cheap. It's actually lighter than my D7000. The grip is taller and much deeper, which allows me to hold a heavy 70-200 more comfortably without straining my fingers. On my D7000, I could never do that without a battery grip. The control layout is mostly familiar to the D7000, although I would like a separate ISO button and AF-ON. I don't plan on using the tilt screen much, but it seems sturdy.

I am a bit disappointed in the white balance performance, although I shoot RAW so kind of a non-issue, but it's nice to get it close in camera. It seems that the AWB indoors tends towards making things very green/goldish. I have dialed in some compensation, but I hope a firmware update will fine tune this.

Overall, a great mid-range full frame that provides enough capability for a pro, all in a lightweight body. I hear many wedding photogs are trading in their older D3S or D4 bodies to go with D750s instead of D4S."^4^Mar 30, 2015 8:14 AM

I am very happy to have taken a big step up, The D750 is worth the money, easy to use in ordinary situations, and not a major drag on my luggage.

But there is so much the camera can do that it's clear I will need to start improving my game. Any problems with my images now are clearly the fault of the photographer, not the tool."^5^Aug 24, 2015 7:40 AM

The camera finds the face and focuses on it. I enjoy taking pictures again,it is so much lighter and smaller than the d3,and does everything better except for the continuos shooting is only 6.5 fps,good enough for most of my needs as I don't shoot sports much anymore. For sports the d4s is the best,and for landscapes and large prints or fine art the d810 is the best.all others will love the d750 as a do. The d7000 was a very good camera,but the d750 is so much better in low light,and the full frame sensor has so much better bokeh that I will never want to go back to a dx sensor camera."^5^Jun 15, 2015 12:00 AM

I decided to get the D750 and if it didn't meet my needs I would return it and get the D810. Well, the D750 exceeds my expectations and reinforced my belief that I didn't need the higher resolution of the D810. The D750 is designed so that a novice could use it as an expensive point and shoot and yet it has features that will meet the needs of more advanced users. Although I haven't yet given it a full workout, I am sure I'm going to be very satisfied with the D750."^5^Dec 7, 2014 4:13 AM

It does that amazingly well. At 3200 and even 6400 ISO it produces nice images with very minimal noise( less than my D90 at 800 ISO )The double SD card slots are also nice. The grip is a little thinner and takes some getting used to, but really let's you grab the camera solidly. The only negative is that the manual could be a little easier to understand.

I love the exposure preview option in the live view mode. The camera fits comfortably in my hand, it's not too heavy- it just feels right! But the best thing this camera offers that the 7100 can not is the quality when using a high ISO. I did not like the quality of my pictures when shooting in anything over ISO 400 on my 7100 but with the D750, ISO 1600, 3200 is very doable! And I know I could go higher and still get great pics.

straightoutta818^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^1^"Research and come to your own conclusions as far as needs, wants and budget. There is nothing that I can say that has not already been said...this is a fine piece of art and technology.

I made the jump from DX to FX and have had it only for a couple of weeks. My conclusion is that this camera is a monster for its price point. It has fantastic dynamic range and sharpness. Low light performance is great. The D750's features, performance and price are unique in the Nikon FX lineup. Extremely happy with it so far.

Pros:
Smaller size and less weight when compared to Nikons higher end FX bodies.
Great low light performance. Images stay clean up to about 6400 ISO in most circumstances. You can see in the dark if you have to.
The custom user settings (U1 & U2) are a godsend.
It has a titling rear display that can come in handy with odd angles.
Price vs performance feature set ratio might be the best in the market.
Auto focus is accurate and fast.

Cons (Notice that all but one of the issues below have nothing to do with taking a good photo!):
AF area is bunched up towards the middle of the sensor and does not reach the outer edges of the frame.
Has wireless but you cant do much with it. The Nikon WMA app is pretty limited.
No onboard geotagging. Not a huge issue if you do something off camera like Geotag Photos Pro on a smartphone. I dont care for the Nikon GPS solution as its a pain to sync and is a battery killer.
Video is 1080P at best which means either now or down the road you might want something with 4K capabilities.
Shutter is pretty loud regardless of what mode you set it in.

The reviews are right, this is a stellar camera."^5^Jul 25, 2015 4:49 PM
Russell^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"I upgraded from the Nikon D7000 and have been taking photos over 15 years. The camera has amazing high ISO performance letting me shoot at 4000 ISO with clean photos and even up to 12800 ISO when needed to still get the shot. I really like the ergonomics as it fits my hand very well even for many hours of shooting. I use the tilt screen to get some great shots/video from the ground. This is the least expensive full frame camera you can with with the professional level autofocus and metering systems from the highest end cameras. I prefer to have the 2 SD card slots so one is a backup at all times. Also, the U1 and U2 custom user setting modes on the dial are extremely useful.

I highly recommend going to the closest Best Buy that has a camera store and try it out for yourself as that is the only real way to know if you may like it or not."^5^Jun 8, 2015 4:29 PM

Fantastic low light shooting, 51 point autofocus system from the more expensive D810, can record video at 1920x1080p 60 fps (only 10 minutes at a time, bummer). Dynamic range (color reproduction range) is great for a 24MP FX (full frame) sensor.
Camera grip feels great, buttons are easy to get to.

The battery life also seems to be very good and supposedly improved from the D610 which I also tried but missed not having the moveable screen and wifi which the D750 has.

Gonga^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^1^"The D750 is an astounding piece of technology that will bring you new capabilities, improve your photography craft, inspire you, and help you make great photographs and movies. The superb low-light performance (both autofocusing and image quality), articulating screen for movies and low shots, built-in fill flash, U1 and U2 saved settings modes (you can change every setting instantly for different uses like landscapes and portraits), highly customizable full features, and small form factor, make this a camera that I have a special affinity for in less than a month of use. The combination of professional and enthusiast features is a brilliant synthesis. This is the only full-frame DSLR with a tilt screen, and the low light performance is better than any other Nikon, even the D810, which has no articulating screen, and D5, which has no U1 and U2 modes. I've been shooting Nikon for over 30 years, but this camera reaches a whole new level of creative inspiration."^5^May 6, 2016 11:11 PM
Joel^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^1^"We upgraded from a D3300. The D750 is Nikon's full frame camera in between the D610 and D810. At $1900 (plus lenses if you dont already own) this is a strong value for an aspiring pro, a knowledgeable and well-off enthusiast, or perhaps a backup or more portable model for a pro who already has an 810 or D4S. More autofocus points than the D610 and can switch aperture while shooting video. It makes little sense to buy this camera if you dont know what you are doing or at plan to learn, or if you dont already own or plan to invest in quality FX lenses. But if you have the $ and passion, I dont see much sense in investing in a 7200 new when the 610 and this 750 are just a bit more. Full frame does make a difference. The 1.8G FX primes are a great value, we use the 85 and 50 for my wife's family / portrait gigs, have our eye on a 24, and one day the 2.8 zooms. Be sure to calibrate your monitors and perhaps use a colorcard if you shoot raw."^5^Dec 28, 2015 9:36 PM
Camerabug^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"I am a novice at best but recently upgraded myself from a D7100 to this D750 for full frame experience. The camera itself is very light weight in fact much lighter than the D7100. Outstanding images with 24.3 megapixel CMOS image sensor with crisp sharp photos. The camera is awesome in low light situations with auto ISO but is expandable. So far the battery life has been great for all the functionality of the camera for stills and video. The LCD monitor offers great flexibility for live view and video recording as you can tilt and angle to get a better view of your subject. I'm not shooting movie type video but the quality I'm seeing of my kids soccer games and outdoor activities has been very good so far. My D750 was bundled with a Nikkor 28-300mm 3.5-5.6G ED VR lens which is a really great option for a kit lens since it covers such a vast range of focal lengths. I have been able to capture some nice wide angle landscape images and zoomed in on wild life with really sharp images at both ends. I'm really liking the move to a full frame camera and have already added some additional lenses to my camera bag. If you want to upgrade to full frame but don't want to spend a huge chunk of change on a professional level D810 the D750 is a great option.

The reason I made the change is that the dynamic range of canons new 6d mark ii, which is their $2,000 entry level full frame, was unsalvagable. The dark areas at any ISO were too granular for use. The video quality was poor. I compared the 750 on dynamic range, low light, and video and the 750 is WAY better on all three. It was a lot of work to change over from canon to Nikon, but if what you want is good pictures and not gadgets this is a great camera at a reasonable price. I also noticed reading many 750 reviews that a lot of the 750 owners seemed to have a sort of affection for their 750s. Haven't really seen that consistently on other cameras.

After moving up from a D3200 I am already extremely impressed with this camera. It's a little heavier than the D3200 (as to be expected) but significantly lighter than the D810. If you don't absolutely need those extra megapixels, it's hard to disagree with the D750. For a hobbiest that doesn't want to break the bank or break your back carrying your camera, it's hard to beat this one. I compared this with the Sony A7rii and the D810, and this was the winner for me. I didn't quite like the colors or the EVF of the A7rii, and the D810 was just impractically heavy for a non-pro.

KoASiren^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"When I first started out with photography, I had a D3000. I later upgraded to D7100 when I sold the D3000. As I got more into wedding photography, I realized a second body would be fantastic (rather than constantly switching lenses and maybe missing a great shot). 

I was back and forth between the D500 and D750. Finally, I decided on the D750 because of the full frame. 

It is much faster than I expected it would be. (I'd like to invest in an SD card with faster processing). It's lightweight and the controls are very similar to the DX bodies, so if you're worried about relearning settings, you'll be fine.

The tilt screen is PERFECT for shorter photographers who want more of an above look to the images. Also, great for taller photogs who want low to the ground shots (those are easier for me since I'm closer to the ground anyways, haha). 

I use this camera with Tamron's 70-200 f2.8 lens and a Nikon 35mm prime lens. I love the images I can make with this set."^5^May 19, 2017 2:04 PM

Even compared to my D7200, the D750 is superior in almost every way (and the D7200 is a VERY capable camera). The tilt screen is extremely useful, the build quality is amazing, RAW images are almost noise free even at high ISO's, and the ability to change the aperture while in live view is a feature that I'm glad Nikon was finally able to add to their DSLR's. The built in WiFi works great for instantly showing photos to clients (for that 'WOW!' factor), the movie mode is excellent with high quality video, and the on-camera screen is bright enough to see in broad daylight with excellent color reproduction. The color depth and dynamic range from this sensor are spectacular. Low light focusing isn't perfect, but it's a huge step up from older Nikon models and I've found that some lenses focus much better than others.

I love my 7100, but as one would suspect, the D750 is far more superior.

NikonRulz^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This was a huge step up from my D3100. Seemed heavy at first, but after using for several weeks, not so much. When I pick up my D3100 now it seems like a toy in comparison! After much research, I opted for the Nikon body only and purchased 2 Sigma lenses--a 24-105mm F4 (fast autofocus using D750's back button, and sharp!) and a macro/telephoto 70-300mm. I think these are decent lenses for what I paid for them--much less than Nikon lenses go for. The D750 is a lot of camera, and I am still learning to use some of the customizable features. YouTube tutorials have been indispensable in this regard. The more I learn and practice, the more I love this camera. I'm a little disappointed in the low-light performance. When I put the camera on shutter-priority (I like to shoot handheld, so usually set the fastest shutter speed I can), the camera seems to bump up the ISO higher than needed, resulting in some noisy shots. I often turn off the auto ISO to find the sweet spot. But this is likely more a limitation of my lenses than the camera. Overall, you can't go wrong with the D750! Best Buy sent some freebies w/ this purchase: a 32 GB card, a sling-type camera bag that I'm really liking much more than expected, an extra battery (not Nikon, but works fine), and a Shutterfly book coupon. So kudos to Best Buy for some good swag!"^5^Aug 2, 2015 7:54 PM

I had to make the decision between Nikon and Canon. I am extremely happy that I went with the Nikon D750. The improvements Nikon make to the 750 over the 700 model are fantastic.

I was never totally happy with the crop-sensor, but never wanted to spend the money on a full-frame. Finally I decided to sell the 7100 and upgrade. The low light performance is amazing. I occasionally shoot weddings and in dim light situations this camera performs like a champ. I also love the WiFi capability. On recent vacations I've been able to take pictures and connect them to my phone for quick upload/posting. I almost went cheap and purchased a D700, but I'm glad I used that money towards a newer technology full-frame. Add a prime lens like a 35/85mm and you can create some extremely crisp images.

sm29^/nikon-d750-dslr-video-camera-body-only-black/8753712?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I purchased the D750 because it was similar in body style, weight and buttons to the D7100 I already had. In my opinion, they are a great compliment to each other. However, the D750 is great by itself, especially in low light situations. The image sizes are bigger on the D750 since it's FX format so be prepared for that, and if you're concerned about missing that extra reach you get from a DX camera, you can crop in more in post without loss of quality with the D750. Nikon did a great job with this camera and t's easy to see why this was chosen camera of the year."^4^Jun 29, 2015 7:45 PM

Focusing is extremely fast and accurate (with 24-120 and 50mm 1.8G prime lenses), metering is spot on (it falls in very acceptable limits and with the amazing dynamic range this camera has it is always 'good enough'). The most impressive part is the low light performance - I took few low light pictures at ISO 6400and there was no visible noise. The body feels really solid BUT it also feels a bit small (which can be a plus but the dials are a bit too small - like the dials on 810 better - but I think D750 is far better choice for the money).

I will update my review (if best buy allows the review update, If not a new review will be on its way) once I receive my ordered lens (50MM 1.8g) from best buy. I'm also very new to DSLR world as I have pretty much zero experience in photography and starting wih D750 may be a bit too much but that's where I'm starting with. With that being said, I'd say that the build quality of this product is up there with some of Nikons flagship high end products. The feel of this camera in my hand is very comfortable and it doesn't seem as you are holding something cheap (of course not at it's current price). The button placement on the camera is very easy (however it will take some time to get used to, especially for beginners like me). As I said, I haven't yet used my camera for any photography, I won't have much more to discuss about its functionality until I get my lens and start shooting. The only minuscule thing I noticed so far on this camera was its display which can be tilted in various angles. Depending on your use, it may get caught (if tilted) in the strap or something else which may lead to additional headaches. This however is very minor (in my view), as I may not use the tilt function that often.

I hope to learn a lot from this camera and be able to provide some useful tips/comments in near future.

Can't wait till I receive my lens."^5^Feb 22, 2015 9:35 AM

1. Better AF - better coverage AND better AF-C
2. Better size - I much prefer the smaller/slimmer body and great grip

The AF was spot-on with my fastest lenses (f/1.4) - no AF fine tune needed! A first & portends well for the QC that went into the camera!

Great build quality too. I don't care for the swivel LCD, it's another point of failure.

Other than that, what's with EFFECTS on the dial, smack between M and U2? I should be able to switch from M to U modes without the silly EFFECTS setting (in fact it does not belong on the camera) - if Nikon must pander people who have more money than photographic talent, create a silver 'premium' version for them. Leave the Df target segment with a cleaner layout.

The Sony Sensor used in the Nikon D750 has better dynamic range than the Canon, but not by much, and frankly most people would never know the difference in a comparison test.

Deutschlandreform^/canon-eos-77d-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-55mm-is-stm-lens-black/5774201?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^5^"According to Canon, the 77D represents a new category of advanced amateur EOS cameras, supposedly a step above the Rebel series. However, the design of the 77D is very much like previous Rebels and therefore owners of preceding Rebels will find the camera feeling pretty familiar.

Compared to some of the previous Rebels, the 77D has even more pre-set shooting modes and filters, which Canon grouped under SCN, respectively Creative Filter mode. The camera also features slow continuous shooting. Related to this, one might note that with the 77D the frame rate of Canon entry-level DSLRs has increased to 6 fps - which should be adequate for most amateur photographers. In any case, but especially when shooting RAW, a fast memory card which can handle a lot of data is advisable.

The main new features of the 77D worth noting are the 45-point all cross-type AF system and the DIGIC 7 image processor. The improved and now very responsive display with swipe functionality makes looking through the pictures a lot faster and easier.

Amateur photographers looking for a compact, lightweight DSLR camera with an extensive feature set and great image quality for a reasonable price, will enjoy the Canon EOS Rebel 77D. (Beginners who do not care about the top LCD panel and the rear quick-control thumb dial, might as well save $100 and buy the basically identical T7i instead.)"^4^Jul 30, 2017 1:33 PM
RachelR^/canon-eos-77d-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-55mm-is-stm-lens-black/5774201?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^1^"This is an amazing camera for semi-beginner photographers who want the ability to grow into more advanced features. This camera is almost identical to the Canon Rebel T7i, but where the two cameras differ is in their capability for manual function - which, if you plan to transition into intermediate or professional photography, is essential to become comfortable with. The Canon 77D is incredibly easy to learn how to use, especially if you choose to enable the guided mode (the user-friendly interface that comes preset on the Canon rebel series). Another great feature is the WiFi-enabled Canon connect app,which allows you to transfer your photos directly from your camera to your phone. The 18-55 mm lens is a great lens for close-range portrait shots, but if you plan to take any photos outside, then you need to purchase a polarized lens to attach to the end of your lens - this will ensure that your colors are crisp and clear. Overall, the Canon 77D was a great purchase, and I have no complaints."^5^Jul 22, 2017 1:13 AM

I actually do some portrait photography on the side and my clients have been happier than ever with the results. The T4i was a great camera to learn on and this was a great upgrade. The 80D looks like a great equivalent as well, but professional reviewers will point out that the newer Digic processor in the 77D give it the edge."^5^Aug 4, 2017 9:49 PM

Some of the good things it has going for it are its nice size that not to bulky. It does have digital stabilization that can only be used for video. Having IBIS in the 77D would have made this a great camera over software based stabilization. Also the lack of a 100% viewfinder is a bummer as well as no 1/3 stops of ISO.

The camera takes great pictures though and handles well in low light for pictures. It does fall short for low light video recording though. It's dual pixel auto focus is fast and accurate. Of course everyone is scratching their head why Canon still is not bringing 4K recording capabilities to their consumer priced cameras so if your looking for 4K, you won't find it here.

I've watched a lot of videos on photography and this specific camera and at this point I am still working to figure out everything. However, what I can say at this point, is so far I love this camera! 

One of the things I really like are all the options for manual adjustments. There are specific options for everything you might need to change while taking a picture in specific scenarios. The other nice thing is it also has all the automatic options as well, meaning the camera will adjust the settings to whatever it thinks are correct for your situation. This gives the opportunity to see what automatic settings the camera would use and then switch to manual and play around. 

As I said earlier, this is still new to me and there is a lot still left to learn. I bought this camera for a trip my family and I are taking in a few months. I thought this would give me time to figure out the camera before that. The quality is amazing with the new sensors and high MP count. With the top dials and the scroll wheel it is easy to change settings on the fly. I only have two lenses, the one that came with the kit and another additional lense that I have yet to use.

Colors are vivid and accurate, I have a D5, might be selling it for a second d850. I'm a wedding and fashion/portrait shooter, do some sports now and then. The auto focus was dead on with my 105mm 1.4. Didn't calibrate didn't need to. Focus ability is every thing to me. It's got to be sharp and quick, keeper rate will really go up with this. The view finder is huge and makes it easy to see your focus and composition. Don't really care about the resolution, anything over 16 to 20 is a good enough for most work. I will shoot at 45 when I need to crop and for large group pictures. I still need to dial it in but noise at high iso was nice and low. Really making it hard to justify the d5... Except that d5 can see in the dark. If your serious about your photography and pleasing clients this is the camera to own. Canon is going to be scrambling. Nikon loves to drop a big one every now and then, this is going to be like the D3 revolution all over again."^5^Sep 9, 2017 11:45 PM
PhotosByFry^/nikon-d850-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6084300?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^1^"I have owned 3 Nikon Hi-Res dslrs the D800, D810 and now the D850. Every model has been a leap in tech but what Nikon has done now is truly stunning. I just love this camera and battery grip! And it shoots 4k views and 8k time lapse.

Key Specifications:

45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor
7 fps continuous shooting with AE/AF (9 with battery grip and EN-EL18b battery)
153-point AF system linked to 180,000-pixel metering system
UHD 4K video capture at up to 30p from full sensor width
1080 video at up to 120p, recorded as roughly 1/4 or 1/5th speed slow-mo
4:2:2 8-bit UHD uncompressed output while recording to card
1 XQD slot and 1 UHS II-compliant SD slot
Battery life rated at 1840 shots
3.2' tilting touchscreen with 2.36M-dot (1024768 pixel) LCD
Illuminated controls
19.4MP DX crop (or 8.6MP at 30fps for up to 3 sec)
SnapBridge full-time Bluetooth LE connection system with Wi-Fi
Advanced time-lapse options (including in-camera 4K video creation)

High resolution

The use of a backside illuminated (BSI) sensor means that the light collecting elements of the sensor are closer to the surface of the chip. This should not only increase the efficiency of the sensor (improving low light performance) but should also be expected to make the pixels near the edges of the sensor better able to accept light approaching with high angles of incidence, improving peripheral image quality.

Like the D810 before it, the D850 continues to offer an ISO 64 mode, that allows it to tolerate more light in bright conditions. The D850 promises the same dynamic range advantage as the D810, meaning it should be able to compete with the medium format sensors used in the likes of the Fujifilm GFX 50S and Pentax 645Z.

High Speed

In addition to the increased speed, the D850 also gains the full AF capabilities of the company's flagship sports camera: the D5. This includes all the hardware: AF module, metering sensor and dedicated AF processor, as well as the full range of AF modes and configuration options, which should translate to comparable focus performance combined with high resolution.

Given the D5 possessed one of the best AF systems we've ever seen and could continue to offer that performance in a wide range of conditions and shooting scenarios with minimal need for configuration, this is an exciting prospect.

As part of this system, the D850 gains the automated system for setting an AF Fine Tune value. It only calibrates the lens based on the central AF point and for a single distance, but it's a simple way to ensure you're getting closer to your lenses' full capabilities, which is handy given you'll now be able to scrutinize their performance with 46MP of detail.

LexamusPrime^/nikon-d850-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6084300?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^14^0^"I've owned the camera since it came out and I must say that it is by far the best I've used. I owned the D810 and D500 before it and it flawlessly combines everything I LOVED about those cameras and adds up to something even greater. The focus system is incredible. The low light quality is 2nd to none. I've printed 8.5x11 pictures shot at iso 12800 and people didn't believe the iso they were shot at. The view finder is HUGE and even wearing glasses I can see EVERYTHING without a problem. I also LOVE that I can shoot in a crop mode and the view finder will actually black out everything not being used. Shooting 1x1 aspect ratio through the view finder is a different experience than cropping after the fact and it changes the way you compose. 

The color is flawless. The new auto daylight white balance is very handy. I've found ZERO about the camera I don't like."^5^Nov 4, 2017 2:12 PM

RetiredMarine303^/nikon-d850-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6084300?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^12^0^"This is the best Nikon camera ever made and I have been shooting with Nikon for over 30 years since the 35mm film camera like N70s and N90S. I have over several of Nikon film and now digital camera's and this will most likely be that last digital DSLR I will buy for several years if not the last camera period. Whether you're shooting weddings, landscapes, portraits, action or wildlife, the D850 won't leave you wanting. This is a much more versatile proposition than the D810 (and its closest rivals for that matter), or the (D800E) the D850 is a brilliant DSLR, and perhaps the most well-rounded camera we've ever built by Nikon.

Pros
Potential for large and detailed images
Sophisticated and proven AF system
Large and bright viewfinder
19.4MP DX crop mode
Epic long battery life

Cons
More expensive than D810
Live View focusing speed behind rivals
SnapBridge still clunky, however it does work great and no complaints 

When researching all of the reviewers and seem like they could not say anything but amazing things about this camera. It took a while to research more and then I tried to find the camera and it was on backorder everywhere. Well I placed my order on Bestbuy.com and waited and I finally received my Nikon D85 and now I firmly believe that this camera is the best DSLR camera available today in the market. It is heavy, however it also has a feeling of sturdiness that comes with a well-built camera. The pictures are truly amazing even shooting at high ISO.

Screen: 3.2-inch tilt-angle touchscreen, 2,359,000 dots
Burst shooting: 7fps
Autofocus: 153-point AF
Connectivity: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
Battery life: 1,840 shots

the D850 drops the CompactFlash card slot that was on the D810 in favor of an XQD slot and the performance advantages that brings (although at the moment Nikon is the only manufacturer to take up this storage format on its cameras), while the SD card slot supports cards up to UHS-II. 

The D850 gets Nikon's SnapBridge connectivity for wireless transfer of images, which establishes a low-energy Bluetooth connection between the camera and your smart device. Images can then be transferred from camera to device via as you shoot at either 2MP or full resolution (though we'd avoid this with 45.4MP files), or individually if you select images on the camera. For speedier Wi-Fi transfers you can use the app to browse and select the images you desire.

I have waited a very long time to purchase a new camera because ~my Nikon D700 is still working great along with my Nikon D800E! Upon seeing the specs for the D850, I was really amazed with the ISO range and working in very low light which has been somewhat troublesome for me with my current cameras. I am very happy purchasing this amazing camera and believe it's Nikon's best camera ever made so far! The ISO range is phenomenal. Working in low light is no longer a problem! Shots are very crystal clear, tact sharp, and not at all grainy with no noise. My pictures straight out of the camera do not need any corrections when I transfer to Lightroom....I really had no idea how much work I had been doing with color correction, tonal curves, etc until I uploaded my first batch from the D850! The shutter release is much quieter, and I have used video mode with much success (and I am not a videographer!) Great camera and I'm excited to use it everyday in my wife's Real Estate business! Doing Real Estate Photography is now what I do since I have been semi-retired from event photography. iI highly recommend this camera to anyone who has a passion for photography as I do."^5^Oct 5, 2018 8:16 PM
rniederman^/nikon-d850-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6084300?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^11^0^"This is a very sophisticated and advanced camera capable of making pictures in modes ranging from 'point-and-shoot' to images with highly customized settings. It's important to know this is a big and heavy camera but the features make it a worthwhile companion (for what I want to do).

Enthusiastic reviews on the Internet pretty much some up the camera, so I won't take up space repeating what is already written. Anyhow, I am an advanced photographer shooting art (i.e. street photography), landscape, and table top work. There comes a point in which very high resolution is warranted because you can crop as needed with minimal loss of image quality. Somehow Nikon engineers managed to cram all the good stuff into a single camera. As with any camera, there are limits. However, these limits do not impact my style of work. Another aspect of the camera I wanted was the feature to produce images for focus stacking. It's tricky and needs a lot of thought. 

At this point there are many fine cameras available today and lots of arguments about which is better. I pretty much ignore these discussions [arguments] because my choice is based on my style of photography. FWIW, this camera is paired with a Nikon D750 (which is now my backup camera). As background, I've been shooting since the '70s (up to 11 x 14 inch large format)."^5^Jan 8, 2018 9:44 AM

Landscapes are colorful; easily capturing the rich beauty of the scene. Nine frames per second and great 'tracking' capability allows you to capture the moment regarding action shots. Most importantly the huge, beautiful files allow for tremendous post processing. Both shadows and highlights can easily be refined in Photoshop. Most of the time the files are 'spot on' and you don't need much post processing. For the past seventeen years I have owned many high end Canon, Sony, Olympus, Fugi and Nikon cameras and, by far, the Nikon D850 with the new 24-70 VR lens, has given me the best image quality ever.

Throw in 153 focus points, 8 choices for Area Mode auto focus, focus shift, tilt screen, ISO from 64 to 25,600 and it just keeps getting better and better. The D850 has a more comfortable grip than the old D800 and trading the pop-up flash for better weather resistance is a worthwhile trade off for me. This is one amazing piece of equipment.

Otherwise, the image quality is incredible and the newer features make the camera easy to use. For example, I love the focus shift feature.

SprocketTracker^/nikon-d850-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6084300?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"Have been shooting Nikon gear for a lot of years. 13 years with a Nikon D50 APS-C and then stepped up to the D7500. When I was presented with an opportunity to buy the D850 I jumped on it and have not been disappointed. The transistion from APS-C sensors to a full frame sensor took a bit to get used to especially with the resolution being 8 times the D50 and over 2 times the D7500, but was quickly overcome by changing some of my shooting habits. The resolution is great and the color is awesome straight out of the camera. I already had a collection of full frame lenses so I did not need to buy a a bunch of new gear to transition to full frame, so keep that in mind if you're moving into a full frame for the first time from a crop sensor camera, because full frame lenses work great on crop sensor bodies. BUT crop sensor lenses do not work well with a full frame body unless you switch the capture mode to DX (crop/APS-C) format, in which case its a waste of a great sensor and you should look at the D500 or D7500. I have taken low light, night time, long exposure, and full sun pictures and have had no problems and love the quality of low light and night photos that can be taken with this camera. The menus are natural and intuitive for me since I am a previous Nikon DSLR shooter. I can say this camera is not for everybody due to its size and weight (body alone) and then add in high end all glass lenses and the weight can be a bit much for long day shots for some. I have weighed one of my combinations of the D850 body and Tamron 150-600 and it comes in at just about 7 pounds. So if weight and big size is an issue be warned this is a bigger camera but not un-manageable even for my girlfriend who has small hands."^5^Oct 7, 2018 8:02 PM

Buffer is something that I'm not too happy about. Shooting in 14 bits uncompressed RAW will give u about 20-30 images, nowhere near the # Nikon showed. Change it to 12bits, this # will jump to 40-50. If you dont mind then its the only way to go.

PWPhoto^/nikon-d850-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6084300?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I waited 7 years for this camera. It replaced a D800. Talk about a difference. This camera is the real deal. For me, the best things about this camera are:

1. It very much improved autofocus system. It is so much faster and accurate than the D800.

2. The much improved low light ability.
It allows me to shoot lower ISO in situations where I had to shoot higher ISO on the F800 causing me to have a lot more  noise to deal with.

3. The much wider and better dynamic range. This translates into a much smoother image with less artifacts and noise. 

4. The almost double the frame rate over my D800 on still photography. Since I do have the battery grip and EN-EL18 batteries, I ca nmaximize the speed and get the full 9fps from it.

5. The true silent shooting. This is a big thing for me. I shoot in some situations, where the smallest sound can create a missed and lost shot. Being able to shoot true silent allows me to get images if certain things i could not get before. It is also a dream to shoot in very quiet events where you shooting images of it should not be what holds the attention.

If you have been on the fence about this cameras do yourself a favor and buy it. I chose not to buy the D810 because, for me, it wasnt enough of an upgrade over the D800. Others disagree on that, but it wasnt enough for me and that's why I patiently waited for the D810 replacement. It was worth the wait."^5^Jul 12, 2019 7:30 PM

codyl1992^/nikon-d850-dslr-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6084300?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This camera is Nikon's culmination of decades of product development and digital SLR's. It takes ultra high resolution and combines it with high speed, and does so in a truly polished manner. This is a digital SLR, not a mirrorless camera, so it may not have all the tech of a new mirrorless camera, but it's one of the best digital SLR's ever made. Anyone with full frame Nikon lenses who wants resolution and speed in one body will be absolutely pleased. Over the D810 (which can be found used for half the price) it has more resolution, a tilting screen, enhancements to JPEG processing, 4k video (although if you're serious about video, get a mirrorless camera), silent time lapse modes that don't wear out the shutter, much faster continuous shooting, and a more sophisticated focusing system. 

Don't let XQD sway you away by the high prices of the cards. They are so fast that even 45 megapixel raw files get written almost instantly. 

The resolution is truly incredible. The amount of cropping available to you is game changing if you've never shot on this kind of resolution before. One can shoot far off wildlife and not worry about getting perfectly centered framing, crop to the equivalent of APS-C/DX mode, and still have 19.4 megapixels. That turns my 200-500 lens into a 750mm equivalent still retaining almost 20 megapixels of detail. And it has the focusing system to keep up.

This camera will suit all kinds of photography. This is not a 'first camera.' It's a camera for a Nikon enthusiast or pro who can look at the benefits over cheaper bodies and see a real advantage in their kind of shooting. It's for people who absolutely know what shutter priority, aperture priority, etc mean. Paying 3000 dollars for a camera won't make you a better photographer, but having 45 megapixels and a killer autofocus system might help you crop for better framing and give you more keepers or more 'reach' with your lenses. These are the things that must be weighed when determining if you should buy this camera. For many types of shooting, a D750 or D7500 makes more sense. I believe that for me, this is the last digital SLR I will ever need due to the emergence of mirrorless. Mirrorless offers promise of more technology to help make pictures easier since DSLR's have reached a bit of a plateau, inherent to their design. I also own a Nikon Z6, and for casual shooting without action, its a great camera; and the Z cameras will continue to get better. But right now, the D850 is simply unbeatable for all uses except video, where the Z cameras have an inherent mirrorless advantage. 

Great camera, well done Nikon."^5^Mar 29, 2019 10:34 AM

D500 is a beast, this camera does everything much better than the D90 as one would expect. Where is really shines is on the edges of performance, the speed both of focusing and of FPS is just spectacular. I'm VERY glad I waited till the 500 came out, I had played around with D7000/7200, to me the 7000 was just not worth the money when it came out, the 7200 would have been a nice step up, but this 500 is not a step, it's a leap. The white balance is simply worlds better than on the 90 and so is the jpeg engine with high ISO shots. These are both very important to me as I take both RAW and jpeg, but I don't want to have to spend my whole time in Photoshop correcting. With the jpegs right out of the camera they are stunning.
On my D90 I would never shoot above 1000 ISO as it was just too noisy, with the D500 it has been on ISO 2000 for the last few days and I have gone up much much higher with great results. I just love this camera as I did with my trusty D90 that has served me well over the last 8 years. Hopefully the 500 will also. The shot of the chipmunk was done on the D500 with the 200-500 lens. A VERY highly recommended lens"^5^May 1, 2016 4:49 PM
DigitalCMH^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^25^0^"I never thought I'd go back to an APS-C sensor camera. I love full frame and figured that would be all if ever use. I started from Nikon's D70, D200, D300 (got stolen) and for the last years I've been using the D700. I've been. Drooling for the D810 for its 36mp but never pulled the trigger on the $3000 price tag.

In the last 2 years I have gotten into wildlife photography which lead me to the Tamron 150-600 and to my current Nikon 200-500mm lens. Great gear, but on a 12mp body and only 5 FPS, I find myself struggling with small and nimble birds. Missing focus and the 'money shot'. 

I have only had the D500 for a couple weeks but because of the 1.5 APS-C crop and the MP boost from 12 to 20.9, I am seeing details I have never been able to manage before. It's blowing me away! And 10 FPS is getting some really good action that I usually miss. 

Why not stay FF and pick up a D610 or D750? Buffers are too small for high speed RAW shooting. Even my D700 slows me down. But so far the D500 appears to be a home run."^5^May 6, 2016 5:37 PM
RyanY^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^18^2^"I upgraded from at D7100, which I think is still an excellent camera, despite it's tiny buffer. The D500 is Nikon's flagship DX camera, aimed at enthusiasts and professionals alike. The layout (as you can see), is that of it's typical 'pro-line' cameras, such as the D810, and the D500's predecessor the D300/D300s. The grip is along the same, comfortable feel as the D750, with a deep well that's comfortable for bother smaller hands and large hands. Potentially, you can change all of your on-the-fly settings (shutter, Aperture, ISO, Exposure Comp) with one hand with the ISO button placement. My favorite feature is most certainly the multi-selector (usually reserved for professional bodies like the D5). While you can still use the direction pad to move the AF point, the multi-selector just makes it more intuitive, and the placement makes sense, being so close to the AF-ON button. Pressing the Multi-Selector will also engage auto exposure lock if you need it. 

Speaking of the Auto-focus, it's amazing! It uses a 153-point AF system that covers the image end-to-end (left to right). There are 55-selectable points in both AF-S and AF-C, but it still uses the other 98 points as support, which works particularly well in AF-C mode. Another tidbit (and something all DSLR uses should be doing) is that upon inspection of where the AF point focuses with a single AF-point box (center-point), the actual coverage area expand beyond the box on all sides. I assume that that this is the work of the unselectable AF-points that surround a single selectable point (excluding the AF-points along the edges).

ISO Noise is another surprise I was not expecting. Yeah, it has a sizable range of 100 to 51200 with extendable ranges of 50 on the low end and 1,640,000 on the high end. I won't get into low ISO performance (which is good, unless you're at an extreme EV number... don't know why you would do that in the first place), but at higher ranges, it performs flawlessly.. mostly. My experience came down to the overall lighting situation, as well as what lens I use. Yes, good glass matters with ISO. I've done some outdoor portrait shoots in varying lighting. I was at ranges between 400 and 1600, mostly sticking to 1600 using either a Sigma 24mm f1.4 Art or the Nikkor 70-200mm f2.8G VRII. The pictures came out amazing. In pixel-peep mode, the noise was very fine, and it looked even better when I went black and white In fact, I even introduced more noise to the pic (very little.. but enough) and it looked like a shot I took from my Nikon F3 on ISO 800 film. Then, when I actually printed them out, there wasn't any noise at all. It doesn't stop there, folks. I set this up alongside my Sony a7SII for some astrophotography, and I was getting same noise in a ISO 1600 shot from the a7SII as I was with the D500 at ISO 800. The conditions were not as ideal as I want it (scattered clouds in heavy light pollution), but I was able to pull part of the galactic center with the D500 as I could with the a7SII. The reason why I would rather use the a7SII for astro overall is that it's full-frame, and the mirrorless-centric features like Focus Peaking and Bright Monitoring are amazing tools to utilize for astro. 

Overall, the Nikon D500 is about as good as it comes in an APS-C format camera. This camera is for certain making full-frame counterparts like the D750 run for the hills and Nikon has managed to close the gap between FX and DX bodies in terms of noise handling considerably. I'm surprised how well the D500 manages ISO noise, it's plenty fast for it's true purpose (sports and wildlife), but is well capable as a portrait and astro shooter. I think Nikon's future is bright because this camera and the D5 is paving the way for future FX products. For what it does, the price to play is well worth it. I highly recommend what will become the next legend in Nikon's lineup."^5^May 10, 2016 3:09 PM
Fixmeister^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^0^"I have been shooting Nikon cameras since the D70 came out. I've owned the D70, D200, D7000, D7200 and now the D500, They all have been great cameras (except maybe the D7000 with its back-focus issue). I still have my D7200 and have no plans to sell it. It still is an incredible camera. 

But while the D7200 has more megapixels than the D500 it pales in comparison when things start to move. The autofocus in the D7200 is pretty good but the D500 is amazing. Every reviewer will tell the same story. It finds focus and locks on. So why the 'but'?

The D500 is a professionally built body and has professional controls and capabilities. And the autofocus, while better by a mile, is not the same beast as the D7200. The 'Dynamic' in particular is a bit troubling and does not behave like previous generations of Nikons did in that autofocus mode. If you shoot birds in flight (BIF) you will have better success in 'Group' or '3-D' modes. I'm still experimenting and practicing with it but can affirm that once you begin to understand how the system works, your keeper rate will skyrocket.

Some things to know about this camera:
Its really, really fast. 10fps is addicting and you'll wonder how you got by with anything less.
If you have a remote cable from a 7000 series Nikon, it's not going to work with the D500. The D500 cable remote uses a 10-pin, screw-in style cable attachment and not the plug in ones used in other cameras. I had one leftover from my D200 and it is the same one used by the D500. Glad I saved it.
To get the maximum possible capture rate without buffer slow down you will need to budget for an XQD card. They weren't cheap before and they've gone up. Right now only one manufacturer (Sony) is making them and with no competition, they can charge what they want. But, before I purchased one, I used a reasonably fast SD cart and couldn't slam the buffer. So, if you don't think you'll be shooting 200 consecutive shots in a row, a fast SD card will probably be just fine.
I wasn't able to develop any confidence in the 'Auto Fine Tune' feature of lens calibration. Frankly, if you think you have a lens that is back or front focusing, you're better off with a lens calibration target and a tripod. And a cable release.
Battery grip... the thing is ridiculously expensive for what it is, but I bought one anyway. And I can honestly say it's the first Nikon grip I've added to any of my cameras that does not move or wiggle once installed. I prefer the feel of a camera with the add-on grip and this one does not disappoint.
There are a ton of customization options available for this thing and you will come to appreciate that.

Now... about whether you should buy one... it depends. If you shoot family gatherings and landscapes, you won't realize any benefit over a D7200 or D7500, if you have one. In fact, my D7200 is a better camera for that, especially if you have a CLS Nikon flash and intend to use the pop-up flash to fire it. The D500 has no built-in flash and if you intend to control other flashes wirelessly, you'll need a controller or another flash to do so.
Also, the 24mp cameras have more resolution and although the difference doesn't seem like much, it IS noticeable. Especially if you are looking for maximum pixel-peeping. If you have a D7000 or D7100, it will be a big step forward.

Is it $800 better than a D7500 or $1200 better than a D7200? That depends on whether you are a sports or wildlife shooter. If you are, the answer is a resounding 'yes'. If not, then probably not.
But if you ARE a wildlife shooter, this is the best of the best out there. I highly recommend the Nikon 200-500 F5.6 lens to go with it. It's a great combo. You won't be disappointed... after you spend some time with it. This camera does not suffer fools and will require you to spend time getting to know it. But that's true of any high-performance product.

I highly recommend this thing to anyone who can and will use it for what it's designed to do. Hope this review helps someone on the fence about buying one.

EricBowles^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^17^2^"I love the D500. I've had more than a dozen Nikon DSLR cameras and this one is great. I photograph professionally and teach workshops. 

The WOW features on this camera are the frame rate and the low light performance. At 10 FPS, the camera is fast, but more importantly, with a fast XQD memory card like the Lexar Professional 2933X XQD, the write speed is nearly enough to keep up with the frame rate so the buffer never fills. You can rattle off 200 frames in a burst, then repeat with another burst of the same size. Not everyone needs this kind of speed, but for sports or wildlife it is very helpful.

ISO performance of the D7200 was already quite good for a DX sensor, and this is just a little better. The advantage comes at higher ISO levels - great for low light. The D500 is about a half stop better than the D7200 under low light conditions making it nikon's best DX camera.

Handling is typical of Nikon DSLR cameras - a solid, well built body with controls easy to access. I had no problem adjusting settings without every taking my eye from the viewfinder. The key change is the Mode and ISO buttons have been switched from the typical layout. This places the ISO button next to the shutter - easy to access and make changes that can be seen in the viewfinder.

Card speed matters with this camera. Get a fast XQD card for best performance - a Lexar Professional 2933x or Sony G XQD card. Other cards will not perform at peak speeds and will fill the buffer in a shorter time.

In the SD slot there are several options. I bought a Lexar 2000x UHS-II SD card, but there are some issues with this card and I would not recommend it until the issues are resolved. Be sure to get a UHS-II card for best speed. UHS-II has a second row of contacts and requires a new reader for peak speed. The Sandisk 280 MB/s UHS-II or Toshiba Exceria Pro UHS-II are good, fast cards. Stay away from slower cards like the Lexar 1000x or any UHS-I card. The camera can use UHS-I SD cards in an emergency, but they operate in compatibility mode and are much slower.

This camera is the nice upgrade to the D300. It's a solid choice with a lot of great features. My bread and butter camera is still my D800E, but this camera is a very good compliment and my choice for moving wildlife and sports."^5^May 10, 2016 3:17 PM
DusterBuster^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^2^"The Nikon D500 is a camera that professionals and enthusiasts have waited 7 years for. It replaces the D300s and is at the top of the APS-C market. The closest comparable competitor is the Canon 7D-MKII, and even it can't touch the build quality and performance of the D500. Now, lets talk about what makes the D500 great:
-20.9 megapixel sensor with EXPEED 5 image processing. This processor is top of the line and the only other camera that has it is the $6500 D5. 
-153 Autofocus points that cover the sensor edge to edge with 99 of the points being cross-type. Shooting with this camera doing sports and wildlife shooting in bursts, the AF tracking is superb and unrivaled by any alternative.
-ISO covers from 100-51,200 natively! This is unheard of in an APS-C body until now. This means this camera performs well even in low light situations. Look up some of the ISO tests on this camera and you will see that it impresses even at these higher ISO's. It can shoot up to 1,640,000 ISO, but that is not natively and is not recommended by Nikon.
-4k Video. You may have heard that it does have a 1.5x additional crop factor when shooting video. Don't worry too much about that, if you are shooting with the correct lense, it won't be a problem. That said, the 4k video is amazing and looks great on my 4k TV.
-Dual card slots. This camera includes one SD and one XQD card slot. While expensive, XQD is blazing fast and virtually eliminates the buffer so that you can continuously shoot. Speaking of buffer, even with SD, this camera is no slouch. Even shooting with SD only, I've never had to stop and wait for the buffer when using the continuous shooting features.
-10FPS. That's right, you can capture 10 shots per second when shooting continuously. This is a feature you will find VERY useful for sports and wildlife photography.
-Snapbridge is a new feature, exclusive to the D500 at the moment, that lets your camera connect to your phone via NFC/Bluetooth for image sharing among other features.

All-in-all, this camera is a beast and an absolute must-have for any sports or wildlife photographer. Yes, it's no slouch for weddings, landscapes and portraits as well, but Full-frame sensors will surely outperform it in those areas. I would personally pair this camera with a D810 and use this one for the sports/wildlife and the D810 for Weddings/Portraits/Landscape.

If you are in the market for a new high-end professional grade APS-C sensor, this camera is the one for you. Definitely buy it!

Below, I've included a pair of photos taken with the camera."^5^May 31, 2016 9:17 AM
Clickasaurus^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^8^0^"As a retired photographer, I've been all Nikon since 1973 when I purchased my first Nikon F. I've owned at least 20 professional Nikon cameras over the years. After 12 days with my new D500, I'm blown away! I also have a D810 and D750, and bought this for the Dx sensor for wildlife. 

The D500 build feels really strong... It reminds me of the D810 except slightly smaller and lighter. The sensor is amazing, and can be cranked up to 51,200 ISO for uncapturable captures in VERY low light. The ISO can go higher, but the images become very noisy. 

The shutter is fast! The 10 FPS shutter is flawless, and the auto-focus keeps up with your moving targets. I have not had to fine-tune at all, even with my 600mm F4. This camera is a bargain! Great build, great sensor, great shutter, great AF system, great deal!

I carry the 300mm F4 PF on my D500, and it is a terrific combination for shooting small birds hand held. If you shoot Nikon, and seek a professional level of performance from your cameras, the D500 definitely fills the bill!

This is that camera. It enters the lineup as the 'Flagship DX Body' for professional use in the Nikon range. This camera is fast. 10 Frames Per Second, and a hefty 200 frame buffer in 14-bit RAW (when using the XQD Memory Card Format) make this a real winner for sports, action, and wildlife photography. This body puts out beautiful files, for both photos AND video. It is capable of 4K capture, with a 1.3x Crop (on top of the already existing 1.5x crop from it being a DX body). I bought this camera with a Nikon AF-S 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR lens, and the two make a strong pair for wildlife. I would definitely recommend this lens and body combination.

svllc^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I'm going to start with what I don't like about the camera!
 
Cons: SnapBridge, WiFi, Tilt screen and Touch screen. 
This camera is geared towards sports, action and wildlife photographers. Those are features that are not needed for these types of work, (with the exception of the tilt screen for some video footage). Snapbridge and wifi should only be on the entry level cameras (IMO)! If you're in a rush to post to social media, chances are that the photo isn't that good to begin with! 
 Specular Highlights: Very temperamental and often blows them out if not careful!
 Lightroom: I find the color rendering to be off during import into lightroom. It's an easy fix though. A quick adjustment to the color profile in the camera calibration panel to camera flat or camera neutral brings the files back to a good starting point!

 Pros: AF speed, Accuracy and continuous AF tracking is nothing short of amazing and is where this camera really shines!
ISO Performance: Excellent for a DX body. I personally wouldn't go beyond iso 4,000 but that's very good for DX IMO!
Ergonomics: A+. If you own a D810, switching between cameras is like night and day.

James^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^1^"This is Nikon's best DX body and it really delivers. The 10 FPS shooting speed, build quality, and fast autofocus puts it in the same league as the top-of-the-line pro D4 / D5 bodies. Think of this as a 'D5 mini'. 
. 
The ergonomics and build quality is as solid as any of the best full frame Nikon pro bodies. The controls are positioned in a similar way as the pro bodies and I especially like the placement of the ISO button. The grip is a little deeper and lets me handle the larger pro lenses a little easier.
 
The focus fine tune function is one of those 'why didn't they do this before?' features for DSLRs. After making manual focus adjustments in Live View mode, you press 2 buttons and the camera will make the micro adjustment to exactly match the body and lens. Even the best lenses benefit from this feature and the resulting images are tack sharp.

There really aren't many negatives to this camera. It's about the same price and same size / weight as the entry level full frame bodies. But I would skip the comparably priced full frame bodies and get the D500 because it's the next best thing to a D5."^5^May 25, 2016 6:15 AM

Comparatively this thing sees in the dark, much faster speeds with no dig octant grain until you hit the + ISO settings. Continuous shooting is amazingly fast. But I do miss a built-in flash, mostly as a commander for a CLS off-camera flash. Nikon does seem to love add-on dongles, so you need one for a wireless shutter release, and the IR from the 7100 won't work.

I debated between the D500 and the 750 for 2 years. TheD500 is awesome to say the least. Deciding factor for me was the reviews as far as fast action (sports and wildlife) and low light. This thing does not disappoint at any level. Low light, sports, indoor volleyball etc. Just got back from vacation at the Outer Banks, NC. Took some amazing portraits (individual and group) as well as landscape and lighthouse photos. Buy this camera now if youve been thinking about it. I bought the body as I already had several lenses from the D90."^5^Jul 12, 2019 4:49 PM

GreenFlash^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"After owning half a dozen other Nikon DSLR's I am loving this camera because it is so much fun to use. Quick and accurate autofocus results in a high % of keepers. It has a new semi auto fine tune adjustment which can be recorded for each lens you use. The huge list of both DX and FF lenses available for Nikon (including Sigma, Tokina and Tamron lenses) create a very long list of quality glass that's not too expensive for the camera. Need to say that Nikon's sensor technology has narrowed the gap between Full Frame and APS-C lenses, so I don't think I give up much if anything in image quality with this camera. I have been favoring smaller mirrorless cameras, because of their small size and they are excellent, and contrarywise, this camera can in no way be regarded as small. But I have used, and highly recommend, the Tamron 24-70 f2.8 and the Sigma 18-35 f1.8, which are both pro quality lenses for under $1000 (each) Focus is lightning quick and accurate with both of these lenses. I am an old focus and recompose photographer, but this camera has many advanced focus features including a dedicated focus point joy stick and touch screen which I have not yet learned to use, and a tilting screen which I personally use quite a bit for shooting at odd angles. The quality of the jpegs is good, but I have been shooting compressed raw, and very much enjoying the results. I don't use the camera for video, so cannot comment on those features. In my own experience, when I toss a photo, the reason is usually focus. So I love this camera because more than any other, it focuses quickly and accurately. If money is an issue, there are a lot of other cameras that are nearly as good and cost half as much. But if price and video are not that important and you want the best all round APS-c camera that there is, this camera is it."^5^Sep 1, 2016 4:46 PM
BUYINGONLYTHEBEST^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^1^"Very satisfied, so far, with this great camera. Owned a D7000 that was having some intermittent mirror issues, so began looking at a newer model. Originally looking at the D7000 replacement, D7200, but started to check out a move up. Researched the D750 and D500, both in same price range. Learned that, although a great camera, D750 is at the lower end of the full sensor models, while the D500 is the top of the line cropped sensor. For my style of shots, mainly sporting, outdoors, and action shots, the D500 fit the bill better than the D750. Great buy, although still learning some of the differences between my previous models and this one."^5^Aug 26, 2016 5:31 PM
ChuckieSF^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"To start, I'm a hobbyist. I bought this camera primarily to shoot photos of my daughter's volleyball matches but it's done extremely well for just about everything else that I used to use my D610 for. I primarily shoot landscapes so I had to borrow my friend's AF-S 12-24mm f/4 Nikkor and it's been great. 

The AF performance has been outstanding as is the general overall handling of the camera. Image quality is as expected from a pro level Nikon, which is to say that it is outstanding. 

Don't let anyone tell you that this camera has better low light performance than full frame cameras. It pretty much keeps up with my D610 up to about ISO 6400 but the D610 at ISO 25,600 has about the same noise as the D500 at ISO 12,800. The lack of a built in flash means that I need to carry one with me if I think I might need it. Since it's already larger and heavier than the D610 that means even more weight and bulk. Shooting video in 4K has its challenges as there's an additional crop factor on top of the DX crop factor so wide lenses are no long so wide (a 12mm lens has an equivalent field of view as an 18mm lens when taking photos and it has an equivalent field of view as a 27mm when shooting 4K).

Overall, it's an outstanding camera. It offers me more possibilities than my D610 did for everything except for trying to get the least amount of depth of field or where I can't use a flash in a low light situation, both cases where the larger FX sensor has its advantages."^5^Aug 20, 2016 10:20 AM

DaBears^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^1^"So I bought a D7500 bundled with a couple of lenses and some other stuff from Costco. It was a really nice camera. After using that camera for a while and continuing to read camera reviews, I decided to return that bundle and just buy the D500 body from Best Buy. I did this because every review listed the D500 as the 'best' DSLR you can buy today. Well, I usually like the best, so why not?

In another lifetime I owned a Nikon D80, but the shutter stopped working on that so I went into 'strictly iPhone camera' mode for a while. That old D80 took a lot of great family photographs which I now cherish. Since I spent a bundle on this D500, I decided to recycle some old equipment from the D80 ... such as my trusty 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor lens and my SB-800 Speedlight. The lens is a great 'all-around' lens and has worked great on my camera so far. The Speedlight works fine, too, but haven't needed it much since this camera does so great in low-light.

Now ... I'm not a photography genius and I am someone you can usually find using the 'auto' settings. But wait ... there is no such thing on this bad boy. Well, it did take some investment of time ... mostly watching YouTube videos ... but I think I've now got some of it figured out. And it turns out there are still some ways to get the camera to do things for you, aka 'auto,' they just don't exactly call it that and designate a dial or button for said function. Probably to maintain the image as a photographer's camera LOL.

Anyhow, the pictures this thing takes are stunning. FPS ... when cranked up ... sounds like a machine gun. Put on the right settings and you will freeze every step of your son's next drive to the hole! Snapbridge software where pictures transfer to iPhone right away is pretty cool.

Aside from camera, I've jumped into some of the Adobe software for post-processing and that provides another learning curve all its own.

Bottom line ... great camera ... but expect you will have some learning to do if you are coming in from the cold or the dark ages. But I think you already knew that! ;)"^5^Mar 11, 2019 2:48 PM

 I also own a D750, and comparing the image quality with what I get out of D750's full frame 24mpx, the D500 lags little behind in this aspect. Also, the D500 lacks a built-in flash, so the commander mode can't be availed right out.

The 20mp APS-C sensor has incredible dynamic range. This provides greater recovery of those shy animals in the shadows and the noise at high ISO insanely low. I have been able to push my recovery of blown out or dark spots almost 2 stops over my Sony A7RII. You may loose a stop of light with this camera but with better recovery, who cares. I only have 3 gripes. One is that this camera sucks for video. Video quality is good, but the camera is not very user friendly and I wish I could see what I was recording through the viewfinder. That brings me to the second grip, no EVF. Having an EVF is invaluable. Third grip is that all the controls on the left side of the camera force you to break your workflow to use them when using a large lens. A right handed camera should be RIGHT HANDED.

 I have this paired with a 200/500 f5.6 lens and i have turned the shutter control to the slower setting, The first time i pushed the shutter release i took 20 pictures. It is blazing fast...
Controls are set up like most of the other nikon camera and the menus are as well...
 Focus and tracking amazing.. thats all i can say.
 Picture quality? I personally dont feel like the quality is better then the 7200 and D610.. Now im not a professional but i have been shooting for 10 plus years....
 This camera has a special spot in the DSLR family and that would be for anything that moves and moves fast... If weddings are what you are looking to do with camera i would go with a D810 or D750, Even the D610 would be better but you will loss the fast auto focus...

MisterE^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-body-only-black/4870600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^5^"I had a D7000 prior to getting the D500. I needed a new camera that could autofocus quickly to keep up with my 3 year old. I settled on the D500. 

I will say that the camera is built like a tank and has an incredible autofocus system. Those are the two things I miss on my current camera. The D500 doesn't have an auto mode so keep that in mind when purchasing. I saw this as a positive as I don't use auto mode anyway. The rear screen is great and high resolution. The viewfinder is also huge and crystal clear. A true pleasure to use.

The photo quality is quite good, even at high ISO ranges. It's amazing how well you can take photos in low light. There is no flash built in so you'll be pushing your ISO up unless you bring an external flash along. As heavy as this camera is you probably won't want to though. A fast lens and higher ISO worked just fine for me. I used this camera for my family and found it to work well. I also wanted to use it for astro-photography. This is where things fell apart a bit.

The illuminated buttons were a big feature for me. I wanted to use them at night while taking pictures of stars and planets. However, within 3 weeks the illuminated buttons stopped working. Not all of them, just half. I am well versed in cameras and know it wasn't that the lights were turned off. They simply failed. Given the price of this camera I couldn't believe something like that would happen. I ended up returning the camera as I was disappointed in the quality form Nikon. As a result of this and other quality issues from Nikon lenses I sold all of my Nikon gear and switched systems. I use Fuji now and enjoy photography more because of it."^3^Oct 17, 2018 1:30 AM

Except for the remote control by my iPhone, all of my performance requirements were met or greatly exceeded, as reflected in the other reviews; however, I found the wifi and bluetooth features on this camera to be so dysfunctional, including frequent connectivity drop-outs with my iPhone 6S, that I returned the camera for a full refund. I was able to pair the phone and camera and take photos, and found the live view through my phone a great feature, but the inability to reliably connect my phone to the camera was way overly frustrating. The response I received from Nikon's tech support is what sent me back for a refund: 'Unfortunately, Nikon is still testing the compatibility with Snapbridge and the updated iOS 10.2. It is not recommended to use this application until the testing is completed.' SnapBridge is a Nikon app and the only app available for the D500. When spending $2000 (body only) for a high end camera, I expect it to work perfectly all the time, so I will either wait until Nikon gets their act together or go buy a competitor's product."^3^Jan 9, 2017 7:33 PM
JonSolo^/canon-eos-80d-dslr-camera-with-18-135mm-is-usm-lens-black/5005633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^49^0^"There has been much said on this camera and on this series. I will add my brief thoughts:

To begin with this camera is sharp. Don't believe all of the critics out there. It is not as CRISP as some cameras but it is quite sharp. Lenses make a lot of differences, so whatever you do, do not skimp on your lens. If you don't this camera will take advantage of what you attach to it and deliver fantastic results.

My first outing was in Colorado on a nature hike/shoot. I was shooting with the standard lens that came with this bundle (24-135mm USM) and I found it to be more than capable of capturing exactly what I wanted in a walkabout lens. It was clean and easy to use. For the first few days I kept it in automatic and got fantastic picture and video results.

Within a few days I was ready to go manual and again this camera did not disappoint. I did a little research online and found some great videos and suggestions on setup which made it quick and easy for me to get along with manual mode even though I am merely an enthusiast. Again the pictures turned out great and sharp. 

My next step was to take pictures at a wedding. Again I am no pro, but my results made me feel confident in my abilities and I credit great advice online and a great camera with the 80D. Even though the reception was much lower light, and I loathed the idea of using the built in flash, I got some great results. My latest venture was to shoot the super moon and again with some great advice, and this fantastic camera, I got results that I could never get from a point and shoot or a phone. 

For professionals, you already know what you want and will buy it. For enthusiasts or even beginners this can be a great step in the direction of professional photography. 

I opted this over the Sony A6300, even though the video is not 4K. The video performance is fantastic for my usage and I am planning on making a Sony purchase (the A6500) in the next month. But this camera is really spot on for daily usage all around.

It finally arrived last week and my expectations were easily exceeded with this awesome camera. It has many of the features found in the more pro-level cameras and some new ones too. The newly designed 18-135mm lens is a dream come true for this type of camera and, so far, the pictures are clear, sharp and full of vibrant color. As an upgrade to an older model or as a first D-SLR you wouldn't be disappointed if you purchased the Canon EOS 80D. The image of our weeping cherry tree was taken on a cloudy day, but is still very clear when you zoom in for a close up, even though it was resized to 1/5th the original size."^5^Mar 29, 2016 7:44 AM

It's great being able to download pics to my computer wirelessly. I can't wait to play with the other wireless features (controlling the camera from my iPad or phone). The controls are fairly intuitive, with great guides/descriptions for a newbie like me. The 18-135mm lens that came with the camera is a much better and more versatile lens than the standard 18-55mm lens that came with my T5i.

Overall fairly pleased with the 80D. Only thing is I should have paired it with a faster walk around lens.

I will wind up buying a faster lens in the future for lower light situations.

I had the previous model, which is the Canon EOS 70D. Major upgrades have been made to the newer model from the mega pixels, a mic jack and also canon first camera to offer 60 fps with full 1080p resolution. They also included a duel pixel cmos sensor which is outstanding and a big leap in autofocus points for the camera which in my opinion is great for live and viewfinder shooting. This is an outstanding camera all around and top of its class for video recording for amateur and professionals! The camera is comfortable in hand and easy to learn if you are a beginner and carries its classic canon settings which previous canon users are all familiar with.

She was in need of an upgrade now that she started to do photo shoots with our kids and others. Photography is a true passion of hers and I wanted to support her improving the quality of the product she put out. I researched this purchase for weeks before deciding on the 80D. I read the pros and cons of making the jump to full frame, Canon vs. Nikon (I currently shoot Nikon) and I read many reviews. I ultimately selected the 80D for multiple reasons: 1) The quality of the camera and it's features at this price point was unbeatable, 2) The 18-135mm lens offers flexibility, 3) The rotating flip out LCD screen, 4) The size & weight (My girlfriend is a dental hygentist, her hands often bother her so the weight, while more than her previous camera was less than that of the full frame models I was looking at, 6) It's a Canon, and Canon makes great cameras (nothing against Nikon, as mentioned above I still currently shoot with a Nikon, although I'm switching to Canon so we are on the same lens platform)

Overall, this is a great camera! I have not spent that much time with it yet, so I can't review on specific functions other than the Wi-Fi capability that we absolutely love. I can say with 100% certainty that I'm buying the 80D with Video Creation Kit very soon!!

SheldonC^/canon-eos-80d-dslr-camera-with-18-135mm-is-usm-lens-black/5005633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"I've been wanting to get a DSLR camera for quite sometime but didn't know what to get and not to spend so much money. While the Canon 80D is not a Full Frame camera, it suites the need for someone like me who have not used a DSLR camera before and have been away from photography for a very long time.

Although I bought it on sale, it's still expensive. However, I like the advanced features compared to the Rebels for beginnners. I didn't want to pay less for a beginner camera kit then only later have a desire for a more advanced camera while not jumping into professional classifications. This camere is in between for a hobbyist like me.

The pictures I took look amazing. I can transfer the photos through wifi into my Mac or iPhone. The camera came with a 18-135mm F3.5 IS USM lens which is good enough. The kilt also offered a 70-250mm F4 IS STM telephoto zoom lens. I am returning this one because I feel it lacks closer close-ups while in the maximum leghts photos, they're a bit grainy. It can shoot a Full HD video, which I haven't tried yet. With a camera like this and the money spent, I wished it came with the 4K video because the technology is already there.

Over all, I'm still satisfied with the camera and can easily spend more money for additional and better lenses, filters, hoods, external flash, remote switches, extra memories, extra batteries, camera bag, photo editing software, etc."^4^Mar 4, 2017 11:05 AM

The 67 mm lens will provide excellent night photos and the sensor cleaning keeps pictures clear. The high resolution 6000 by 4000 pixels (about double the area of my current cellphone camera) plus the RAW format provides endless options. Wi-Fi helps with the transfer of pictures to my smartphone, printer or web photo processing service and more. I love the remote control from my phone. I will test the Wi-Fi range. I had 11 years of use / 20,000 pictures from my previous Canon (Rebel XT), so it made sense to me to find an equivalent Canon or more professional model."^5^Dec 17, 2018 7:26 PM

I looked into the Panasonics, Sonys and even all the new mirrorless cameras. For me I really like the size of a DSLR, unfortunately I dont have the budget to go full frame but the image quality on the 80D is incredible. When speaking AF no one does it better than Canon the 45 AF points make it so I can just touch the screen what I want in focus and it tracks the object/person with no problem. Stepping up and getting the upgraded nanoUSM 18-135mm lens in the kit was well worth every penny. Great clarity and when using the tracking AF you cant hear the lens parts moving if youre not specifically paying attention to it. 
All in all I think if anyone is looking to upgrade from an entry level/outdated DSLR the Canon 80D just works. Little to no color correction needed for video. I am in love."^5^Oct 13, 2017 4:47 PM

I do wedding videos on the side as a source of supplemental income and I thought what many of you might have, how does this thing do in the 'run and gun' situations, well let me tell you, this things auto focus is the real deal. Not to mention that you can shoot in 60, 30 and 24 FPS.

I had the opportunity to use the 80D, which has improved autofocus (but not that much more than the 70D), marginal dynamic range improvement, and the head phone jack for audio monitoring, and 1080 at 60fps, but it just didn't feel like the upgrade I wanted quality wise for the picture. It felt soft at 1080p (which could be a result of the crop lenses that I used), so I wanted to look for better video quality as my purpose was to use it for videos as well as photos!

I used the new 18-135 Nano USM, and at ~$1700, it was just awesome to use.

But that same money, I ended up going with the a6300 with the 16-50mm kit, 35mm f/1.8, and the 18-105mm f/4.

Better low light performance, just as awesome continuous autofocus, 11 fps when it comes to sports shooting, crop sensor, but also with 4K video.

Canon is protecting its higher end line by not incorporating 4K, something that other companies like Panasonic, Fuji, and Sony are giving to consumers.

Powderhound^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-with-16-80mm-lens-black/4880600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^25^0^"I had tried the D7500, which is the little brother of this camera. Ultimately decided to buy this camera with the 16-80 lens and the battery grip when it went on sale at Best Buy. I liked the D7500 but found the autofocus system to be lacking for sports and action shots. The D500 has the same focus system as the D5. Its amazing. 

The focus system and build quality is better than the D7500. I thought that I might not like the extra weight and size but find that it adds necessary stability, when shooting with telephoto lenses. I own the 200-500 zoom and the D500s focus system, which covers nearly the entire screen area, is amazing. 

I also love the ability to backfocus using the joystick and the other back-focus button, independently. This allows me to assign different focusing systems for each of these buttons. The joystick, which I had thought I wouldnt use much, is very useful. I used to backfocus on the D7500 and then would remove my finger and recompose. I dont have to do that anymore. Further, shooting action shots requires access to different focusing systems, on the fly and with speed. Shots dont wait to be taken. Time is of the essence. I use 3D for tracking moving subjects and single or D25 for stationary subjects. This camera just works very well.

The controls are also well placed and there are so many options for customizing the controls. I also like the fact that I dont have to spin the left side dial to change from A, S, P and M and A. I just push a button and can set them easily. There are no gimmicky programs. There is also a custom option to allow you to just push the button and not have to keep holding it down and then spin the front or back dials on the right side of the top of the camera. I use this setting and it makes things easier for me. 

There are a lot of useful YouTube videos that outline some of these custom options. I suggest everyone purchasing the D500 to spend the time to view them. 

I do have a few complaints. The touchscreen doesnt work for moving around the the menu settings (it works for the photos review and other options). Dont know why Nikon doesnt write a software upgrade for this since the screen can do it. This is not a deal breaker since I can move around the custom settings pretty easily using the directional buttons. Yet, this should be addressed by Nikon.

The 10 FPS is amazing as is the buffer. I bought a super fast SD card that has a very large buffer and works well with 4k video. 

I dont like live view for video. The focus system is slow and hunts, casusing noise and some temporary blur. I havent used the video much but figure I will buy a tripod and a separate microphone that wont pick up the noise from my lenses looking for focus. However, the video quality is as advertisedoutstanding. 

I have held off purchasing the XQD card since I dont have a reader for it and my SD card is so fast. I will probably purchase one when the prices for a 64GB XQD card drops. It is a nice feature that the camera can write raw or video to one card and jpegs to the SD card. I know that some will want the XQD card so there is redundancy. However, I have never had an SD card fail and dont shoot professionally. A pro would want redundancy.

I wasnt sure whether I would like the battery grip but I have used it and its great. The camera can access that battery first, so you have two batteries in the camera. More importantly, you can shoot vertically and ithe grip has the same controls (joystick, separate back-focus button and shutter) that the camera has. So its really seamless to turn the camera, if there is a telephoto on it connected to a tripod, or to just turn it in your hand if hand-held.

Now a few thoughts about the 16-80 2.8 lens: I love this lens. I have both a 35 and 50mm prime lenses which are faster. However, they arent VR. I havent missed a shot indoors when I shot without a flash with the 16-80. The pictures are really impressive. Very sharp but also a beautiful creamy color and nice Bokah. I havent used the prime lenses much on this camera because the zoom is that good. The zoom lens is much heavier than the two prime lenses. So, I might use them if I take my external flash with me and want to reduce the total camera weight. I have used the 18-55 kit lens that came with the D7500. Thats a cheap lens and was better than I expected. It is also very light. However, the 16-80 is far superior in every respect. The extra range (effectively 24mm to 120mm) allows true wide angle and allows you to use it as a portrait lens. The Best Buy bundle for the D500, with battery grip and 16-80 2.8 lens is a really good deal.

I would caution anyone buying this camera that it is best in the hands of a photographer that is an enthusiast who will also shoot some action or wildlife photography. The controls require hours to truly understand and master. If someone is just looking for a great all-around camera that doesnt need all of the D500s capabilities, I would recommend the D7500 or D7200, both of which have the same less impressive autofocus system. The D7500 does shoot 4k and has a touch screen and is definitely an upgrade over the D7200. The D7500 also shares the D500s new metering system. 

But, I highly recommend this camera bundle if you have the money to spend and contemplate shooting wildlife, your kids soccer game or any action. The lack of a flash on the D500, which the less expensive Nikons have, is not a big deal to me since I never shoot a flash directly at a subject. 

So all in all, the D500 is probably the best DX camera out there today. It is so capable and customizable in the right hands. It is built like a tank and weather sealed. The touchscreen has amazing resolution and a better build quality than the cheaper Nikons. The superior resolution makes image review and zooming in on a focus point, a pleasure. You cant go wrong with the D500 and bundle."^5^Dec 2, 2017 9:59 PM
LojIQ^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-with-16-80mm-lens-black/4880600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^0^"My passion for photography fades in and out through the years, and recently it has been reignited primarily to capture as many moments for my 2 and 4 year olds as I can. I have gone through a Sony a6000, and Olympus OM-D E-M10 mark ii, and more recently a Nikon D7200. Sorry to say the mirrorless ones couldn't keep up with my needs and failed me either in low light or focus tracking. The D7200 was great while it worked, but about a month after purchase it had a shutter malfunction and I decided to return it while I still could. Enter the D500...
I actually almost gave up on Nikon. I was trying to find every reason to pick up a Canon since I still wasn't invested in any system, but on paper nothing came close to Nikon. Then it was the DX vs FX debate...I was SO close to getting the D750 since the price point is similar. However, in the end as much as I would have liked a full frame, the D500 won for a few reasons: I'm fine with DX format, and while FX would have been less of a gamble in low light, the D500 has a silly ISO range and actually delivers. Next, and probably my biggest concern right now, the D500 should be near future-proof. Lots of new Nikon tech made an appearance on this bad boy: New sensor, chip, autofocus, tilt and touch screen, 4k, Snapbridge, etc.... .I don't think I will be itching to pick up another body since everything on here should last a few years without feeling outdated ( I feel the D750 already is). As a matter of fact, the D7500 was just announced and I'm still glad I picked up the D500. A final factor for me was the pro/semi-pro body. This thing is a beast, and seems to be much better built than the D7200. The grip feels significantly better, performance is more than I could ask for, and overall I don't think many cameras out there can touch this (for me). 
The D500 has been excellent and I have really USED it in the few weeks I've had it. Low light performance is amazing, 10fps speaks for itself, and the autofocus takes everything my kids can throw at it. Lack of a pop-up flash is not a con for me as it does great without it, and when you have a camera like this you probably should have an external unit anyway. Battery life can drain quickly if you have it set to keep sending every photo you take to your phone, so you will need to keep that in mind (Airplane mode). 
The only thing I will say is that you should be comfortable with the fundamentals of photography before picking this up. I don't feel this is very suitable to most beginners. There is no 'auto' mode, or Scene settings...you get M, A, S, P and that's it. I guess you could keep it set to P, but in that case you are really wasting your money. It is highly customizable, with tons of features and lots of programmable settings and buttons, which is all a true waste if you are just using it for point and shoot. Otherwise, I think the D500 will bring a pleasant surprise to most people that pick it up. Regarding the price, that is of course a matter of perspective. Was it worth it for me? Definitely!"^5^Apr 16, 2017 5:50 PM
rickt183^/nikon-d500-dslr-camera-with-16-80mm-lens-black/4880600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^0^"I bought this body after the death of my D7000 in a car accident. This camera is far, FAR better than I expected it to be. I shoot candids in low light, meaning I need three things: high ISO performance, quick autofocus in low light, and a ton of speed. This camera delivers those things on a level I didn't think was possible. 

The autofocus of the d500 is a vast improvement over my d7000. I'm getting a ton more keepers than I did before - the days of yelling 'Just take the picture!!!' as the autofocus hunts are gone. I'm still getting used to it because there are low-light shooting situations where I normally wouldn't even bother to try that are now possibilities. I'm still shocked every time I use it. 

The ISO improvement is pretty insane, too. The reviews of useable 51k made me giggle a bit, but it's true! You really can do things with this body that you can't with others. Matched with my 50mm 1.4 I can pretty much shoot in the dark.

Overall I can't say enough good things. If this body is in your budget just do it. This is one of the rare times where the equipment really does matter- it's that much better than previous offerings from Nikon, and lets you get shots that weren't possible previously. If anything, you will get many more keepers with this body than you did before.

Downside- it costs a lot for a DX body, and it's heavy."^5^Aug 30, 2016 1:21 PM

1st- this camera has an incredible shutter speed with an AF system that outperforms any other Nikon of this caliber.

2nd- the low light performace is great. I do product photography and this feature lets me push the creative limits of this camera. 

3rd- the lens that comes with the kit is superb. It's an excellent all-around, everyday, option.

4th- I have a 500mm lens and the DX sensor provides quite a bit more reach. This is great for when I'm shooting sports. 

The only issue I have this this unit would be the lack of an 'Auto' setting. Not because I don't know how to shoot, but it would be nice if a co-worker could shoot pics if I'm not around.

Never have I imagined that I could be getting 100% keepers (technical-wise) shooting at 1/800 f/4 indoors. Color saturation, white balance (used fluorescent), flicker compensation, all worked great. Only thing that stinks (a little) is that my older non-AF-S (but constant F/2.8 and f/1.8) and newer slower than F/4 lenses can't make full use of the 99 cross sensors, so I got the kit lens and plan to get a f/4 or f/2.8 70-200 some day. 4K video looks decent on my 4K OLED TV - I haven't spent much time messing with video. I sweated over the decision to buy this for a very long time - life is truly too short to miss out on something so fun and capable.

The focus is 2nd to none and the 10 fps is great, but no matter what I did the pictures were not that great looking.
 The pictures seemed to lack that certain POP and the colors were off just ever slightly. I even tried several different lens, but nothing helped. 
 I really wanted to like the D500, but I was getting much better pictures with my old D7100.
 After a month of trying to get the D500 to perform as I wanted I finally gave up and returned it to Best Buy and bought a D750 and only after the 1st couple of pictures I found what I had been missing in the D500.

JerryMD^/nikon-d5600-dslr-video-camera-with-af-s-dx-nikkor-18-140mm-f-3-5-5-6g-ed-vr-lens-black/5715102?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^43^0^"My wife and I were looking for a quality DSLR without breaking the bank for an upcoming cruise and to capture the rest of our lives together and our research led us to the Nikon D5x00 series. 

If you made it this far, you are probably like me and found Nikon had a slightly updated version of the highly touted D5500, and while the differences are not massive, there are a few notable ones:

1) Snapbridge support offering NFC and Bluetooth connectivity on the D5600. 
2) Touch screen support of picture advance/scrubbing in review mode
3) Automatic time lapse feature, nice for capturing sunsets, day changes automatically
4) Slightly smaller body, but slightly higher weight

Otherwise, the features remain nearly identical, and we ended up choosing this over the Canon Rebel T6i/s competitors because it was smaller and did 1080p/60 video instead of 1080p/30. The difference in price over the older D5500 was only $100 more and it also offered the 18-140mm kit in a bundle while the D5500 did not, so we ended up buying the D5600 just as it came out via pre-order.

The main reason we ended up choosing this popular 18-140mm lens kit bundle was due to some research and youtube videos stating it was the best all-day carry type lens that gave some telephoto zoom, but also good results up close and in some lower light situations. Apparently, others came to similar conclusion since this kit is now showing as 'SOLD OUT'. We are looking forward to touring the Mediterranean with this camera in tow!

We also ended up getting the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G as well for an indoor low light and portrait prime lens, so while we will minimize the need to swap lenses outdoors, we will still swap to the 35mm indoors.

As for the camera itself, overall it performs very well but we haven't had a chance to really test it too much in the dead of winter. Snapbridge is still a bit quirky and annoyingly, does not auto-connect to the Wi-Fi on your phone, you have to manually navigate to it each time to use the phone control feature. We ended up buying the handheld remote instead to simplify the process.

Some negatives of the kit itself, it is very sparse. There is no hood or lens bag included. The battery doesn't even come charged. There also isn't an SD card included, even a tiny one that would let you get shooting right away, so make sure to have one beforehand. I noticed some of the older camera kits included these kinds of things.

We bought a couple extra batteries, and a Lowe Pro Slingshot 250 bag to store everything using BestBuy's 25% off combo, as well as a few filters, 67mm UV for protection and 67mm polarized for outdoor bright glare shooting. Overall very happy with the camera and everything we purchased so far, we'll be sure to test it out more in the future!"^5^Jan 26, 2017 10:56 PM

Took a little getting used to because some of the controls are a little different, but I like it. My old 18mm-55mm lens aggravated me because I was switching it out very often for the 55mm-300mm lens. With this 18mm-140mm lens the need to switch lenses is greatly reduced, but the tradeoff is that this lens is heavier. The camera itself is lighter than my old 5300, so it's really not much different other than now I have to pay closer attention to keep from bumping my lens when I'm in crowded places or climbing on and off rides (ex: Disney World). Overall I think it is worth it to avoid having to switch lenses as often. The picture quality from this camera is wonderful. I've had more than a few people comment on my photos asking if I was a professional."^5^May 23, 2017 3:07 PM

We upgraded to a couple higher end lenses and the images these cameras take with them are incredible! The auto mode is nice if you want to just open the camera and start shooting but the manual mode gives you much more control and flexibility. It is easy to learn on and the controls and menus are very customizable. We were both amateurs when we got these and I think they are not only great to learn on but they'll cover a lot of our needs as our skills progress as well so we won't need to upgrade for a long time."^5^May 25, 2018 5:55 PM

I do notice a big difference from the older model. I bought mine with the 18-140mm lens. When it says 18mm it means from a distance. It does not like it if I want really up close photos and I'm already sitting up close.

Its compact, lightweight, easy to handle. On the photography side being a beginner, I cannot find anything fishy in the camera as it does its job perfectly fine.

Couple of things I found it difficult in using this camera,

1. Snapbridge connectivity is not fluent, often taken time to establish connection. It also drains up your mobile and camera battery. For best result, use this feature when are around with power source. Try using Remote Shutter Release devices if you are interested only in taking photos remotely.

As a wildlife photographer, that feature was difficult to pass up. Not only that, but the write speed to the card is also fast. Just for giggles, I held the shutter button down to see how long it would shoot continuously before buffering. After a 30 seconds I released the shutter and it still hadn't buffered. It would have gone longer than that, but 30 seconds was proof enough for me. 

I upgraded to this camera from the Canon T6s, which had a touch screen, and other really nice features that this camera doesn't have. which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Granted, this particular model is three years old, I'm sure the next iteration will have a touch screen. In the meantime, I'll have to be satisfied using the multi-controller.

I shoot outdoors predominantly, and don't do much studio work, which is where the Wi-Fi adapter would have come in handy, but it's still a nice feature to have. I simply don't have the need to use my phone or tablet to control the camera.

The GPS feature is also very cool, because with the software I use, I can show people exactly where a particular shot was taken using Google Maps or Google Earth. Just remember to turn the GPS feature off when storing your camera or it will murder your battery!

Once you get it set right the results are incredible but it can be an extremely frustrating road to that point. If you can find the Sony a77ii 4d focusing book online it is helpful, you have to search as it is not readily available through Sony, strange huh?

Instead of using Macbeth Color charts or other measurement tools, I just took it into the field and shot landscapes and scenics (what I do). It is incredibly sharp and detailed. I photographed some flowers without a macro lens and cropped them. Beautifully detailed images. I have the 5DSR, and I do not see any moire patterns. I tested some low light pictures, and I did see some noise in the shadows like other Canon cameras. However, I HDR'd the same images and created stunning files. Shooting at f22, I experienced the same type of diffraction as with any camera. So, the optimum apertures are still in the f8 to f11 areas. I only shoot raw, so I cannot say how it handles jpegs. I processed my images in Lightroom CC. Because of the image sizes, I noticed a very slight slow down in processing but nothing inconvenient. I used both Photomatix and Lightroom CC to process HDR. The processing time was slower but not intolerable. Overall, I have the same thrill of when I went from 35mm to 2 1/4 back in the film days. This is a bigger jump. I have a 5D Mark II. I would say this camera is equivalent to going from a 2 1/4 to a 4X5. You have the flexibility of shooting handheld. I am excited that Canon made this move..."^5^Oct 9, 2015 10:57 AM

(1) it's like having an extra lens because you can crop very tight and still have a perfect image. I shot sports a lot and my clients always ask how do I get tight shots. This is my secret. 

(2) More editing power! the ISO on this camera is low, but not really. Because there's so much detail, you can pull so much detail from shadows it's amazing. Very low noise and if there's some, when you increase the luminance or any noise tricks...it's changing very tiny pixels compared to bigger chunks. 

(3) Down sampling improves picture quality. It's the same logic of video ppl recording in 4K to downsample to 1080p. 

Negatives:

(1) 5fps is slow...I wish it was at least 7fps.

(2) 50mp means every file is at least 50mb. That's a lot of data, so get a fast CF card. 

(3) Video is cool, but I wish there was at least 60fps for 1080p.

At ISO 100 it is the ultimate landscape and nature camera. I have used it for bald eagles in flight and landscapes in the Rockies and it is stellar for both. At 4.5 frames per second it won't replace my 1DX for birds in flight, but as a second camera with a short lens on, it will replace my 7D II.

Aim and fire and you can be assured of a flawless 12fps experience. The focus speed is blinding fast and accurate with more choices than you can count. The Jpeg engine of Sony has FINALLY been improved. You'll be tempted to shoot more in Jpeg than before as details are better retained without the characteristic Sony 'smudging'. The Viewfinder and LCD are simply 'state of the art' good. The build is all magnesium, light but like a brick strong and weather sealed. The shear choices in custom setup assure you of it being just as you want it when you want it with custom memory setting provided as well. It is NOT a high ISO monster however. It's strong suits are without a doubt ISO50-ISO1600, Once you reach ISO3200 if you are viewing 100% on screen, however in print it's just fine. ISO 12800 is pretty bad from there on up, but most cameras are. It is a great professionally qualified tool. I feel it would easily keep up with a Canon 5DMkIII in all aspects other than high ISO.

I upgraded from a Rebel T4i which actually to me was not that great a camera. It lacked a lot of extra features and just everyday functionality that I required and I am by no means a professional photographer. This camera is first off a lot heavier piece of gear than the Rebel series and has every bell and whistle you could imagine. It lacks a flip out back screen and Wifi but I do not find any of those features useful, in fact I purchased an Eye-Fi card which gives this camera Wifi functionality anyway.

Not being a professional but not wanting a point and shoot camera and loving the DSLR functions, I wanted the best and this certainly gives Nikon and all other DSLRs a run for the money. It is a bit to get used to, however it resembles other Canon models with similar buttons and menus. The one feature I do love is the speed and also the 65 point auto focus which also blows away the 70D 16 point auto focus. Pictures come out crisp and clear and with 18-135mm lens is beautiful. Just understand this is a big camera and does not look like any of the Rebel series or the S1 and is even bigger than the 70D. However it is well protected with a serious outside housing and is also weather resistant which is also a nice feature.

The first version of the 7D could only be manually focused in video mode, which often put audible noise into the video and was almost always inaccurate.

Great color rendition, silent zoom and focus with 18-135mm STM kit lens - particularly good again for videos. Pro-level sealing against dust and water. Cropped sensor (1.6 multiple of full-frame lens focal lengths) is especially good for sports and wildlife, but nothing is lost for great portraits or landscapes. A 50mm prime lens on this camera gives similar results as a much more expensive 85mm portrait lens on a full frame camera.

All 65 focus points are cross type and the center point is also diagonal type. This allows you to selectively focus on subjects near the frame's edges. Even the 5D Mark III has only 45 cross type of its 61 total focus points. The previous version 7D had on 19 focus points and the more expensive (full-frame) 6D has on 11 focus points.

The menu system is identical to 5D Mark III including 6 focusing cases (options) to ignore or include objects coming into your view that might otherwise interfere with your subject. Focus cases also allow tracking of subjects that make quick and unpredictable movements.

Although the 7D Mark II does not have a touch screen for quicker focusing in Live View, it does have silent focusing in video mode using the touch pad surrounding the Quick Control Dial.

This camera has 252 metering zones versus the original 7D's 63. It also has a 150,000-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor vs. a 100,000-pixel sensor on the Canon 1DX that costs almost 4 times more!

1080p videos can be made at 60 fps so that slow motion playback at 30 fps is smooth. Not even the 5D Mark III can do that!

The low light is absolutely incredible. The original 7D lens had several known issues. Lens creep if you purchased the camera with the lens was a nightmare. The third original 7D that I received didn't have any, but the first two were awful. The 7D Mark II has a lens lock which solves this problem. The original 7D had a serious overheating issue when shooting video. The 7D Mark II now has SD and so far hasn't shown overheating issues when shooting longer videos and saving to the SD. In video mode the 7D Mark II now has the ability to auto focus and can be set to focus on a subject in the cameras view. The original 7D didn't have this feature. The only two negative things would be that they should have integrated Wi-Fi and SD UHS-II. The 7D Mark II is an amazing camera and the improvements make it well worth the pricing difference between the two."^5^Dec 8, 2014 4:22 PM

The 7D mkII is a great choice for someone who is comfortable shooting in manual mode and is looking to upgrade. While it is a crop sensor camera it can compete with the higher end Canon full frame sensor models at a lower cost.
Having a shot rate of 10fps makes this camera great for shooting sports, wildlife and other situations where one needs to keep up with the action. I have gotten some very nice shots of birds in flight that would have been difficult to capture with the 60D and its slower fps.
The autofocus works well in keeping a moving target in focus when using ai servo and back button AF.
The lens that comes with the camera is good for a kit lens, all of the pictures I have taken with this lens are sharp and clear.
One other thing I have noticed is that this camera has a much quieter shutter than the 60D, while this may be nit picking and irrelevant to some, it was something I noticed from the start.
Overall I think it's a very good camera and a good choice for someone looking to upgrade without the expense of a full frame sensor camera."^5^Jan 30, 2016 6:29 AM

I was really torn, because the video features are really nice! Plus, there are a lot of pro-grade elements on the camera - dual card slots, clean hdmi out, weather-proofing, etc. The dual-pixel autofocus system is amazing for doing live autofocus during filming, and the video image quality is very good. AND I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt on still photo quality. I upgraded glass to Canon's L series lenses to see just what the camera was capable of. However, I had also tried those lenses on a Canon 6D full-frame camera, and that camera and lenses were amazing! I could NOT get those same results with the 7DMII. I could get good results with 7DMII, but not the amazing results that I get from 6D. Overall, I'd say this is a very good camera, especially for videographers, but if you're going to spend this much money, I'd recommend going with 6D instead."^4^Feb 8, 2015 10:19 PM

I read several other reviews on various sites with the same issue, so decided to exchange it for a new one. It appears to be an isolated problem, but is disheartening if you end up with one of the lemons. Since exchanging the camera the new one has a much higher keeper rate.

For example, the focusing capabilities are exceptional in this camera. However, there are five different focusing modes and you can flip between them while you are shooting.

All manual controls are right at your fingertips and you can even turn on a full Heads Up Display in the viewfinder for everything, so no longer do I have to look at the LCD screen while adjusting my F-stops, apertures, or ISO's. The auto-focus is instant and the quality is superb. It has two card slots (CF and SD).

It has served us well since then and still is a great camera. Purchasing the 7D Mk II was a no-brainer upgrade from our original 7D.

Some of the nice upgrades include:

-Built in GPS for geotagging photos and/or logging trips.
-Greatly improved AF.
-Now has 10 fps burst mode (the original 7D had 8 fps).
-Improved video features, including a headphone jack for monitoring audio during recording
-Dual card slots (one for CF and one for SD). This makes using a wifi SD card possible without an SD to CF adapter if you want cheap wifi.
-New dial around the joystick that by default changes AF modes, but can be programmed to other functions if you want.
-Improved ISO performance over the original 7D.

The one con I would have against this camera is the lack of onboard wifi. While I understand the metal casing on the camera reduced wifi performance, the only way to add official wifi is with a pretty expensive external wifi device (upwards of $700). You can, of course, use a SD wifi card for transferring files, but it does not allow remote shooting like the official wifi adapter."^5^Jul 9, 2015 12:28 PM

At the end, 'full frame' is not my priority and I like the 7D Mark ii's sensors and price more :) Before this I've been using 450D which is a much lower model, so I can see huge differences in focusing and camera's sensors.

This camera received rave reviews.  After the newer model came out a couple of months before my trip, I thought about purchasing it but it seemed to get bad reviews about its auto-focus ability and everyone said this older model was better.  So, about 10 days before departing on the trip, I ordered this camera bundle from Best Buy.  As you will learn later, this was a horrible purchase.

Before I review the camera itself, let me start by saying this is the most pathetic tripod I have ever used.  I did not take my older tripod because this one was smaller and I assumed it functioned like every other tripod I have used.  Boy was I surprised when I tried to attach the camera to the tripod to take a picture in a 'vertical' orientation.  The swivel head only swivels maybe 45 degrees to the side and therefore you can never use this tripod to take a 'vertical' picture.  This seems completely stupid.  Almost every time I needed a tripod, it was for a vertical shot so I completely regretted not discovering this before I left home.  If you never need to take a vertical shot, this tripod is fine but I fail to see the point of making a tripod that isn't able to take a vertical shot. 

Now on to the review of the camera.  Before leaving home, I took a couple of shots with the camera to make sure I could show my husband the basics of using this camera as he would be the primary user of it.  The camera worked fine.  Once we arrived in Hawaii, we took a couple of pictures that evening before going to bed and once again the camera worked fine.  The first full day of our trip was the first day the camera would really get used to take multiple shots in multiple situations.  That morning we had booked a tour to take us around to different locations used in the TV show Hawaii 5-0.  We had been on the tour for a couple of hours and were in the van riding to the next destination when I heard the camera make a clicking noise.  I looked over at the camera in my husband's hands and the lens was retracting itself back into the body of the camera.  He showed me the screen and it said 'lens error' before the camera went off.  He tried turning the camera back on and the same clicking noise and error occurred.  We had to finish the tour without the use of this camera.  I took the battery out of the camera and after returning to the hotel room we decided to try the camera again.  After reading online to try to focus the camera on the floor as you turn it on, I tried this and the camera magically began to work again---for 5 days---and then the error happened again.  This time, we were taking a 'selfie' using the camera and the clicking noise happened again.  I tried taking the battery out of the camera for a while and focusing on the floor again.  This time, the camera kept giving the error.  Then, I tried turning the camera on and immediately trying to zoom.  This allowed the camera to stay on.  However, as soon as I tried taking a picture and barely touched the zoom, the same clicking noise and the same lens error occurred.  I called Canon technical support and the representative did not seem surprised at all when I told her what had happened.  She said the only thing to do was to send the camera back to Canon and they would send me a new camera.  She said they do not even fix cameras with this error they just replace them.  I explained that I was on a 3 week trip to Hawaii and still had 2 weeks left in the trip and now would have no camera but that didn't matter.  I was given no other options.  So, for the last 2 weeks of our 3 week trip, this camera became not so affectionately referred to as 'the brick'.  Every now and then I would try 'the brick' again to see if I could get it to work but it never worked again on the trip.  When we got home from the trip, I tried the camera again and it still did not work.  Because of the Christmas season, it took me a few days to get the camera packaged up and sent back to Canon.  Just before I packed it up, I tried it one more time.  Guess what?!  It worked.  I tried it several more times for a few days and it continued to work.  I called Canon back and explained this to them and they said to go ahead and send it back to them even though it was currently working.  I have not received any communication back from them yet but that is because of the New Year's Holidays.  I really hope they don't just send me back 'the brick'.  However, no matter what they send me, I will always be afraid that the next shot will be the one that gives me this error.  The other thing is, if the camera had not 'fixed itself' on the first day of my trip, I was still within my return window at Best Buy and there was a Best Buy location on Oahu where I was.  By the time the camera broke again 5 days later, I was on an island that did not have a Best Buy location.  I regret not taking it back to Best Buy on Oahu but who wants to spend a valuable day of their vacation dealing with a problem on a very expensive piece of brand new equipment that should have worked out of the box, especially when it is working again?

The bottom line is I still don't know what Canon's resolution to this problem will be and even if they replace the camera, I will definitely never take it as my only camera on a trip.  I really wish I could just return the camera because I will never have confidence in it after this experience.  I had bought this camera based on reviews but also based on the fact that I had a very old Canon Camera that worked great for years.  I was loyal to the brand but I will not be loyal to Canon anymore.  They have broken my trust.  I explained to the first Canon representative that I bought this camera because I didn't just want to use my phone to take pictures on my trip.  I wanted to use a real camera.  The lesson I learned is that I would have been better off using the money this camera cost to buy one of the newest iPhone models which would have taken excellent pictures and never given me a lens error.  It's gotten harder and harder to find 'real cameras' since the advent of the camera phone.  Perhaps Canon should think about the reason for the decline in sales is because of dependability!!!  And, perhaps you should think long and hard before you spend this kind of money on a BRICK!"^1^Jan 2, 2020 11:01 AM

Spending $700.00( tax included) in order to expect a new creator camera kit, but when I first opened it, the tripod's box already cut, opened and used. Exactly like the last time I bought the GPS, the accessories were used( I can't use cause they can't stick anymore, so need to exchange it) So I am wondering about my canon g7x mark ii.

Although the video on this camera is very good, I am not a vlogger and I am writing this review from a casual photographers point of view. I wanted a new camera and wasn't sure I was ready for a DSLR. I've had other point-and-shoot cameras that were 'OK'. The main problem I had was shooting in low light without streaks or other artifact. Enter the Powershot G7X MII. This camera fits the bill. Even on full auto, pictures are amazing in daylight and night scenes. Great color and sharpness. This camera also has many manual settings that I have started to play with and learned how to improve the quality in different situations. It shoots RAW and JPEG and you can shoot both simultaneously. It's a little more than I though I would spend on a point-and-shoot camera but with an f1.8-f2.8 lens with a 1' sensor I am not having buyers remorse. This camera is fantastic! I've seen other reviews about battery life being mediocre. I can say I have not had this problem. I bought another genuine Canon battery to have on hand but so far I haven't had to use it."^5^Aug 23, 2016 11:27 PM

It really is one of the absolute best cameras I have ever owned, I decided I wanted a point and shoot camera for the times when I just didn't want to carry my full size camera. SO, I started doing some research to find one that would satisfy me. I am only an amateur photographer, but I won't settle for less than the best. The end result was a comparison between the Sony RX100 and this Canon G7X. So, I went to Best Buy to actually try them both. To hold them in my hands and play with them a little. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how the Sony was rated so highly. My personal comparison showed the canon to be FAR superior in many ways. One of the reasons the Sony reviews rated it highly was due to it having an pop up view finder. I tried it.....and it is so flimsy and fragile that I was afraid I would break it. The Canon doesn't have this feature, but is manufactured so well that It's an engineering wonder. I urge you to take a very close look at this G7X before making a final buying decision. It's so well built.....I just cannot find the words to do it justice. And the features that is does have? Wow! I love the fact that us will shoot raw photos. I love the auto focus feature that keeps the moving part of your picture in focus. I love the beautiful touch screen and the way the screen folds out. I love the built in wireless and how well it works. The locations of the controls and the ease of operation. I could go on and on about this camera. And, it costs quite a bit less than the Sony. I've had this G7X for a couple of months now and am so happy with it that I'd strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a really good point and shoot camera with features that you usually only see on a full size DSLR. No.....it wont replace the full size DSLR, and you can still do far more with the full size DSLR. But, if your looking for a point and shoot that will satisfy you when you don't have your DSLR, here it is,..... It doesn't zoom as much as I'd like, or get you in as close as a DSLR with a zoom lens, but that is about the only real disadvantage I can find on this camera. But within the normal range of this lens it can't be beat. If you need to be able to shoot pictures that are at a distance, and bring them close........then you may not be so happy with the G7X. But hey, there is no single camera that does it all, is there? They all have their pro's and con's. But if you need image stabilization, excellent auto focus, fast FPS, and the ability to shoot in the raw format...and great built in wireless....This is by far the best choice for a point and shoot. Don't take my word for it. Go to your local camera store and compare it to the Sony and You will see what I'm talking about."^5^Jul 22, 2017 5:24 PM

After that, it was 'sold out online' until June 18th(today). I love this camera, it has all the function that I need. I was planning to get the G7X two weeks before this camera came out, but finally heard this one is releasing, so I decided to wait for the upgrade. It is a very easy to use camera for beginning. The only thing bothers me is the battery cover, it doesn't close when u push it back to close, you have to use both hands to close the battery cover. other than that, I love this camera and I will use it for more videos for my vlogs."^5^Jun 19, 2016 4:30 AM
katnv^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-20-1-megapixel-digital-video-camera-black/5015000?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^36^0^"We began purchasing Canon Powershot cameras back in 2003 with the A series and have been through six - upgrading each along the way. In general, we love the Powershots and how well they hold up. I take a lot of pictures and have taken in excess of 75,000 pictures on each of the cameras before we upgrade. 

Prior to this purchase we were using the G15 and I didn't think it could get any better, but the G7 Mark II has completely impressed me. Out of the box, it is smaller and lighter than the G15 and other Powershots that came before. I have been a fan of the flip and twist LCD but I realize it adds bulk. The new flip up design of this LCD is surprisingly useful and they still managed to package it into a smaller case. 

In general, the shooting options seem identical to the prior versions but seem more accessible as they are easily selected either by dial or touchscreen. There are also some great bonus features like face recognition with identification that allows for data to be imprinted into the file for future searching. 

As I have come to expect from Canon, the picture quality stands out. I have especially been impressed at the low light capabilities. In fact, I am learning to 'trust' the camera more and more as I play around with situations in which I would expect to need a flash and yet the camera doesn't indicate the need. You virtually always get a better picture when you don't have to rely upon a flash and this camera allows you to to get those pictures more often. 

In summary, I highly recommend the G7 Mark II to anyone looking for the convenience of a point and shoot but still wanting the ability to create high quality photos."^5^Nov 18, 2016 6:50 PM

This is the perfect camera to travel with. I recently took it on a trip where I visited a lot of museums and insides of churches (low light environments). I took about 5000 pictures! It worked very well in low light situations and captured images that I could not have gotten with other cameras since it goes down to a 1.8 aperture. (I think my Rebel with its kit lens would not have been able to capture the pictures that I took with this little camera.) It worked great in the sun, too. It has a special scene mode called 'hand-held night' that captured beautiful night images--even through a bus window while moving. I found the battery life to be very good. I have it set to ECO mode in the menu. I brought 4 batteries with me, but never needed more than 2 batteries in a day. It is small enough to fit in my fanny pack or shoulder bag yet has a good solid feel. The only thing missing is a panorama mode. I mostly left it on Auto or P mode and had peace of mind knowing it was probably going to get the shot. It had trouble with selfies--either the person or the background would be out of focus. You can fix this by putting it on Av mode and picking a small aperture. It cost a lot of money, but well worth it."^5^Jul 7, 2017 10:51 PM
CMCM^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-20-1-megapixel-digital-video-camera-black/5015000?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^20^2^"After a lot of research and consideration looking at all the small, pocket-purse sized cameras available and what they offered, to my own surprise, I ended up choosing the G7XII. I started my search by liking everything about the more expensive G1XIII EXCEPT for that high price I wanted a zoom that went to 100 or more rather than 72, and I especially wanted the faster f/1.8-2.8 lens because I wanted to shoot in some low light interiors in particular during an upcoming vacation. I didn't initially like the G7XII because I wanted a viewfinder and had previously decided I would not buy another compact camera without one, but the G7XII had enough great features I wanted now compared to all the other cameras available that I broke down and got it as I was about to leave on vacation recently. I have mostly been very pleased with this camera, more so than I anticipated. The focus and exposure are almost always spot on for the scene and light I've shot in, which ranged from low light interiors to late day shots, sunsets, and sunny day landscapes. Focus is reasonably fast, although DPAF would be better! In fact, this camera is so good I got lazy and ended up mostly shooting on auto just to make things easy. The G7XII allows you to concentrate on composition instead of fiddling around with various settings. I'm not a big video shooter, but I did a few short videos and the video capability is quite good and enough for my needs. (I don't care at all about 4K video). I played around with digital zoom a couple of times, and it's barely passable if not zoomed out too far, but not good enough to use unless you absolutely have to. I especially like the touch screen functions, and the tilt screen came in very useful a few times so I'm glad to have that. The LCD screen is large, bright and clear. To my surprise, I found I didn't especially miss the viewfinder except in a few overly bright light situations. That said, I'd still rather have a viewfinder (as with the next G5X or G1XIII). The menus are very good and quick to access, also very intuitive. The G7XII is probably heavier than some other small cameras, but it has a beautiful, solid build that I really like. Despite its small size, it feels like a real camera and not a toy. Unlike many small Canon (and other brand) cameras, it has a nice little grip on it so it's not a slippery bar of soap like so many tiny cameras. Overall, I don't regret my purchase although I do hope Canon makes future improvements to this very popular camera or perhaps to the G5X (needs a bigger sensor perhaps, newer processor)."^4^Jun 22, 2018 10:08 PM

Skydivetr^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-20-1-megapixel-digital-video-camera-black/5015000?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^3^"This camera DOES NOT use dual pixel AF or any other phase detect AF system in it. Manage your autofocus expectations accordingly. Especially in low light and in video. However, it does have a noticeable improvement in speed over its predecessor and for most situations it's fine.
What this camera excels at, just like its predecessor, is stills. It has excellent low and mid ISO image quality. I prefer the Fine Detail setting as my picture style as it provide excellent sharpness and punchy, great-looking colors by default. But there are a number of other picture styles to suit your tastes. I also love that this camera now has in camera raw processing, which can be useful.It seems also like Canon has quietly made some improvements to the lens because it seems a bit sharper than the one on the G7X even though they are supposed to be the same.
Video quality is also excellent and quite sharp. The autofocus is pretty good but because it's contrast detect, you will see a little bit of back and forth motion with the focus from time but otherwise it's not bad. Great for casual uses such as vlogging.
The camera controls are well laid-out. I like the chunkier grip and that the exposure comp dial has better feedback to it. The one its predecessor could be a little hard to turn (but kudos to Canon for at least including one - Sony RX100 has no such dial on top). The LCD is bright and clear and also is more flexible, which means it's a lot easier to compose on in bright sunlight. Battery life is not stellar but once again, this also an improvement over the original G7X. It should last you a day of shooting.
Complaints? I think the major one is, and this seems to be an issue on both the G7X and the RX100 series cameras, is that dust can easily get inside the lens. Even though the camera has a built-in automatic lens cap, it does a poor job at keeping dust and other particles out. 

But overall, a great enthusiast compact camera. The 1' Sony sensor inside is still relatively small compared to APSC rebels or mirrorless but it punches above its weight in image quality. If you really don't see yourself going much beyond the kit lens if you were to buy a Rebel, this could be a great alternative. It takes great photos and video, has improved AF and battery life over the original, and it comfortable to shoot with."^5^Mar 25, 2018 4:26 PM

It's a worthy replacement for my old Canon G12 that served me well for many years, although the G7X Mark II is a bit smaller and lighter (which isn't a bad thing), I tried both this and the Canon Powershot G5X, and in the end, I kept the G7X Mark II and returned the G5X. Nothing really wrong with the G5 X, but I felt the G7X was superior for my needs and preferences, particularly low light indoor action shots (basketball). I also think the G7X produces richer tones and colors - more of the Canon 'pop' with high saturation that I prefer. These differences were very subtle, but those were the deciding factors for me personally. Both cameras are great though, and it really just comes down to preference. If you prefer an actual viewfinder, then the G5X is the camera for you... I will also add that Best Buy handled the refund / exchange for me flawlessly, with a smile! Great service - thank you! Also, as a side note - this camera works for my needs for low light indoor action shots (my son's basketball games), BUT any compact camera like this has limited focusing capabilities in such a setting - you won't get the same results as a true DSLR in that type situation. However, you also don't have all the heavy bulk to haul around! In most other cases (outdoor action shots and portrait photography), this camera will rival even a true DSLR in quality - it's an awesome travel camera for even a pro!!! I've had it for 2 months now and LOVE IT!!!!"^5^Apr 12, 2017 4:09 PM

Leebo^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-20-1-megapixel-digital-video-camera-black/5015000?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I originally purchased a mirrorless DSLR as I am going on a trip later this year, but after evaluating the package decided to go with this camera instead. This was due to smaller size for travel, previous reviews and performance. The camera does not possess a electronic viewfinder, but for what I am going to use it for it should be fine. Also note that the camera does NOT have the ability to be water resistant nor is the lens protected when the camera is open. If you want to use it wet weather or even underwater there is an optional external case you can buy from Canon but it is expensive. A better option if you are going to use it outdoors is the Canon GX3 which is weatherproof but an older camera and is more expensive and is quite a bit larger. The lens protection problem can be accomplished with a lens filter adapter from Lensmate and a UV filter mounted on it. The adapter and 3 filters is available in a kit and is around $55. Do this to protect your lens, but it does add some thickness to the camera (livable). Better to destroy a UV filter than your lens!.Overall a great camera so far and takes great pictures, allows many of the manual controls that the less expensive point and shoots do not have, but is also a good beginner camera as it basically is a point and shoot out of the box. A big bang for the dollar! I have not had this camera long, so the long term jury is out, but so far, so good!"^5^Feb 2, 2019 8:49 AM

Overall, it's a good camera. The image quality is great in good lighting, but the amount of noise in higher ISO images is a bit disappointing. It's auto-focus is fairly quick, but sometimes it doesn't lock the first time. It has a good zoom range for a compact camera, and the lens quality is good.

I took pictures and video in a variety of lighting conditions. It does very well for shooting video in low-light, and is a very impressive camera in this regard.

On day 2, I noticed that the camera had a hot pixel while shooting video. Ultimately, I returned the camera for this flaw, so I did not have much of an opportunity to test it beyond a few days. I could not find an option in the menu to remap the hot pixel. The time I did spend with it was a pleasure, and it was a good camera. 

The image colors are true to Canon, and embody the warmth that Canon is known for. If the still images were sharper in lower lighting conditions and if it did not have the hot pixel during video, I would have kept the camera."^4^Nov 26, 2016 12:15 PM

So Why No 5 Star Rating You Ask?? Simple. 3 Major Points. 
- This Canon is NOT capable of 4K video.
- The Battery life is sub-par IMO (pick up a couple of extras batteries)
- The Mic is in a less-than-ideal location. The natural position for holding the camera tends to cover up the mic. So avoid temptation, pay attention and refrain from natural instincts.. in time your muscle memory will kick in and you'll get use to it."^4^Jan 30, 2017 1:01 AM

The daylight pictures are practically indistinguishable from from my 5D mk3 photos printed at 13 x 19. But there is a fair amount of noise at lower light levels beyond ISO 800. I cant really comment on the JPEG quality since I shoot almost exclusively in RAW. The video is good, but the microphone leaves much to be desired. My only real complaint is the battery life. While it will last all day shooting stills, it really runs down fast when shooting video. I had to buy an extra battery while on vacation to keep from missing shots near the end of the day because of a dead battery."^4^Nov 30, 2018 4:37 PM

It's also a treat that the lowest aperature can be shot at 1.8 and 2.8 for your bokeh-hunters. I was a bit discouraged not having a viewfinder, but the LCD screen actually works for me. It's also touch enabled and if you're not use to that, the dials are easy to adjust and get around with. Photo quality is amazing as well!

The adjustable frame rate for time laps was the big pusher for me buying this camera and it was well worth it, excellent on par quality. The only negative was that it does not contain an external mic port which is the only somewhat bad thing, but the mic is very persistent. To give an idea I was recently filming a 1980 camera fully stocked out at 650 horse power being revved up inside of a garage, to us it was loud and beautiful, thinking that the mic will be blurted, after reviewing footage it picked up what could be used as a sound clip dub over for movies. so the sound was on par. The camera does have weight to it and once you hold it you will understand why, it's very strong feeling being made out of almost all metal. This camera does have a variety of different functions/features on it which would be better explained through best buy or the canon website or youtube. I always do my research on an electronic item before buying, I had reviewed over a hundred cameras for 8 months and kept leaning towards the canon g7x mark ii. Definitely check it you do your research and come into the store to see it first hand. Also to add the camera stabilizer (if your walking the shot will keep it steady vs shaking) is incredible. I use a car mount and this keeps pretty straight and steady on gravel, highways etc. also great for using your time lapse feature. It's well worth every penny, I worked a lot of overtime to afford this camera and I do not regret it."^5^Mar 13, 2017 1:22 PM

I'm very happy with the image quality and overall build of the camera. It feels exceptional. So far, I'm not disappointed at all at the higher end price for what it still basically a point and shoot. But the 1' sensor and 1.8-2.8 lens perform very well and that alone has made the increased price worth it in my mind. Where I am fairly disappointed is the battery life. I had read many reviews knocking the battery but I just didn't realize how poor this Canon battery is with this camera compared to every other Canon I've owned. I've read a little and I'm hoping that after a few more charge cycles I will see a little improvement. I just purchased another Canon battery at nearly $50, only because I won't be able to get even a half day shooting with just one battery.

The camera has a lot of features that allow for manual operations. I would consider this a point and shoot on steroids or an entry level dslr in a point and shoot frame. For that reason, it was the only reason I gave this review 2 stars. 
The problems I encountered were with the auto focus setting. The auto-focus pictures were hit and miss-50% of the photos were blurry or focused on something in the back ground. Have I gotten used to my iPhone camera-perhaps.


As for a whistle item-The wifi was pure crap. It never worked, I was never able to transfer a photo from the camera to any of the 3 wireless options-email, cell or cloud folder. I would never judge the quality of camera based on it's wifi performance but in this case, it just added to my frustrations. It's not that the wifi feature was clunky to use, it just did not work period.

Canon has tried to separate itself from the very small crowd by giving the G7 X a longer lens, selfie-friendly LCD, and dedicated exposure compensation dial.

pauldar^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^80^21^"At the tender age of thirty-five (1978) I purchased my very first Polaroid Land Camera. Oh my! It was the SX-70, Foldable Polaroid Land, Polarsonic Autofocus Model 2 camera. What FUN. It was the very first, Instamatic-film-camera for me and I thoroughly enjoyed using it. I took hundreds of FUN pics of my family and friends, and, also as photographic evidence of just how large that fish I caught actually was. So, when I had the opportunity to evaluate a complimentary, Polaroid OneStep2, I jumped at the chance to re-live those nostalgic memories of over forty years ago in exchange for an honest and comprehensive review.

The Polaroid Originals - OneStep 2 Viewfinder Analog Instant Film Camera is a very simple instamatic camera to operate. Maybe a little too simple in my world. I was able to take pictures, out-of-the-box, within ten minutes including loading a film pack in the camera. However, it took me over five rolls of color film to finally get the same caliber of developed analog pictures I was once familiar with so many years ago. I was ready to 'give-up', but still wanted to love this type of camera. Then, I began meticulously pouring over the directions and soon realized that there were certain steps that had to be followed to the letter for bang-up photos. This I-Type film is not inexpensive when used as haphazardly as I did at first, wasting much of it. Fortunately for me, my local Best Buy had an ample supply of I-Type Color Film in stock. I got overconfident because I had a Polaroid back in the late 70's, which I thought, made me an 'experienced' user. No way! Most of my prints had that washed-out look because I did NOT keep the developing print safely out of the light. So, first, let me make one important point about the Polaroid OneStep2  Immediately after taking a photo, plunge the developing print into total darkness as is available while it is still under the film shield. I started to carry an old black camera bag around with me every time I used this Polaroid OneStep2. It is not only handy for carrying the camera and film, but most importantly, provides a dark space to keep the ejected film print from being exposed to light (see attached pics). Remember that 'light' is your friend while taking photos with the camera. But, because of the light sensitivity of the film, 'light' becomes your enemy while the print is developing. The Polaroid OneStep2 is an analog instamatic camera, which gives you sharp and clear, color, or, black and white, finished, developed prints. As long as you take the time to follow all the steps necessary to take great photos in the first place. It is NOT a digital camera like the ones on your Smart Phone measured in megapixels with preview and edit functions. The Polaroid OneStep2 gives you an instant print that you can actually touch and feel and share immediately with family and friends.

*** After more then two weeks of use and five rolls of film, this is what I found to be strategic in getting the best quality photos from this Polaroid OneStep2: ***

* User Manual  Thoroughly read the User Manual and become familiar with the 'mechanics' of taking quality analog, instamatic photos. 
* Polaroid Website  At 'Support' there is a link to 'How to get the most out of Polaroid Originals film'. It details many important items like proper storage of film, camera roller maintenance, temperature, exposure compensation, light shielding of 'just-taken' photos, preservation of developed photos, etc.
* How To Take Great Photos  Helpful steps are found on the inside of the cardboard container the film pack is housed in, of all places. I found the points outlined in this carton to be so vital for successful prints. Read and Heed.
* Use The Viewfinder Correctly  Since the focal length of the fixed focus lens is 106mm, and your objects or subjects are mostly over three feet from the camera  they will turn out great. Keep in mind that 106mm focal length is almost telescopic, but just fine for photos over three feet away. Pics less than three feet must be compensated through the viewfinder by taking pics aiming lower and to the right of what you 'see' in the viewfinder, especially for close-up shots. The viewfinder does not look directly into the lens of this camera. But the viewfinder tube helps correct for any parallax error so your photos should be perfectly framed!
* Hold Steady  It is very important the you hold the camera as steady as possible. Since this Polaroid StepOne2 is NOT digital, but analog, there is no anti-shake software to steady your photo shoot. It comes with a neck strap and if you hold the camera to your cheek pushing out on the neck strap as you gaze through the viewfinder, you can take a pretty steady photo. I ruined several dozen photos from NOT holding the camera steady enough. There is a standard tripod connection at the bottom of this camera. But, I was able to take very non-blurry pics after learning how to keep the Polaroid camera from shaking by using the strap.
* Shielding Developing Pics  I ruined so many photos, especially outdoors, from NOT shielding them correctly from the light right after taking them. Polaroid Originals I-Type film is sensitive to light even after it has been ejected from the camera. During these sensitive first few seconds, the film shield installed on your camera will extend on top of the photo and protect it from light. This allows enough time for the blue opacification layer to spread over the whole image. Shielding the photo during development time will ensure that you get deeper saturation, sharper details and that your final image is not washed-out, like so many of mine were. Polaroid suggests to shield your just taken photo for at least six minutes. You can place the developing print into a bag, pocket, or any other dark place you can find. Be prepared. I eventually learned to put my developing pics in my black camera bag to shield them from light sensitivity while developing. Polaroid also states that it takes approximately fifteen minutes to fully develop I-Type photo film prints. A bit longer can't hurt.
* Light Adjustment - If you are shooting using your cameras built-in flash, make sure that the lighten/darken wheel or slider of your camera is adjusted to the middle position at first. I have never had to adjust this setting from the middle position, even outdoors. Keep in mind that the built-in flash on Polaroid cameras is usually only effective in a range of 1  2.5 meters (3.3  8.2 ft) indoors. You have the option to turn the flash OFF. However, unless you are really trying to save battery life, or, taking many photos exclusively outdoors, I could not find a reason to ever turn the flash OFF.
* Film Storage - Polaroid Original film packs should be stored in their unopened, sealed packaging in a cool and dry environment. Polaroid recommends storing your film flat inside a fridge at a constant temperature between 4  18C / 41  65F. 
* Regularly Check Film Rollers - Their are two rollers inside the film door of your camera. They are responsible for spreading the chemistry between the negative and positive part of the photo. If they are dirty, the chemistry will not be spread evenly. This is the most common source of undesirable film defects according to Polaroid. So, Polaroid suggests to inspect the rollers each time you load film into the camera. It is good practice to carry a cloth with you for cleaning the rollers each time you insert a new pack of film. I now keep one handy in my camera bag. It took me four rolls of film to finally figure out the rollers needed cleaning. YUK!


*** Conclusion: ***

The Polaroid VF OneStep2 Analog Camera is a lot of FUN to use if you take the time to thoroughly understand the mechanics and necessary steps to insure successful photos. I wasted good film by not taking the time to realize the relevant basics. I do now and really love using this camera. What is interesting is that family and friends want a photo they can keep too. So, I wind up taking the same shots twice a lot. But, that is what this camera is really about - Instant photo prints to touch, keep, and share. WooHoo! I highly recommend this camera, especially for 'beginners' and kids over the age of ten. It is easy to operate and gives younger folks opportunities for impromptu photos, that would otherwise be forgotten and eventually deleted on a Smart Phone. I am only giving this camera four stars because I think Polaroid could do a much better job emphasizing one of the most important steps, shielding the developing photo print immediately from light. I don't ever remember having to do such with my old SX 70 forty years ago. Polaroid could recommend better ways to do so other then sticking the developing print in your pocket, etc. They could feature and make available a camera bag similar to what I use for buyers of their Polaroid OneStep2 Analog Camera. Still, I think you will enjoy taking pics with this camera. It is FUN seeing the finished product in your hands, and, like they say, A picture is worth more then a thousand words."^4^Jun 12, 2018 7:34 PM
optimummind^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^28^8^"======= Summary =======

The Polaroid Originals OneStep 2 camera is a neat retro-cool camera that satisfies your desire for a physical printed photograph minutes after it has been taken. The pictures have a cool retro vibe and atmosphere to it that some people will find artsy and attractive. Although the Black & White pictures come out fantastic, the quality of the color pictures fall a bit short compared to modern digital and smartphone cameras. As long as one is okay with that and is willing to keep paying for the relatively expensive Polaroid film refills, the OneStep 2 will delight you with its atmospheric and artsy pictures.


*** Pros ***

-Cool retro design and vibe for those who appreciate this kind of stuff.
-Near instant gratification of having a physical photo in your hands after shooting sessions.
-Black and White pictures look great.
-Retro and atmospheric color photos.
-Easy to operate and use.
-Easy charging through micro USB.

*** Cons ***

-Big and bulky compared to modern devices.
-Viewfinder is very small.
-The film refills are expensive - $1.99 per picture (before tax).
-Colors are muted and lack vibrancy.


======= Design & Useability =======

I find the design of the OneStep 2 to be retro-cool and somewhat cute. Initially, I was kind of shocked at how big and bulky it was compared to modern-day shooters. But I quickly got used to the size and to all the buttons and levers. Using it was dead simple. Load up the film pack, turn it on, and press down on the big red shutter button.

The included neck strap is a nice touch and that's how I carried the camera around with me. 

The camera has a simple design and is therefore easy to use and maintain.


======= Picture Quality =======

When it comes to consistency in photo quality, I had much better luck with Black and White photos. When shooting in Color, I had mixed results. Sometimes my subject was too blurry, sometimes too washed out, sometimes too overexposed, etc. But when I did get the right shot, the color shots looked decent with enough detail and color vibrancy. 

Colors, in general, come out too muted and I wished for more vibrancy and dynamic range.

Still, I had lots of fun shooting with the OneStep 2 and got many decent shots out of the film pack.


======= My Verdict =======

The Polaroid OneStep 2 is a fun camera to have around. After a few minutes of development time, you have a photograph right there in your hands. It is very simple to operate and use although photo quality consistency could be better (through better exposure control). As long as you're using the OneStep 2 as an additional supplemental and 'fun' camera and not a replacement for your smartphone or point-and-shoot camera, you won't be disappointed.

I give it 4 Stars due to the high cost of the film packs and muted colors."^4^May 30, 2018 1:41 AM
VADarkstar^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^12^4^"Polaroids new Viewfinder i-Type camera system is a disappointment in almost every dimension of its functionality. 

Its form will feel familiar to anyone who has used any earlier iteration from this line of cameras - the only major difference is that this camera uses an internal rechargeable battery (so there isnt a wasteful battery included with every packet of film). Loading and unloading film is very simple and the viewfinder really makes this a true point-and-shoot camera. 

But nearly everything about the images is disastrous - and in ways that dont even make sense for a company that should have had all these problems solved years ago. The i-Type film now comes in color packs and black-and-white packs - but the color photographs never pop like the old Polaroid shots did - and in every black-and-white picture I took, the blacks werent strong and the whites werent really white so all my pictures looked washed-out and not fully developed. Every picture I took looks awful.

And somewhere between the camera and the film, there must be a breakdown in how this system is supposed to handle daylight - the only pictures I took that looked exposed properly were ones taken inside using the flash with a subject that was at least five feet away - the pictures I took outside were so overexposed that you could barely tell what I had photographed.

I dont think Polaroid should be marketing such an instrument of nostalgia when their technology and chemical processes worked so much better over 35 years ago."^1^May 30, 2018 12:31 PM
FlyingC^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^8^0^"This camera is bulky, looks old, has a viewfinder and a neck strap, uses film, doesn't save your pictures to the cloud...and I LOVE it! The Polaroid is a work of art, a legend, and it just makes me smile to hold this camera in my hands and take photos with it.

I like that you have to actually think about framing the photo, which usually means moving yourself into the right position to take it. At about a dollar a photo, you slow down and think before you hit the shutter button. Then you carefully shield the photo from sunlight while you wait a few minutes for it to develop. The whole process is magical. 

One modern touch is a rechargeable battery which is really nice. It runs the rollers for spitting the film out, powers the flash, and lights up the quaint 'remaining photos' LED lights. The film packs load very easily, and you know when they're in properly because it spits out the cardboard cover piece.

Sure, the photos aren't crisp HD quality prints. But they are clear and have a wonderful nostalgic look to them. (I've attached a photo of a couple examples.) Best of all, in 80 or 100 years when people are trying to puzzle out how to read that old JPG computer file format, some lucky people will find these old Polaroid photos in a drawer and be able to instantly see what things looked like in 2018."^5^May 29, 2018 2:30 PM
RalphHenry^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"This instant camera is not for all types of events nor is it for detail work where you need a crisp image; however if you want the fun of creating your photo and passing it around at a party or a wedding, then it is a really useful camera. I think some bad reviews are caused because the user had an expectation of picture quality similar to an expensive digital SLR camera. If that is what you need, then this camera is not for you. If you just want a simple easy to use and enjoyable camera to play around with, then you will like this camera. One other note before I get into some of the details of my review: Many people found it troublesome that the viewfinder did not show you the actual view from through the lens. Polaroid has made an update that is an extension to the viewfinder that solved this problem. Be sure you purchase one with the extended viewfinder.
This camera will accept i-Type or 600 film. 600 film has a battery in it which you dont need since this camera has an internal re-chargeable lithium battery. The battery is good on one charge for 15-20 8-shot packs of film. Just get the i-Type film which is cheaper. I did see that Polaroid Originals warns against using the film in temperatures colder than 55 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Youll need to shoot from 2 to infinity so close ups are not something you can do. It has a built-in flash and you need to use the flash at all times indoors. Outdoors, to turn off the flash, you can simply hold a button on the back of the camera which is in-line with the shutter button on the front so it is easy to do. It has a self-timer which is necessary to get the shooter in a party shot and it was fun to use.
The color photos are sort of tinged a tan-yellow color for all images whether exposed indoors or outdoors. You do need to understand that once you take a photo you need to let it develop about 10 minutes before you can expose it to light. So instant just means you dont need a printer or a photography studio to see the photo you took, but you dont see it right away. Again as long as you understand this, it is still a hoot to use these cameras at parties  you just make a game of placing the photo face down for a few minutes at least. One easy way I found to protect the image is to turn the camera upside down while you remove the photo from the black roll-up tongue that covers it, then place it face-down. The black roll-up tongue goes back in the camera by itself once you slip it off the end of the photo.
The included neck strap is a little difficult to assemble, but it does hold securely once you attach it to the camera. There is a  20 tripod mount on the bottom which is very useful when doing a timer shot. A very nice manual is included and you do need to read it, it tells you how to know battery status and many details that are simple enough, but you need to learn them. By the way, there is a way to do multiple exposures with this camera, just Google it on the web, and youll see how.
Now here is why I would buy this camera personally: the black/white film is super nice. The picture is much clearer with more detail than the color film; and the retro look of b/w is very cool I think. I love this camera anyway and this b/w film makes it really wonderful."^5^Jun 1, 2018 4:38 PM

The camera can use either I-type film or more expensive 600 film. Since the OneStep doesn't need 600 film, I'd recommend you stick with I-type unless you're also using another camera that requires 600 film.

The OneStep produces pictures that are larger than most other modern instant film cameras. Each image is about 3 inches square, which is pretty nice. Unfortunately, that also means the film is a bit more expensive than the film used by some other instant film cameras that produce smaller images. It's a trade-off: larger image at greater cost per image or smaller image at lesser cost per image. I tend to like the larger images.

Plus, the OneStep looks a lot like the original Polaroid cameras I recall from when I was a kid. As many items are in a retro design phase now, from cars to cameras, I think the OneStep will blend right in.

In terms of image quality, the black & white film is terrific. The images show excellent contrast and strong levels of detail. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised.Color images are not quite as rich, but they are good enough for the medium.

Using the OneStep is super easy. Basically, it's a point-and-shoot analog camera. You load the film by opening the hinged door on the front. Turn it on, eject the film cover slip, and then start taking pictures.

The viewfinder is large and makes it pretty easy to properly frame the shot. Just like the Polaroids of yesteryear, the OneStep does not offer much in terms of controls. You do have a shutter button and an EV compensation switch, but that's about it.

The USB charger is in a handy location on the back, and the camera reportedly holds a charge for almost two months at a time.

Overall, this is a fun camera. It's a little bigger than some of the competition, but is still portable and easy to use."^4^May 29, 2018 12:46 PM

abl001^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^3^"The Polaroid Originals OneStep 2 was a mixed experience for me. While I appreciate the retro experience with instant tangible pictures that you can pass around, I also love the amazing quality that modern cameras produce at a fraction of the cost. 

First, the design and build just feels awkward to me. I get that it is essentially a replica of the original cameras from back in the day, but I just feels clunky to me. Personally, I'd rather have a modern sleek design that spits out a great Polaroid. Second, the viewfinder isn't a true viewfinder. That is to say what you see through the viewfinder isn't a true representation of what the lens is seeing. To me, that could've been so easily done, but wasn't. 

Picture quality is something that you have to adjust your expectations. You're not going to get a DSLR quality or even a cell phone quality picture with this camera. Hence, I think it is more of a novelty item. Would it work well for parties as an instant hand out? Sure. To me, it's like a portable photo booth. Quality isn't great, but it's fast enough to give instant gratification and either impress or distress some of those who aren't used to pictures without filters and editing. 

As someone who is very cost aware, the $1-2 a photo is enough to be all but cost prohibitive. Even as a teenager (before the days of cell phone and digital cameras) I loved taking pictures. Film and development costs were cheap enough you didn't sweat a few extra pictures to make sure you got a good one. With this camera, you better make sure you're happy with the first one because it won't be cheap if you need multiple tries. 

In conclusion, I just can't get behind this product for anything other than a novelty item. Maybe for a young kid or a special occasion as something to give guests an immediate takeaway. Either way, it will be quite costly given how we can easily take 10s-100s of pictures on any given event! The design, picture quality (expected given the format), and cost just make this a product I believe will have a very limited market.

*Novelty 
*Immediate tangibility 

Cons:

*Cost of film ($1-2 a picture)

btb2k^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Just like the original Polaroid, there is a learning curve for using this camera and there is a use case for them. Knowing the best conditions to take pictures in is key to enjoying this camera -- read the instructions inside the film box carefully for best results! 

The good: It's simple, very simple, to setup and use! Pull it out of the box, charge it up, load your paper and make sure that your subject has good lighting!!!

The bad: Lacking experience with this type of camera, you'll make mistakes and waste very precious photo paper! The subject MUST be still, and well lit otherwise it will not turn out like you think. I lost a few trying to take pictures with my family and lost a few precious moments due to movement which made me wish I'd taken the photo with my smartphone instead.

Being re-invented, I wish that the Polaroid Originals company would have considered adding a little bit more tech to help with the learning curve with this camera and help optimize for the best condition (like a shutter delay that is triggered when it senses no motion after the button is pressed and the proper lighting is present). The view in the viewfinder is slightly different from what will actually turn out which I didn't mind but it was noticeable. The quality/consistency of shots will definitely vary as conditions for lighting change constantly and again movement in any lower light situation will result in a blurry photo. Always keep the flash on would be some advice from my experience. 

Having stated that, the intent is that this camera is supposed to mimic the old Polaroids so it's to be expected that it would work similarly. So, if you're looking for that and don't mind wasting photo paper to sharpen your skills with it you'll be set. Once you do though, like me, I was able to turn out some good 'old school' pictures which was fun! The color photos are okay but I liked the B&W photos the best, hands down! 

I'd recommend this camera overall as it is fun and does bring back nostalgic memories of Polaroids, but where there are issues with the viewfinder matching, and inconsistency with photos and there is no modern tech used to help maximize your success of taking a great photo I'd give this camera an average rating. For those looking for a Polaroid like experience that's closer to the original, this would be great so I'd give it four stars."^4^Jun 3, 2018 6:08 PM
WhiskeyTango^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^3^"Polaroid OneStep 2

The new Polaroid OneStep2 is a significant evolution of the classic '600' OneStep series of insta-cameras. While still a fixed focus 'box' camera, now, there's a rechargeable battery, inside the camera, supposedly good for 80+ shots per full charge. 

OneStep 2 specs: optically coated, polycarbonate and acrylic lenses; built-in, USB-rechargeable Lithium battery (1100mAh, 60-days on full charge); power on/off slide switch; manual +over/-under exposure override slide switch; built-in, always on, auto-flash; manual, per shot, auto-flash suppression button; tripod mount; film magazine form factor same as classic 600; new I-Type film magazines (no internal battery); fixed focus lens 2ft/0.6m-infinity, 106 mm focal length; 41 degrees vertical x 40 degrees horizontal field of view.

[ Just for comparison, since I still own one, SX-70 OneStep Sonar): all glass optics, variable radar (or manual) focus, disposable flashbar, no self-timer (but remote trigger-able), many manual exposure settings, close-ups/macro shots, SX-70 film+battery magazines. ]

I-Type film: no battery inside the magazine, still only 8-shots per magazine (why not 10, if no battery?). Allegedly, I-Type film is *chemically identical* (but not colorimetry identical) to classic Polaroid 600. OneStep 2 can also use 600 magazines (even with dead magazine batteries). Both film types are best stored under refrigeration.

8-LED-dot remaining shots indicator, rather than a numreric countdown window. Once a magazine is loaded, don't open the loading door again until the magazine is completely expended (or unless you know how to manually re-insert a black/blank card on top of unexposed shots remaining in magazine). 

Always keep fingers clear of the ejection port when shooting. Easy to forget this until you develop this grip as automatic habit.

Viewfinder is high and left of the lens, so viewfinder aiming needs to be lower and to the right of what you 'see' through it, *especially* for closer shots. 

You can quickly teach yourself exactly how to off-center viewfinder framing by attaching a pivoting unipod to the OneStep 2's camera mount, extend the unipod by 2ft and point the leg of the unipod straight ahead toward your subject. The tip of the unipod, within the viewfinder will be the very nearly true center of the film frame. Once you've scoped center, fold the unipod down, out of frame, and snap away. 

Generally trust the OneStep 2's automatic exposure metering, before playing around with manual over/under-exposure override. Indoor light metering is strongly biased for auto-flash ON, not only for exposure, but color temperature 'accuracy.' For non-extreme lighting/contrast shots, neutral auto-exposure, with auto-flash on, almost aways gets the shot right. (Much more so than with my classic 600 fold-up Polaroid.)

Given the plastic lens, it would be a nice touch to have a removable lens cover for protection during transport. 

Multiple-exposure trick: first exposure, press & *hold* shutter button (film is not ejected), immediately power OFF OneStep2, release shutter button (film held in magazine), power ON OneStep 2, film is now ready for 2nd exposure. Repeat the press & HOLD shutter button as many times as you think you can get away with (might want to manually set OneStep 2 to UNDEREXPOSE each frame in some multi-exposure shots). Press and normally release shutter button on final exposure. You might need to blackout tape the autoflash, if you want no flash multi-exposures, because successful snap & hold is trickier than it initially seems. 

Multi-exposure shots will, of course, throw off your remaining shot count, because the One Step 2 counts shutter actions, not film ejections.

Not every double exposure will be a keepsake, but those that are can be magical. 

OneStep 2 color film white balance is off, recording 5k Kelvin daylight white as a greenish toned 3.8k Kelvin, skewing blues toward green. This doesn't happen with Fuji Instax film and it's even slightly greener than original 20th century Poloroid film. 

That color shift is OK by me, because there has always been an 'impressionistic'/artistic component to opportunistic/candid Polaroid photography. It's Polaroid's instant photography answer to sepia-toned-by-natural-aging B&W photo prints. A lot of people, myself included, like it for what it is.

Optically, the OneStep 2 doesn't capture anything close to the same level of fine details as Fuji Instax. For absolute color and detail accuracy, the OneStep 2 falls well behind Fuji Instax. (I also like the color accuracy of Fuji Instax, but for completely different reasons.)

There is a whole realm of artistic, instant photography that was created using Polaroid cameras/film. Call it both point-and-shoot spontaneous and impressionistic (warmer color pallet, softer focus) in memory. 

Another big thing is giving your snapshot away to your subject. Recalling a kinder and gentler time.

I like this re-invented OneStep 2, even though it will never replace my prized SX-70. The OneStep 2 is destined to go on more riskier jaunts.

If you are a fan of Polaroid's impressionistic capture, instant photography, then I recommend this one for you to try. No easier way to join the ranks. It's fun.

My only lament is that Polaroid needs to fully replicate the photographic colorimetry of the no longer made 20th century Poloroid film, with the OneStep 2, using the current film chemistry. This might wind up requiring a change to the optical coating on the polycarbonate lens, rather than trying to fully replicate an elusive original film recipe (the one that developed faster and required no frog's-tongue/window-shade light-cover-on-eject kludge). Polaroid should seriously work on this and, perhaps, come up with a user swappable lens."^4^Jun 2, 2018 2:44 AM

This camera looks and feels like the old polaroids, but it has been updated and modernized with an internal rechargeable battery, flash, and LED indicators for battery and film remaining. The film is a little pricey compared to the other options on the market, pricing out to about $1.95 a photo if I did the math right. Also make sure you carefully read the instructions on the film, as mishandling during the 'processing' could lead to imperfections or mis-exposures. I felt a little bit like the colors weren't as bright as they could be, but I haven't gone through more than one package of the film yet. For nostalgia lovers, this is your gig. One has to remember the old Polaroid quality of the 80s and expect that instead of perfection. If you're looking for a modern instant camera I would invite you to compare this to some of the available instax models. Fun to shoot and play around with!

BBReviewer^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Bringing back the popular instant camera from the 70's seems like an interesting idea, and it can be fun. But gone are the days of needing to wait 10-15 minutes to get that printed square photo. With smart phones we can get immediate photos that we can send to anyone or save forever. We can get them printed at lots of places (even Shutterfly) for about 5/photo. The film for this camera costs about $16 for 8 photos ($2 each). 
This camera is simple to use... Point, shoot, wait 10-15 minutes for your photo to develop. Oops! Too dark... Adjust the brightness... Oh no! Too light. That's $4 already in the trash. This camera is also big and clunky. There is a neck strap, but who wants that big camera hanging on their neck? 
I just don't get the need for this camera in this day and age. It is too difficult to get that good shot especially for the price of each photo and it is basically featureless. What seemed like a good idea just isn't worth it."^3^Jun 13, 2018 4:01 PM
RacineTechie^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The design and feel of the camera is just about exactly like the old models I used in the 70s/80s -I'm old(er) and this camera made me feel like a kid again.

We used it at a yard party and parade and looking at the photos was hilarious. Seeing them in this format again for the first time in years, they instantly looked like 'old photos' from an album.
I think it is also interesting for younger people and kids to see what it was like in the old days - our nieces both have the pic-300s now and get a kick out of them. Buying film with their allowance is also teaching them about the value of money and how they spend it. The film isn't cheap, so they have to pick their shots carefully."^5^Jun 12, 2018 9:17 PM
DarthNeyehilus^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This camera is cool.

Really, it is. Everything about it works well, and it looks great. Basically, if you're looking for a functioning, retro-infused camera, this is it. The only real cons are that the initial price tag is steep, in my opinion, and the photos on the film used could be better. 

The good: upon unboxing, it's clear this is a no-frills camera. It houses a rechargeable battery, and that's about the only external function. Buttons to adjust lighting are there, and taking a picture is easy. Viewfinder is very clear. Pictures print fast, and don't take long to develop. It's a smaller camera, but still too big to fit into a purse. Battery lasts quite a while (have it yet to die after two weeks and 16 photos through it.) 

Bonus: you can use older 600 style film with this camera. 

The bad: doesn't come with any trial film, the photos printed take a bit of trys to have a nice look to them, only 8 photos per cannister, and the price. 

If you can get past those issues, and want a functioning, smaller version of a Polaroid camera, look no further than this one."^4^Jun 8, 2018 12:41 PM

stevefromtheburbs^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Having been someone who took way more Polaroid pictures in my lifetime, I can tell you that this is a great balance of performance with todays technology, with the cool factor of being able to take and hold a picture in your hand, watching it come to life as it develops before your eyes. 

I'm old enough to remember the 1970's Polaroid pictures and what they meant to us back then, and through the years. I've watched my kids look at this technology and some feel the exact same way. They can take a favorite picture, and place it into a picture frame, put on the dashboard of their car, hang not their bathroom mirror, all the stuff we did with them, and see how while you can take a million pictures today and only print the ones you want, somehow taking that picture and holding it in your hand is as cool to them as it was to us (and still is to us). 

It seems the quality of the pictures coming out are of a better quality than I remember of the old ones, and they look great. 

The camera has a battery that is rechargeable and will last upwards of 60 days (I haven't had it that long to confirm that). But you'll likely charge it before use anyway. Polaroid cameras were something you took with you to go take pictures, so you'd know and have it ready to go. 

The film isn't cheap to buy, but you need to remember that you are buying a photo lab with each picture. Printing pictures today cost money too, just not quite as much. But you have to go somewhere to get it processed, and so far, I haven't found anything that replicates the look of Polaroid with anything other than a Polaroid. 

Treat yourself. Treat a young person to something that they haven't had a chance to grow up with like we did. Let them see and hold a picture in their and watch their faces as they see it develop. One of my new favorite picture is an impromptu Polaroid picture of our family. Does it look like it was taken with a 16MP fancy camera? No, but it is not supposed to look that way - I like simplicity and the reliability of this camera. 

Thanks Polaroid for brining this back - not only for my benefit, but so my kids can live out the fun taking Polaroid pictures for themselves.

Several companies have been making similar products as of late, but this camera has the size and feel of the old Polaroids that I remember. 

This camera is fairly simple to operate (except an awkwardly placed shutter button), has a USB cable for charging, and easy loading film. There is an adjustment for brightness of your pictures, but the adjustments are pretty limited. I used an entire roll of color film this Memorial weekend, and the first few looked pretty foggy after developed, possibly due to me needing to adjust the brightness. I made some on the fly adjustments and kept snapping away. The later shots, in shady environments, came out pretty well...as much as can be expected from a Polaroid anyway. But the end results look very 1990s. But that is almost the point, isn't it?

This is not a digital camera. No, it will not compete with modern cell phones. I would really like to see this camera, even if at a higher price point, incorporate a digital memory slot to also store the pictures digitally. That way you have the feel good throw back picture, but also the higher quality digital copy that you can send or print out as many times as you wish. I understand they want to sell film, but consumers would use both. I am sure of it.

This is a great camera to relive times past and have pictures to put up on your pin board in your scrap room or office. The film is a little pricey, but this camera is what you would expect in a classic Polaroid. If they add a couple modern touches, this would be gold."^4^May 30, 2018 2:12 PM
callmeageeth^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Analog film is making a comeback. Me personally, I rarely print any photos anymore. If I take a great photo, I generally only show it to someone on my phone. It's just too much of hassle (and I forget) to get prints made. But I loved old Polaroids and love the idea of taking a picture and instantly having it printed to put on my fridge, or clipped onto a cool piece of artwork.

If you're familiar with Polaroids, you'll know that Polaroid photos have a distinct vintage feel, with muted colors. Personally, I love it. This new Polaroid One replicates what you remember from Polaroids of years past to a T. It takes great vintage photos that you can immediately view and share. I love the rechargeable battery and the automatic timer (more on that in a moment). The film is easy to load and unload. 

HOWEVER, in an age when we take photos with our phone on a whim, literally snapping a photo of anything and everything, a Polaroid forces you to think about your shot. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. You only get 8 shots per roll of film and at $19.99 for 8 shots, they're quite pricey. But going through the effort of making a good picture allows you to do just that, get a great and memorable photo. With your phone you might take 3 or 4 pictures really quick in hopes you'll get the right one. But now you have to make sure everything is lined up beforehand. 

As for the timer, it's nice, but it's tough to get right. For example, if you want to be in the picture with your friends (and there's no stranger around) you have to find something at the appropriate height to put your camera on, line it up just right, and seemingly hope for the best. This is standard protocol for any self-timer, but the stakes are higher for the previously listed reasons: price of the photos. 

At the end of the day, if you're one that wants some cool vintage looking shots, this is the best instant camera. But know that you will be limited in the number of shots you can take given the price. 8 photos in today's digital world is not a lot."^4^May 29, 2018 12:20 PM
MarkyMark14^/polaroid-originals-onestep-2-vf-analog-instant-film-camera-summer-blue/6333139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"I bought this camera but returned it before I ever used it. My wife wanted the larger square Polaroid film and there are only a few cameras that use it. After looking at reviews I saw a comparison of this Polaroid camera with the Fujifilm Instax SQ6 which also has square film but in a smaller size. The quality of the Polaroid pictures was just like the old cameras. They were not very clear and the colors were not very accurate. The Fujifilm camera took much better pictures when it comes to clarity and colors. So if you want that nostalgic look, get the Polaroid. If you want the square film with the white borders but better quality (even though it's smaller in size), then get the Fujifilm Instax SQ6."^3^Jan 16, 2019 5:33 PM

BeezNutz^/canon-powershot-sx740-hs-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6287924?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^43^18^"We upgraded from our Canon PowerShot SX720 HS 20.3 MP Compact Digital Camera - 1080p a camera our whole family truly loved. Great photos, excellent video, and very easy to operate. We still have this camera and love it. One of the reasons I upgraded was I could use the same batteries I already had with the new camera.

The good is this camera looks and feels great. Comes with an upgraded processor, 4k video and timelapse and a ton of bells and whistles. That is about where the good stops and the bad starts.

With the upgraded processor it seems to have some lag from when the shutter is pressed and when the image is taken. Big problem, I am trying to capture action and you really have to adjust your timing, but that is just the start.

The 4k video in a bright room was grainy and almost unwatchable - i didn't even share any of the dozen or so videos I took because they are so far from the quality I am used to. The focus on the video is another huge problem. It had trouble and would keep adjusting the focus during recording also adding to make these unwatchable.

The photos also leave a lot to be desired. I tried every mode and auto and the same result. Grainy, unfocused, even in good light. Low light forget it. The 4k timelapse was okay, it takes 24 minutes to make a 24 second clip and that was okay. The photos/video just did not cut it for the pricetag. I took this back. I may buy another of the camera I bought this one to replace.

I returned this unit for the video/photo quality - out of focus, grainy, even in good light. Check other reviews and judge for yourself - better yet go try one in person before buying to help avoid yourself the trouble of a return."^1^Oct 3, 2018 1:56 PM

That being said, I bring it for photos of my daughter and her friends at the Friday night football games.  She wants me to video the entire show and not her zoomed in so I wanted something with a wide zoom and 4k for the video.  The video in this camera looks amazing.  Under the dim high school lights you can see the difference between this camera and my 7D but it still looks good.  The zoom on this camera is CRAZY!  I do not use the digital zoom.   This was my first game to use the camera tonight and what I did not like was where the record button is and how it feels.  My other cameras have the button on the back where I can see it and it is easy to press.  The record button is small and level with the camera.  I had a hard time finding it without shaking the camera.  I am attaching two images to show what the optical zoom can really do.  I had to reduce the quality slightly so I could attach the images.   The game clock in the 2nd image is at max optical zoom.  That same game clock is in the middle of the zoomed out picture.

I have the original first generation of this camera SX700HS. This new camere is the 4th generation, a little larger. It takes great pictures but they changed the buttons which I don't like.

This never happened in the first generation. The screen glass is about 20% larger (right and left side) than the display. They have the real estate to make the screen larger but they keep it at 3'.

Everything is still working as it did the day I bought it. Tons of neat features and functions!! takes nice video and great pictures!! 

It does have a neat function where you can bluetooth sync your phone and camera to use your phone as a remote. Just be warned it does seem to change the formatting on the card to do this. Once this is set up the card will no longer be able to read by pc. You will either have to use a cable to transfer from the camera to the pc or use the sync function to move the pictures to your phone then to a pc if desired. There is stuff that says you can sync it with your pc wirelessly though I have not found a working version of this I trusted.

Back in the day, I used a film SLR, digital SLR, and eventually a Canon SX10IS.  For personal reasons, I didn't want to bring something even that big along.  I'm SO happy I didn't!  The zoom on this baby is incredible! Quick video! So light, and intuitive to figure out without needing to refer to the quick start guide.  And my pictures and videos were AWESOME!  My dad, who fancies himself a semi-pro, and carried all of his big gear and lenses around, was a wee bit envious of how quickly I could get a shot just as good, if not BETTER than his! I think my zoom was better than anything he had with him!  ;)

*I loved*: size, weight, instructions on screen for various features, movable screen (to see better in glare situations, or for selfies!)

*Meh*: wrist strap is so long that it's practically non-functional (I had to swap with another device I had for fear of dropping camera), screen location seems like it might get scratched and camera is hard to hold without getting your fingers all over it (my SX10IS has a screen that opens up + a viewfinder), wi-fi capabilities are quite cumbersome/slow and I haven't found a way to send just one photo instead of dumping them all (Admittedly, I have not yet paired my smartphone with the camera, so maybe that's different.)

I think the Canon - PowerShot SX740 HS is by far the best camera for the money. Great still photos, wonderful video, and transfer capability out the wazoo. Great compact size for travel and zoom is terrific for a small point and shoot camera. I would recommend purchasing a second battery for those sightseeing days when everything is to your liking. The 'flip-up' view screen is very bright and clear, but I would like to see more agility from the view screen. It is a great vlogging camera, but for those of us who won't be using it as a video diary camera, a nice tilt/swivel screen (especially in bright light conditions) would be great.

I got a sony that should have been ideal but the camera would not save off the raw data and even great pictures looked 'muddled' when I zoomed in. I tried for a few years to love it, hoped for sweet firmware update of my dreams, but nope.

I went to Best Buy and picked the cameras up, tried them out, and ultimately settled on this one. I barely had the money for it - budgets being what they are, you know.... but at home, right out of the box, there was the familiar cannon button layout... and I fiddled a bit with the settings... and now - i'm taking pictures again!! To attach to documents, of my family, of my pets and other people's pets... i'm getting excited to start another 40-pic theme collage (20x40, print at walgreens, slip in a frame, and voila, decorate the walls with memories).

5 stars, really? Well, yeah. I decided there was no 'point' (har har) in taking off a star because it isn't quite trim enough to slip flat into my pocket. There's a wrist strap that I can shorten and use a carabiner to hang from a belt loop on those hands-free days. I can fit it in my pocket book. But most of all, MOST of all... 5 stars alone for pics not looking 'muddled' when I zoom in. 

I havent printed any blowups yet, but I will and I'll update the review after that if I can... 

I recommend going in to a store (when you are off quarrantine) and holding this in your hands and trying the controls out. I am so glad I did. There are 2 cameras I can upcycle now that i have this one to take their place!"^5^Mar 20, 2020 6:03 PM

Out of the box its an excellent YouTube videos, with supplied lenses. Comes with a very nice telephoto len as well in this bundle. This camera is so versatile that with all of its abilities kinda seems like a new camera every time you get a new app! The camera apps work great! The apps alone are awesome! Things you just cant do with a regular camera. Because its mirror less it can shoot up to 11 FPS! The apps also help beginners get the exact settings correct for a certain type photo. Now the software. The PlayMemories app lets say, is terrible. I got a Nikon a month ago. This camera takes better pics and video. But the PlayMemories app is the worst. Thank goodness once you get to know the camera you can get around some of it. I have a Cadillac camera with Edsel software. Its really bad. I wont say it doesnt work, but what should be minutes turns into hours. Its almost like after they got done designing the camera, the app was just slapped together. This software, (PlayMemeries) should be recalled. I sure hope Sony is working on the problems. Right after I got it there was an upgrade, made it a tad easier but way short of plug and play. More like plus and pray it works this time. With it Ipad, Android phone and PC, the software flaws are even more appearent. I cant say enough good about the camera. Weather your a pro or amature,m your will love this camera! You may cry however every time you have to use PlayMemories. You will have memories alright after using this garbage, truly sad garbage software. Really disappointed in it t say the least. It takes it from fun, to a nightmare of searching the internet for the same problems everyone else is having. I literaly found out to make it work from a photography studio. Sony has got to be aware of this! With the other manufacturers are catching up with mirrorless, Sony really needs to get on the ball with this mess or it will cause a huge Loss in sales from word getting out. Just read everything and expect some hiccups when trying to set up WiFi. Truly a nightmare. The camera is so good at its price though I would still recommend. You will know more about photography by the time your hooked up. Im speaking of the Playmemories app that has all the problems. The camera apps are great however. Playmemories is the software that communicates with the cam and computer. Really bad!!!!"^4^Feb 13, 2019 12:38 PM
TheDuke^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^44^4^"Though the actual Polaroid brand has been defunct for many years; the name has been sold (and resold) - eventually becoming Polaroid Originals (as of 2017). And, with the new name comes a new version of the classic OneStep camera from 1977.

The OneStep+ is a nearly identical refresh to the OneStep SX-70 model, but the nostalgia may not be widely appreciated at such a high price. The + is incredibly fun to use (especially for those who grew up using the originals), but the enjoyment is quickly snubbed out when you realize just how expensive it is.

The camera is more expensive than anyone would guess, and the Film (which is not included) costs around $16. If that doesn't sound like a lot, keep in mind that you only get 8 photos - which means that you are literally paying $2.00 for each picture! And dont forget that with Polaroid, each photo is a gamble. Waiting up to 15 minutes to see your image might be exciting at first, but soon comes the realization that most results are mediocre (at best) and there is a reason that the simplicity (and high quality) of Digital has taken over the photo landscape. 

Not having to develop film is no longer novel as it once was. In the past, this feature may have saved time and offset the high cost of the camera & special film. But, now that we all have the ability to take high definition digital photos, nobody is driving to an awkwardly placed photo-hut to pay for film developing. We actually can see our pictures instantly. We can retake them and even edit them to our liking.

This camera is not all bad  in fact, it is simple and enjoyable to use (if you dont mind spending money up front, and continuing to spend money every time you take a picture). Synching the OneStep+ to your phone is a welcome innovation and is incredibly quick and easy. This helps users learn to use the camera and adds features that otherwise could not have been included (without adding buttons or a screen that would have further increased the cost). Using the phone as a shutter remote is convenient. It is also quite satisfying to see your picture automatically pop out of the camera after the phone hears your subjects say CHEEEEEESE! The best feature, by far, is the double exposure which allows you to layer two pictures on-top of one another for a truly artistic result.

The only disappointment is that the phone is not able to display what the camera sees. This leads to many awkward moments of looking through your viewfinder while also awkwardly fumbling with your phone. I wish that Polaroid would have found a way to further utilize the capabilities of our smartphones. Oddly, most photo-shoots conclude with the user taking a cell phone picture of their Polaroid picture. Now else are we to share our blurry hipster vignettes? 

It is always hard to convince people to pay something that they can get for free  and this is the challenge that Polaroid now faces. I truly do want this camera to be a success. But Sadly, I believe that the skill of taking a great Polaroid picture will continue to be a lost art.

The original Polaroid company went bankrupt in 2001. The 'new' Polaroid company went bankrupt in 2008. Let's hope Polaroid Originals can finally find a way carry nostalgia into the future. 


PROS:
+ Comes with a rechargeable battery built in
+ Pairing with a phone is extremely easy
+ View finder is covered with rubber making it more comfortable to hold up to your eye
+ Has a solid build quality
+ Has physical buttons & switches for a more retro feel
+ Lens adjusts for portraits (close up) or standard (distance) photos
+ Has multiple picture options: The most fun being double exposure
+ Allows for Manual adjustment of aperture, flash intensity, shutter speed, etc - which allows a higher level of personalization.
+ Can be mounted on a standard tripod
+ Shutter can be triggered by noise (when the group says 'CHEESE!' the Camera snaps the picture)
+ Bright & useful flash
+ LED lights show how many pictures are remaining in the camera 
+ Comes with neck strap & charging cable

CONS:
- Cameras price is high
- The Camera does NOT come with any film
- Film is expensive
- Only holds 8 pictures
- Size is bulky and not particularly portable
- Lens is exposed and does not come with a lens cap
- Viewfinder is small and a bit awkward to use (as often you are trying to manipulate your phone while also looking through the camera)
- Cell Phone cannot be used as a viewfinder (it does not display the image of that the camera sees)
- The paired phone cannot be used to view the picture taken
- Picture quality is not any better than Polaroid cameras from decades ago
- Film takes a long time to develop (between 5 & 15 minutes) (which also seems as though it should have improved over the years)
- Comes with a USB charging cable, but not with the adapter to plug it into a wall"^4^Sep 19, 2018 12:58 PM
Daddio^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"Older People like me think of 1970s cameras as dinosaurs with no practical modern value, but perhaps its because Im living as a (very) mature adult and forgetting how young people socialize. When I asked my 22 yr old daughter to suggest a birthday gift I was surprised to hear that she really wanted one of these modernized Polaroid OneStep+ cameras after seeing one used at a party. Of course most everyone carries a technically far superior cameras to this one on their cell phone, but in a crowded table at a restaurant or party its not very practical to hand your cell phone around to everyone in the room, to get a laugh at a funny or poignant picture you just took. Thats a good way to lose a cell phone. Apparently a real film camera that produces a physical picture that they can actually handle and pass around is a unique and conversation starting experience for todays young people. Most of them have seen Polaroid cameras in movies, music videos and old TV shows, but theyve never seen one of them function in person. Its quite a novelty. 

What makes this modern duplicate of the original OneStep+ camera a modern camera, is its Bluetooth connectivity. Not only can the OneStep+ shutter be controlled (remote, manual mode, self timer, double exposure, noise trigger, light painting) from a free phone App, the App also saves every picture taken digitally and allows the user to email copies with captions to anyone they want to. Its the best of old and new, blended together into a real party pleaser.

FEATURES:
- The user can experiment with three different film pack types (2 color, 1 black and white).
- Light exposure is adjustable.
- The OneStep+ camera electronics and flash can be charged from any cell phone charger or USB port through the included USB to Micro-USB cable. 60 day battery life.
- 1 year warranty
- Produces both physical and digital copies of each photo.
- Self timer and shutter can be triggered on camera or from cell phone within Bluetooth range.
- Close-up (1 foot) or wider lens can be selected with manual lever

PROS:
- Lots of fun at an adult party or for children at a family event.
- Three different film packs available for different effects and light conditions.
 
CONS:
 - The different Film packs cannot be removed, swapped and reused without losing one picture each time, because of light exposure to the top film sheet.
- It doesnt fold flat like the higher end old Polaroid cameras, so it is bulky to pack or carry by its neck strap. 

CONCLUSION:
I never would have considered this reimagining of an old film camera if my daughter had not expressed interest. It is affordable and it will gather lots of attention wherever you use it. Enjoy."^5^Sep 19, 2018 7:47 PM
stoptheclocks^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"I was really excited to get this Polaroid OneStep instant film camera. I mean, it is retro and retro is in right now.
When I opened the box, a familiar product greeted me, the Polaroid OneStep. It looks like something I remember. Once I unboxed everything completely and held the camera, it actually felt a little cheap with all its parts being plastic. It is a great thing that this camera comes with a neck strap so it wont fall and break into pieces. It is put together like the orginals Polaroid, which draws on nostalgia. But dont let the plastic outside fool you, this Polaroid has some real nice features and of course instant film.
The built in flash makes sure you have adequate light when taking pictures. The pictures I took turned out better with the flash on, than off. This is also a light sensor that you can adjust. It helps with pictures taking when it is bright or a little darker. That is very convenient especially in evening time pictures. The viewfinder, it shows what you will take a picture of, obviously. There are two lenses portrait and standard. Simple, portrait will take close up picture 3ft and in, and the second lens is for wider shots around 2 ft to whatever distance away you would like to take. It is nice to have a choice. I took a portrait picture of a friend and it turned out fine and met my expectations of what a Polaroid camera pictures take. Which is analog not digital and pictures are not perfect, but that is considered a charm of this camera, like the originals 1970s.
There are a set of 8 small lights on top of the camera that will tell you how much film you have left. A little disappointed here because one pack of i-Type film will only give you 8 pictures. I wish it would hold more, so you dont go through film so fast. 
Of course there is a power switch on the top back of the camera. Easy on/off switch that you can slide up or down. 
The film is easy to insert. You can choose only color or black/white when you purchase the film. It is a pack of 8 instant camera film. To open the film deposit, slide the switch on the front right above the opening that the film will go in. The bottom of this area falls and you can insert the correct side up. The film tells you on the pack which side to place up or down.
The difficult part of the camera should be the easiest: Bluetooth. I followed the instruction to a tee and I could not get the camera to link the bluetooth to my Smartphone. I tried for a long time to get this to work and found that, to hook up Bluetooth, I had to adjust how I did it. Now I dont know how if everyones experience was the same as mine, but here is how I hooked up Bluetooth.
Go to Bluetooth settings on your smartphone. Input Find other devices and an Icon for the camera should show up. I tried to pair with Bluetooth by pressing the + on the camera. I was not able to pair the two together. I tried a lot of different ways and finally found a way that worked. Others who have this camera and their smartphone may have an easier time. 
So I opened the Polaroid app first, then I turned on the Bluetooth on the camera by pressing +. The phone having detected the camera in Bluetooth mode, recognized the polariod device (but wouldnt pair). Then I went into the already open app and selected and selected the OneStep bar. Then it hooked up the camera to my smartphone. Once I knew this is how it worked, I had no problems pairing the two together.
On the smartphone it gives you several ways to take pictures, including: Remote, Self timer, Double exposure, Light painting, noise trigger and manual mode. This is way more advanced than the original and more fun too, with Bluetooth.
This Polaroid OneStep+ is for the individual who likes retro products with a modern take. The picture quality comes out very similar to the original. Dont expect digital quality because this is analog. The instant film is nice to get right away, but it has to set in for 10-15mins before the picture will truly be a finished product. The film is a bit on the expensive side at $16-$18 for 8 pictures! Make sure each picture counts and have fun. I am giving it three stars because of the Bluetooth problem I had and the expensive nature of the film. Also it is made of plastic, which make it kind of vulnerable to drops or mishandling. But I love the idea and the reality of this camera introduced to a new generation of people having never seen anything like this in their life. It is a fun device to play with, and will be a hit around different events where you can take pictures and make memories."^3^Sep 20, 2018 8:14 AM
RedScorpion^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^3^"Brief Summary: The OneStep+ is an expensive, finicky nostalgic throwback. It works with the Bluetooth on your smartphone to take timed shots and to scan in your photos (among other features), but at roughly $2+ a picture, you would be better off sticking to the Polaroid Snap Touch or purchasing a photo printer.

Nostalgic tech is everywhere these days. My girlfriend and I are building our own vinyl record collection. Modern tech is working to make some of these old analog trinkets work better with our digital devices. The OneStep+ aims to recapture the nostalgia of the old OneStep cameras, but it adds Bluetooth functionality to enable timed shots and double exposures. Problem is its just all a bit too cumbersome. Setting up the analog levers on the camera, lining up the shot, and then snapping with the phone is just a hassle. I do like the ability to scan in my Polaroid pictures with the app, but it was a bit difficult keeping the glare out of the scan.

Then there are the actual pictures. The cartridges come in packs of 8. My black and white pictures look good. But my color pictures on the i-type film were awful. 2/8 pictures came out. At $2.00 a picture ($16 - $20 for a cartridge of 8), I cant see myself wanting to practice or make this into an actual hobby. I read later that the color film is more sensitive to light and that those pictures need to be shielded for up to 6 minutes. The black and white pictures came out better, but, again, this is a hassle.

I like the idea of instant prints, but the OneStep+ is too cumbersome and difficult to be much more than a novelty. I cant see myself using it much until cartridges come down in price a good deal. I love the look and this did give me a nostalgic thrill, but it also reminded me why I love my digital camera and my smartphone."^3^Sep 19, 2018 3:35 AM
TechTux^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"I really enjoyed the Polaroid camera as it brought back a lot of nostalgic memories. The feel, look and functionality of the camera all felt natural. The only issue was the limitations of picture quality and cost of the film itself. However that smell of film when installing the film cartridge brought back so many wonderful memories.

Pros:
Rechargeable Battery
Lightweight
Actual Buttons / Switches
Light indicator of pictures left
Able to be mounted on a Tripod
Bright Flash
Portrait and Landscape Mode
Multiple App functionality via Phone

Cons:
Cost of Camera
Cost of Film
Average Picture Quality
No Lens Protection

::Setup::
It is ready right out of the box, easy to insert film cartridge turn on and shoot. Even the strap is nostalgic trying to get those darn straps through the small plastic bindings. It takes about 30 seconds for the flash to charge and be ready when turning on. The App setup was very easy as well and comes with video guidance. You just hold down the Bluetooth button on the camera and it easily connects to the phone. The app provides a lot of additional features which I will go into later.

::Ease Of Use::
The camera's case is plastic which makes it lightweight and easy to hold steady for that perfect shot. There is no way to know how the shot will look before taking so it falls back to old school of looking through the view finder and making an educated guess. The button responds perfect to the touch and the film pops out without issue. It takes about 15 minutes for the film to develop so must be patient and keep out of the sun. Battery life is days and not a worry as more then likely you will run out of film before running out of battery. 

::Picture Quality::
The picture quality is average and is geared more towards those looking for a nostalgic shoot. It is very important to keep out of directly sunlight and allow 15 minutes for the picture to fully develop. Also just like back in day do not shake/wave the picture trying to make it develop faster as it could ruin the picture. There are two types of film cartridges , Color and B&W, however both cost the same 16 dollars at the time writing this. $16 dollars for 8 shots = $2 per shot is very pricey so expect to pay a lot for your pictures.

::Phone App::
I was really impressed with the features Polaroid provided through the application. Understandable they are limited with the camera hardware itself yet was able to add a lot of useful features. You have the ability to take pictures remotely through the phone which works like a charm. The self timer is always useful along with the manual mode to have the customization of aperture / flash / timing. The fun features is the double exposure / light exposure and noise trigger. The double exposure provides a fun ghost like image or dual image. The light exposure provides a rave like look making it fun and very creative. The noise trigger is great when wanting to capture that moment of laughter or surprise !

::Scanner (Phone App::
The Scanner function was by far the most used feature for myself. After you take a picture using the camera you can then use the scanner option to save the picture to your phone. This is ideal for being able to keep a digital copy of your original shot. You hold the phone at an angle and the software automatically adjusts and capture just the picture itself. It scans it perfectly without any issues and save the picture in your picture gallery.

Overall I really enjoyed this camera and it brought back so many great memories. Unfortunately that comes at a cost as the camera is very pricey and the picture quality itself is average. In addition the cost of the film per shot is very expensive, I can see myself only using this on special occasion. I would recommend this camera for those who wan the old school feel and nostalgic shot."^4^Oct 8, 2018 10:39 AM
VADarkstar^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"Polaroids OneStep+ is a modern update of an old classic with a rechargeable battery an a snazzy app - but these adaptations arent sufficient to rescue the system from mediocre results. The camera is ostensibly a point-and-shoot camera - it has a switchable lens that allows you to shoot larger spaces (3 ft. to infinity) and close-ups (1-3 ft.) - it defaults to flash mode but there is a flash override - and the camera allows adjustment of exposure. Little lights on the top of the camera show you how many exposures you have left in your current film pack.

The application designed to accompany the camera appears to be in testing mode but I didnt encounter any problems with it - I think it is well designed. The camera communicates directly with the application by bluetooth and allows for remote triggering, double exposures, light painting, noise triggering, manual exposure mode, and a couple other features - the features I tried worked flawlessly. The connection between camera and app does NOT upload images to your device - though the app does have a scanning feature that photographs your images and adjusts them appropriately (assuming you arent capable of holding them perfectly square or perpendicular to your device) - but scanning your Polaroid picture means youre taking a picture of a picture which seems like a bit much to me.

But at the end of the day, Polaroid film is VERY light-hungry and the OneStep+ pictures are only successful when taken outside on a sunny day or taken inside as a portrait using the flash. And the exposures I have tried so far using the new i-Type film look very washed-out. I have found that flash close-ups inside are the most successful pictures but successful pictures arent necessarily compelling. The i-Type Black-and-White film had a nice rich range of grays but I dont think that they are enough to recommend this camera overall. The OneStep+ is designed for the new i-Type film but it also accepts the older Color 600 type film (I havent tried that older style film - I know that I loved it back in the 1980s when I owned several predecessors of this new Polaroid for the 21st century).

The camera and the film (at least the i-Type film) are a pair and even though the film is most likely the source of the unsatisfying results, you gotta have the film to sell the camera and I dont think this film does that adequately. Polaroid used to sell miracles back in the day - now they just seem to be selling meh."^2^Sep 26, 2018 12:15 PM
couponkingofjax^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"Overall: I would highly recommend this camera if you're wanting to get back into Film. They have done a great job keeping the camera simple while adding a ton of new features for 2018. And there's something to be said about having a photo instantly in your hand. 

I grew up with Polaroid cameras so its nice to see they're making a resurgence with a few nice updated touches. The camera itself works relatively the same as an old Polaroid. The difference now is that the camera can connect through your bluetooth on your phone. Setup was SUPER easy and only took seconds. Honestly it was probably one of the easier devices i've setup lately so bravo to them for that. The ability to use software add's a lot of new features to the polaroid camera:

Self Timer - the ability to set a timer before the camera takes a picture. 
Remote- The ability to use your phone to fire the camera remotely.
Double Exposure - The camera will take 2 photos before exposing it on the film. 
Light Painting - Ability to use light externally to add brushes of light to the photo. This is best done with a flashlight or bright spotlight that you can move around and create trails.
Noise Trigger - ability to fire the camera using a loud noise. 
Manual Mode - what you would expect from a manual mode, ability to adjust aperture, time and flash. 

All of these options open up a lot of possibilities for the camera itself and I think make the Polaroid a viable option again for people wanting to get back into Film. There's something to be said about having a tangible photo in your hand immediately as opposed to it just getting lost in your Phone. I felt that feeling immediately with the first picture of my dog Chloe, which I now have hanging on my fridge. The first one in a LONG time thats ever made it to the fridge, so there's something to be said for that. I definitely recommend this Camera."^5^Sep 25, 2018 10:59 AM
TheTruQ^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"I remember the days of the original Polaroid cameras. The ability to take photos and instantly see them was a convenience that was greatly appreciated. Now, we have digital cameras built into just about everything we use for media consumption. No more waiting for pics to develop, and you can send them to anyone in an instant. So why the Polaroid One Step Plus? Well, nostalgia, for starts. Also, I like the idea of going back to the insta-picture days, spitting out a hard copy on demand.

The One Step Plus comes in a nice tight box. Polaroid has packaging that rivals some of the better electronic devices I have purchased. The box is tight with a cardboard cushioned interior. Included with the camera is a USB cable for recharging and a lanyard for carrying. There is a quick start insert along with an instruction booklet  in several languages. I opened everything, glanced over the instructions, and was eager to begin snapping photos.

Well, thats where my problems began. My first bit of advice is to not only carefully read the instructions, but, in some cases, follow them to a tee! What do I mean? Adding new film? Make sure the camera is turned off. I forgot to turn the camera back off and added my film. It confused the camera. It would not do anything, and it didnt give me an indication that it recognized I added a film cassette. I had to turn the camera off, remove the film, and re-insert the film before it recognized the cartridge. I also recommend charging the unit prior to use. I first used the black and white film. That didnt go well. Something had happened to the film. The pictures would come out with random unprinted areas. I almost thought I had done something wrong  maybe I did. All I know is I had 8 very bad photos. I decided to just move on. I added a color cassette, following the instructions on the guide. First photo Good picture! Finally, the Polaroid I remember. It seemed a bit cumbersome to get started, but that may be because I have now become accustomed to the ease of non-mechanical photography. The photos generated by this camera must be kept out of the light for about 5-10 minutes while they develop. They shouldnt be shaken or blown on  not what I remember as a kid. The photos looked pretty good. They were a bit of an improvement over the Polaroid of old. It would be nice if there was a higher grade of film providing and even better output.

Next, I tried connecting the One Step Plus to my phone. Downloaded the Polaroid Originals app, enabled the Bluetooth on the camera, and Nothing. The instructions say that the camera will just begin pairing when you open the app. So, of course I shut down the app and restarted Nothing. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Nothing. It appears I needed to tap the red One Step+ button, but this was not stated in the instructions. Once I did that, the device synced. The Polaroid Originals app allows you to have a greater level of control over the camera, doing things like remote picture taking, combining double photo snaps, sound activation, timer triggered photos, light painting, and manual control of the camera  aperture, exposure, etc. This is a nice suite of tools that work well with the camera. I will say, I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting at least one more feature: The ability to take a photo and transfer a digital copy to the phone. As far as I can tell, that functionality is missing from the One Step Plus. I feel this alone would have taken this device to another level  One Step Plus  Digital, maybe?

I like the Polaroid One Step Plus. It is a neat camera for taking quick photos when you want an immediate hard copy. Im hard pressed to feel this can become preferred over a mobile phone camera, or any other digital shooter. The lack of a digital presence hurts it, in my opinion. The shape of the camera is great for the purposes of nostalgia (looks like one of the early models), but it is large, by todays standard, and that makes for a difficult choice when travelling or moving about. This one is all about feel, in my opinion. If youre feeling a bit of old school vibe, this is the device for you, but all others will probably not see the need."^4^Sep 19, 2018 6:46 PM
TECHBEENGOOD^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Polaroid Originals OneStep+
Its possible to reach back in time in your photography, recreating those analog processes you (or your grandparents) once considered state-of-the-art. Grab this grapefruit-size (and weight) Polaroid camera. Make sure its been charged and loaded with either the B&W or color film (8 image packs), and youre ready to capture family events, or special projects, or create some art. As long as youve got a mobile phone in your pocket anyway, the Polaroid (iOS/Android) App lets you accomplish special effects (double exposure, light painting and long exposures) was well as other timing controls. The Polaroid Originals One Step+ offers a very different approach to picture-taking that can be recommended to imaginative and motivated photographers. 

SETUP: Out of the box youll want to charge up the One Step+ for a couple of hours which prepares you for shooting 15-20 packs of film. There is an included Micro-USB to USB cable, but no charging wart. The large, EASY-to-read startup guide will familiarize you with the camera and the film loading process. Bluetooth connection is a bit different. Slide down the back panel RED POWER button and find the BT + button on the front panel and press. Make sure your Bluetooth is on in you mobile phone, but dont try to link from there. You need to be in the Polaroid App which is downloaded from either the Apple or Android App stores. I needed a few tries to get connected . . . I think. The BT LED stayed solid but the App was non-responsive after the first tries. Like I said, it all worked, eventually, but Im not sure when or what I did in those head-scratching minutes. There is a SCANNING feature in the APP which lets you scan your finished photos (and anything else, actually) so you can add these photos to your digital collection. This is especially nice if your Polaroids are in demand and you want your own copy. Couldnt do that back in the 1950/60/70s.

PERFORMANCE: TAKING PICTURES was as easy as Polaroid photography has even been.  Select the correct lens with the top panel slide based on your distance from the subject,  Choose the flash setting (go brightest unless in direct sunlight  trust me),  Aim and Press the Red Trigger button to take your picture. The picture pops out of the front tray and around 15 minutes later youve got your developed 3 x 3 photo. Its retro, but there is still a magic to it all. Ive grown accustomed to the easily after-the-fact exposure corrections on my phone, so I was disappointed with the darker images I kept getting. Id also add that images in color were not as contrasty, colorful or as sharp as weve come to expect. Some of this was my fault, cause real photos demand real lighting which I wasnt supplying. B&W pictures were more satisfying on every count. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: Students, scientists, artists, designers and serious photographers will get a nice set of tools by using the Polaroid App to exploit their creativity or address their unique needs for an instant-print camera. The B&W film resulted in nice photos, color pictures were just OK, but be sure to provide sufficient illumination. The fully manual exposure controls, the ability to do tricks by painting with light, and easily controlled double exposures are all useful for the right person. The Polaroid One Step+ is recommended for the serious photographer looking for another tool. Many casual photographers will wonder why they need more than a mobile phone with camera and will be frustrated with the effort and outcome."^3^Sep 19, 2018 5:28 PM

This is really a niche product that doesn't do anything really well enough to warrant a purchase.

Right off the bat I had to deduct two stars simply for the fact that the film is way over-priced. $2 per pic is a real deal breaker. Going forward, if they can cut the price at least in half, that might make this a little more palatable. The picture quality isn't very impressive after modern digital cameras have spoiled us. 

This instant camera is a fun novelty for that person who has everything and loves retro styled merchandise. If you aren't one of these people, chances are the price of the camera and especially the price of the film won't make it worth a buy."^2^Oct 3, 2018 3:29 AM

InsaneDiego^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"1970 called and it wants it's camera back! Nostalgic people can rejoice that the beloved Polaroid camera is back! Make no mistake. This is not like any camera you are using today. You will not find crystal clear super colorful images. Instead you get muted or slightly faded colors with images that are less than pristine. One of the main differences between this version and the original 1970 version is the speed of development. I am old enough to have had the original and it seemed like you'd have you picture in about 5 minutes. This new version takes about 15 minutes before the image is fully developed. Keep in mind that this camera uses film. I'm sure you knew that if you are reading this but I'll say it again. It uses film. That means you have a limited, very limited actually, number of shots. 8 to be exact. The film is not cheap. I wish they could get the price of the film down substantially. Right now it's running about $2 a picture. I'd like to see that cut in half. That's the short story. Now for the downsides.

The camera uses a rechargeable battery. The quick start guide should have said to charge the camera as step 1. It makes no mention of this. The main marketing thrust of this version is the mobile app that gives the camera extra functionality. My experience with the app was pretty bad. After starting the app and getting it connected, it wasn't really connected. Ultimately I realized that you are truly connected when the plus button on the camera front is solid blue, not blinking. I had to shut down the app and restart it to get the solid blue. The second issue was that the connection only lasted for one shot. After that I'd have to rinse and repeat. Shut down the app, restart it. Third problem was the app crashing which it did way too regularly. I have it connected to a Samsung Note 4 which isn't that old and it should have been sufficient for a connection. The 3rd and final issue I had with the app was the double exposure. I had it on that screen and when I went to shut down the app my finger must have brushed the shoot button. Tada, you have now made your first shot. Now take another! I had no recourse to undo that action. A bit harsh but I'm not sure what else can be done about this. Just be careful when you are on that screen. Overall, I found that I would rarely use the phone connection. I would tend to use the camera more as it is without the enhancements. The double exposure and time lapse though did work well.

A few issues I had with the camera itself. The flash is always on. There is no 'switch' to turn it off. Instead you have to use two fingers to take the shot. One on the shutter button and another on the back side of the camera to hold in a button to turn off the flash (flash override). I'd much rather have a switch than doing some slight finger gymnastics. Next is the lens setting. You can switch between Portrait and Standard lens. I didn't really notice a difference. We then move to the Lighten/Darken switch. The switch is black on a black camera and the text to say what is lighter and darker is embossed in black. In other words, you need great light to see which way to flip the switch. The most jarring issue was the viewfinder. It was misaligned. It pointed too far down which means that what you think is the top of the photo when you shoot it is really about 1/4 to 1/3 down the photo. That leaves a lot of empty space on the top. Once you know this you can adjust but it's way off so it's a bit strange.

In summary, I really wanted to love this camera. I wanted to be taken back to my childhood. I think it did that to a large extent but there are a series of compromises to get there. It will be great to use for some special occasions but it certainly wouldn't be a camera I'd carry around all the time due to the cost of the film. I wish I could give 1/2 stars out here. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. 1 star off for the cost of the film and 1/2 a star for the different settings that are a bit difficult to set."^3^Sep 21, 2018 3:06 PM
Drummer7^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"With the world of phones with great cameras and DSLRs, it can take some practice to master this one shot, no edit, no zoom, no review method of taking pictures.

This camera is pretty simple to use. The manual is very easy to understand and follow. 

Pairing the camera with the app is very simple, as long as your phone's Bluetooth is on, you just have to press the Plus button on the camera's front and launch the app on your phone. No need for pin numbers or passwords.

The fact that connects to your phone via bluetooth is a great feature and super fun like the double exposures and light painting, which take some practice to get the hang of it!

What I like it most about this camera is that it has a manual mode with control over shutter speed, aperture, and flash power. I also like the remote timer, although I think it was missing the option of live view shooting.

The app shows you battery life, the number of shots left in your film pack, and tells you if the lens is set to distant or close focus. The app also has a built-in photo scanner, so you can share your shot as soon as it develops.

This camera is really great because you get the analog experience but the fine-tuned control of using the app.
The old school feel is still there and the amount of technology added just makes it all more exciting!

Besides the fact that the film is pretty expensive and again, the app does not have the live view shooting option, I would still recommend this, not so little camera, for those that would love the fun experience of taking polaroid pictures!"^5^Sep 20, 2018 10:08 PM
Nabob^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"With the popularity of mid-century modern homes, it only makes sense to bring back one of the iconic technology devices of the 60s and 70s. I had several Polaroid cameras when I was young. One of them was the One Step (SX-70). Now this classic camera comes back as a retro device which now offers modern-day technology. 

The updated 'Polaroid Originals' version of the camera has BlueTooth capability with the addition of an App. In the app, you can view and edit photos taken by the camera. After my initial use I think I'll be using the digital side of the camera versus printing out photos.....but showing my kids what a Polaroid camera did/does took made us go through the first pack in minutes!

It's a little expensive for what you get when you compare the price to digital cameras today. The nostalgic look and feel of the device helps justify the cost. After downloading the App, I was able to get up and running quickly. Generating effects was intuitive and fun. The camera is large and a bit clunky as well, but that's only due to the comparison with the the size of today's digital devices.

jaybot^/polaroid-originals-onestep-analog-instant-film-camera-white/6333622?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I personally love the look of the older cameras. Its design stays some what true of older Polaroid models. Its a bit smaller than the originals and its all plastic. Being mostly plastic its still a bit heavier than you would expect. Comes with a good manual and starter guide which I found super helpful. A charging cable and a strap so you can hang the camera around your neck.

From my experience you need a lot of light in the shot to get the pics to turn out good. If indoor even with normal light I would still use high flash. After you take the photo shield it from light until it fully develops which takes a few mins. 

From what I can tell the biggest difference between this OneStep+ and the last model the OneStep2 is that this one has bluetooth and a companion app. The app allows you to apply some pretty cool features to the pics. 

I would personally never replace my digital camera with this but I do find myself using it quite a bit. I do find that people love it when I take their picture with this. It just gives that nostalgic feel and retro look to the photo. Something you can hold onto, almost instantly, and you don't get that with most digital cameras. Yes you can apply filters to a digital photo but its still not the same. Its a really awesome thing to have. Oh and don't forget to put some writing on the bottom of the photo to give that finishing touch. I cant really con the quality of the photos or the size of the camera because its does what its meant to do and looks the way its meant to look. I think my biggest concern with this is the price of the photo paper. In all really fun camera."^4^Sep 19, 2018 2:08 PM

My only complaint is the charging system, which requires you to take the battery out and plug it into the proprietary battery charging system. I had thought that you could use the usb data cable and plug it in to charge, but that will not work. This requires you to bring that additional accessory along with you or have multiple batteries, which usually isn't too big of a deal. Aside from that one issue, this item is definitely a good purchase. There are relatively few point and shoot cameras in this price range that also boast the 20 megapixel resolution that this does. -- This review allows only for photos to be uploaded with 5 mb or less of image size and the majority of the images that I have shot with this range between 7 mb and 12 mb, so I found 2 photos that were under this file size that were shot with the camera.

Most of the time in Auto mode most of the features seem to work just fine. It finds faces, focuses, and tracks them well. Changes to Macro for close ups. White balance under different lights keep whites white.
The WiFi has not connected. Have tried twice about a half hour each time before giving up. The memory card fits slot on computer and that works just fine.
My old camera has a dial to set basic Program settings; mountain, portrait, low light, fireworks, vivd color, etc This camera you have to use the screen and function button and then up, down, left, or right function to get to common program modes. Some settings are saved so with one button push you can get back to last setting, others are reset back to factory.
My issue is the mountain program setting which I use very often. First, it is not saved and you have to go thru about five button pushes to reset it. Second, the focus is not locked at infinity, its range is from 9 feet to infinity. Which means it keeps focusing on near objects. From inside my deck doors I know have many pictures of a deck railing in focus an out of focus deer in yard. Also from car I have an in focus guardrail and out of focus bear with cubs in field. There is a work around for the focus issue that takes only a few seconds but sometimes you just dont have the time to push shutter half way and make sure it focuses on main subject; mountain setting should not need to find subject to focus."^3^Jan 21, 2018 6:54 PM

Wifi works good as well, it was the main reason because we bougth the cam. For the price it is completely awesome small 20 pixels camera."^5^Sep 30, 2016 6:37 PM

Knowing that the misplaced camera will eventually turn up, I didnt want to spend a lot but also wanted a decent camera for my trip and this fit the bill. It is smaller and lighter than the camera I cant find at the moment which I enjoyed but its features are a little harder to access because they are somewhat buried in menus. It worked great as a point and shoot even without the additional features. I took the book with me but never got around to reading it. I played around and managed to find the settings I wanted but am sure it does way more if I would take the time to learn about it. I do like the 10X zoom and got some great pictures so all in all, I am pleased. I deducted one star simply because I prefer my other camera that has a dial for commonly used settings like macro, scenery etc so that you dont have to waste time navigating thru menus."^4^Nov 17, 2017 11:19 PM

When you turn the camera off it remembers some settings but does not remember them all. Thus if i have to take a Macro shot, i have to go into the menu and scroll to the Macro setting EVERY time i turn the camera on. Unfortunate for me i use the Macro a lot so it is nuts.
Everything else is very good about the camera however, takes nice pictures, a little better than my older A3100IS Canon. Zoom is better, wide angle is better, Movie picture size is larger and file format is smaller so less bytes for a movie. it would be the perfect camera if it remembered the Macro setting. I would recommend it to anyone that does not take a lot of Macro shots for sure."^4^Nov 14, 2016 5:02 AM

LowerEastSider^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5298402?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^57^3^"I looked at much more expensive cameras but settled on this one because it generally had good reviews and was just small enough to fit into a pocket.

I did not want to spend a lot of money on something that could get damaged, dropped or stolen.

The picture quality is above average without a lot of graininess or artifacts. Even when zoomed-in to a reasonable level on a large screen monitor, most photos look very detailed. And, the colors are quite pleasing and natural looking.

It is best at taking still photos. That being said, when I set the camera in burst mode, I was able to get some decent shots at a recent bike race. But there are better cameras with faster lenses if you plan on taking a lot of action shots.

The 'P' mode offers some controls for things like exposure level and white balance. But this is a camera designed primarily for automatic use. There is no function dial, so you must go into the menus to make changes to the settings.

The camera does a better than average job of taking good photos using the auto mode. And, even in the program mode, it still operates mostly automatically.

The 25X zoom range is certainly more than adequate for most users.

This is not one of those cameras that amazes you with it's shot to shot speed. But for most people it is more than adequate.

You will not feel like you have a 'brick' in your pocket or purse with this camera. It is quite lightweight and not too long or wide. The next most expensive Cannon model offers better performance, but it is (in my opinion) simply too large and heavy to tuck in a pocket.

I bought a small canvas case that I hook to my belt. This keeps the camera protected and it is always ready for use.

This camera is a good value for someone who is not a 'camera person' but wants pleasing, lifelike photos. You could spend additional money and get more features, but not necessarily better quality photos."^4^Jul 2, 2018 7:26 PM

BattyFoto^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5298402?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^26^8^"First let me say this. This camera is nice and good for this price range, which is why it has 4 stars and I would recommend it....
 If you can get past the following points...
**Please note though, the whole purpose of this purchase was for a higher megapixel camera that could give me crisp macro (close up) photos of my artwork. 

That being said, here's my opinion:
1. This camera is tiny! Think almost flip phone size, which makes it very awkward and hard to grip right with average adult hands.
2. Very impressive zoom photos. I used it to take exterior detail photos for an insurance claim. When I took 2nd floor photos of the details around windows, you would have thought they were first floor! So it did what I needed it to there.
3. No cords come with it. You take the battery out to charge it using a plug in adapter. 
4. I ended up not being able to get it to connect to my laptop at all, so I just took the memory card out each time. This was a let down.
5. Cannon menus are a bit confusing to me. My son has a T5, which I tried to use a few times before and couldn't get the hang of things. Beginners be careful and really read the manual and try how to videos online.
6. There's a clicking noise it makes. It's the small metal pieces making up the lense protector. So when it's closed/off, for some reason mine made noises when I moved it around. Just an annoyance.
7. Okay here's the main reason I took it back. The closer shots were not as impressive as I expected per the many reviews saying it's good for that. I'm sure it's better than average though. However, in my case, I need really detailed photos of my artwork to be able to make prints of good quality. This did not deliver. Now, I might have been expecting way too much for a $200 range camera, but I was just going by other's opinions. 
So there ya go. This is just MY humble opinion also lol.
I would call myself a hobbiest photographer. Not an expert, but more than a beginner.
Thank you!"^4^Aug 9, 2018 7:24 AM

TexasFlyer^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5298402?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^2^"I'm glad I bought it but it has a few issues. The battery did not last very long and stopped charging after one charge. It told me it wasn't a real Canon battery. That was problematic because I bought it just prior to going on vacation to have a better camera than my IPhone 7. I found two aftermarket batteries and a car charger on the road and they worked so well, I really only needed one. It is a much better camera, than the IPhone 7, but my biggest disappointment was my inability to get decent photos of the stars and moon in the desert sky. I tried every setting for hours and hours. Vibrant is a little too 'vibrant' It will take a woman's face from 'discreet' to saloon hooker. LOL. The Zoom feature was the best part. For my taste, it has a few too many artsy settings to throw fairy dust on your photo but I guess to each his own. I guess the sad part is that I will probably need to run all my vacation photos--- (600) through a photo app or software before I post them. But they are good photos to start with. But my wife just bout an IPhone 8 and it takes a better standard picture than this camera if you don't need zoom and 20mp density photos. The other nice thing is that adding another 600 photos to my IPhone might start giving me memory issues, at least with cloud back up. So I am glad I bought it, but will use it for the zoom feature in the outdoors mostly."^4^Nov 25, 2017 4:25 AM

The battery is a chargeable battery. It doesn't come charged out of the box, so be prepared to have time to charge it. (I learned the hard way - I took it on vacation still in the box.)

The best price and features for this type of camera, it has a 1/2.3' sensor, which is standard for cameras around this price, it records in HD which is a plus, I think the way the flash works on this camera is very convenient, if you want flash then you pop out the flash with a button on the side of the camera, you don't have to click on the menu, scroll down, select flash, etc etc. It is very easy to use, the only complaint I have is that the screen is a little blurry to me, the specs say that it is a High Resolution screen but it is not, it looks high resolution when the pictures are reviewed on the camera but not while focusing, so it is a bit misleading.

To power the camera up, you have to try and push the little power button on top. I had to use my finger nail to push the recessed button down.

They eliminated the auto flash like the older model had. So if you are taking pictures and the sensors decide you need a flash, you leave your shot, twist the camera sideways to find the little slide button then you raise the flash by using your fingernail to push the tiny little recessed button on the left side.to pop the flash up. Then you go back to your shot.

The other buttons on the screen side are close together and recessed. You have to be right on to push them or you will push the wrong one. The dial around the Func set button is small and when you attempt to push on the outside ring, there's a good chance you will also hit the func set button that you didn't want to push. There are 4 buttons around that dial that are also recessed and close together. Not easy to use.

The door on the right side which you open to get to the HDMI cable hook ups is held by two little plastic strips which I have a feeling would not last that long.

Well, this camera does not. I ordered one on Amazon for $5. How am I suppose to transfer photos if I am at someone's home or a location when wifi or removing the memory card is not an option? You will need the cable. 
The free memory card is to small to be practical. The SanDisk Extreme PRO 128GB SDXC is not stocked at the BB store. Available for half the price at Amazon. That is the best card for this camera. (the micro card is to slow). BB would not give credit toward a better memory card. The free card is a wasted product.
Finally, no storage or travel case. 
So, after you buy this camera you need a transfer cable, better memory card and travel/purse case. I would not give this as a gift because it is not a complete package. More a fault of Canon than BB. What's next? Charging extra for a battery charger?

SteveNunez^/nikon-coolpix-p1000-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6275507?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^27^0^"If you're looking at the P1000 chances are you're already familiar with it's zoom capabilities. It has the largest zoom range of any digital camera on the market and works equally well for 4K video. The mic input means super high audio quality for your videos. 
This can be the ONE camera that works for all occasions- from portraits to wildlife- this camera can do it all.
The downsides are it's small sensor. It is not well suited for low light photography or video and will not produce those beautiful 'out of focus' backgrounds many people prefer.
If wildlife is your passion and you typically shoot in good lighting this camera's zoom will produce nice images. It can't beat a large sensor camera in outright image quality but it will capture subjects other cameras simply cannot. So if catching that hawk up a tree eating a squirrel is your type of photography- this camera is great for that type of telephoto video/photography work.
The camera is a bit large and moderately heavy but definitely lighter than any interchangeable camera with a long zoom lens.
So if you're looking for that ultra-zoom lens camera for extreme telephoto videography or photography- this is the camera for you!
Just be aware it's aimed at long range shooting and will not produce amazing images for close-up photography like events or portraits- there are better choices for that type of photography.
The P1000 is the 'wildlife' photographers dream for static subjects in good lighting.
When I'm walking around with my P1000 I know there's nothing I cannot shoot with this camera- it's a good all-around camera solution if you can only have 1 camera.
(I've included 2 sample shots of wild iguanas in Florida taken with my P1000)"^4^Oct 26, 2018 5:31 PM
JRSBB^/nikon-coolpix-p1000-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6275507?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^0^"NOTICE: Owner of several Brand cameras like Sony A7RIII, RX10 III, Olympus OM-D E-M1, and Panasonic Leica point and shoot cameras. Use them all for specific types of photography/video where they excel.

I bought this for shooting airshows and long distance shots. Took it out to my first airshow the prior weekend on a very cloudy and overcast day and was very happy with the performance. The big concern was the sensor size and how well it would perform. The photos were fantastic - color reproduction was just excellent like other Nikons I used in the past. I had other owner that advised me to adjust some settings so I was not shooting Auto mode. I was also using the Nikon Red Dot DF-M1. Got a lot of great photos. Even when shots are over or underexposed, the color is amazing. Now with the RAW photos, you can post process for some great shots. 

The size and weight was not an issue. Ergonomics are great. Now for the big surprise. You would not think this camera would be good for indoor photos. I had a birthday party right before airshow and needed the practice with camera so I used that indoors. Amazing shots with the built-in flash - just don't get too close as it may blow out the shot. Not an issue with the zoom lens on this thing to stand back a bit and get some great shots. A big plus was some of my subjects did not feel the intimidation of someone with a camera up in their face and I got some great impromptu shots.

I have not tried any macro shots and can't wait to try them on some of my mother's plant garden. Some of the stuff others have posted were impressive. Seems that this camera overachieves in many areas you would not expect but you need to learn to use it properly. Can't wait until I can learn more to see what other spectacular stuff I can get out of it.

This camera shines when you take it out of Auto mode. Learn to use it and you will be rewarded greatly. The number of menus and options have been heavily reduced to allow you to learn all those cool features to get you shooting great shots in no time. But it still retains continous mode and other advanced options."^5^Nov 10, 2018 1:32 PM

Stelyos^/nikon-coolpix-p1000-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6275507?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^11^2^"OK, first off lets make a clear defining line between DSLRs and Point and shoot cameras. This is in comparison to other Point and Shoot cameras, DSLR's in a professional setting will yield much better pictures. Having said that, for a high power zoom camera, point and shoot there really isn't as good as the P1000. A few points to keep in mind. 
1. the battery doesn't last long. you will have to buy more for all day shooting.
2. the app is very slow to connect and to transfer pictures. I use an apple dongle to transfer the SD card memory to my iPad so that I can edit on the fly 
3. it's heavy. I use to take one hand over-head shots of car engines and now I have to use both hands because my wrist isn't strong enough to hold it steady 

Now unto the good/cool stuff...
1. the zoom!! the normal optical zoom lets me see inside craters of the moon. With image stabilization it's no problem to zoom in without a tripod, it can be done, you can rest your elbow on a table or lean against a wall. 
2. macro shots... if you flip the macro shot on, you can take pictures of the watch movements and things like that, very clear and sharp.
3. portraits have excellent color rendering, even in halogen lights.
4. normal photos are quite unbelievable. many people think I didn't take some of the photos I've taken because of how great they look in comparison to the lighting conditions where they were taken.
5. it accepts 512gb SD cards... yes, I tried in my previous Sony and that caps at 128gb, the P1000 doesnt' mind.
6. I used to prefer using the flip lcd screen as a viewfinder, but with this camera, I've found it easier to use the normal viewfinder and rarely use the lcd screen
7. the bird setting lets you catch birds mid flight

Fred^/nikon-coolpix-p1000-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6275507?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I read many, many reviews for the P1000. I almost did NOT buy based on the reviews. From what I read the negatives for this camera are; small sensor size; problems with auto focus at 3000mm zoom; heavy (3#); expensive; not a professional grade camera. What I found was GREAT pictures and video with the ability to zoom to 3000mm! The auto focus at max can be tricky but you are seldom at max, you can use manual focus if needed. The lens is a little slow, but the stabilization adds a stop or two. This camera is made for the bright outdoors. Heavy, a little, but what a great lens. Small sensor, yes, that is how they get the 3000mm but the results are excellent. (Side note: this is really a ~530mm lens with a crop multiple of~ 5.6) Will you use this camera every day? Probably not but if you want amazing zoom photos and video there is nothing better in the price range. I have taken many great pictures and video of things I had not dreamed of because of the zoom capability. I would not recommend this camera to everyone but for those that want the ultimate in zoom capability this camera can not be beat. I am more than pleased with the P1000!"^5^Feb 9, 2019 10:39 AM

I like the Wi-Fi ability to shoot pictures remotely and to have the pictures immediately downloaded to my phone.  There are two buttons toward the top to be careful with. One is the manual versus automatic focus. If youre not careful, you can accidentally switch from one to the other.  The other button turns the screen blank and turns on the viewfinder."^4^Jul 6, 2019 10:23 AM

Have not used it beyond the optical view, and the clarity is excellent. Very good image stabilization at full telephoto when hand held. I find the manual focus easy to use and eliminates those cases where auto-focus is slow or won't focus on the subject (fast moving, off center when zoomed out, etc.).

The zoom is Amazing on this camera, and the Snap Bridge App for my phone worked flawlessly. As for the rest of this camera I am not impressed. The pics were just OK at best. I had the camera for a couple weeks and I tried to get used to this monster piece of equipment. The unit itself is almost 5lbs. Yes I know Im weak. However try sitting with your lens zoomed out at a sports game taking some photos of youre child. NO good. I also noticed on a far zoom anything over the 1/2 way point I got a lot of haze in my pics almost like a smoke screen. I changed some settings and used automatic mode and still had nill results. The moon pics I was able to take with this camera were really cool photos, maybe because it was dark out and I used the automatic moon mode. But those photos also should be done with a tripod since the weight of the unit makes the camera a lil shaky in my hands. This is definatly a camera that needs one hand holding the camera ready too press
the shutter button, and the other hand held firmly on the lense base to get a photo. I also tried 2-3 different tripods and when fully zoomed the front end weight of this camera kept moving the tripod top piece slightly down. Causing me to possibly over tighten the tripod nut. This leads me into the next part of this camera. The screw down hole on the base of this camera does
not appear much different then that of its predecessor the P900 which had a lot of issues. Even though it appears the manufacturer reposition the screw hole on this camera the plastic base/frame on this camera looks like it could be a recipe for disaster. My end result is the camera was returned, it was too big and heavy at zoom to justify carrying it around on a daly basis to snap and transfer Pics to my phone. I would say this is more of a specialty camera for far zoom shots but the quality is
Not really there on the photos so for me it was not good for everyday use. If I had more funds too play with, I Would consider buying it for a novelty, start gazing and distant animal shots not expecting super clarity on the photos. So some advice is maybe wait till the stores have this camera on display before you buy it, then just hold it and see how big and obtrusive it is. Almost funny looking and its HEAVY."^2^Sep 27, 2018 1:31 PM

Im not even going to get into the cool new features. Canon has a lot of sponsored YouTubers that can show that stuff off. My opinion is based on the reality of actually using the camera. And it hasnt been good. That focus complaint is real. The touchscreen focus is hit or miss. But the face detect focus is broken. Sometimes the white box does seem to identify faces but it just wont focus. I know the common complaint is that a 2020 camera should have Dual Pixel autofocus built in, but the bigger problem to me is that this seems like a focus downgrade from the previous model. 

I really like this camera so Im tempted to stick with it and hope that a firmware upgrade is on its way. But then again, this is Canon and Im just not sure when/if theyll actually address the problem."^1^Aug 8, 2019 11:01 AM
DavidsAlterEgo^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^0^"I too was really looking forward to this release. A pocketable camera with great form factor that has a fast lens, built in ND filter, microphone input, touch screen menu system, USB-C charging, an easy system to transfer media wirelessly to my phone and a tiny flash that is surprisingly useful.

I pre-ordered it and was excited to add this to my photography arsenal alongside my other Canon cameras. The small size is perfect to carry along every day when the DSLRs stay at home. And the image quality is fantastic IMHO, provided youre shooting static subjects and are able to lock focus.

But.. and its a big but, the autofocus. Its terrible! Seriously, my old Canon S90 has a better autofocus and thats a 9 year old camera.

Additionally, if I even think about taking 4K video in anything but ta walk-in freezer it overheats in no time and locks up on you rendering the camera completely useless until its cooled back off.

I could go on and on about how awful it is, but see for yourself on the various (non-sponsored) reviews on YouTube. Its so bad, Im embarrassed for Canon and this is coming from a Canon fan with storm cases full of their products and former employee..

I honestly dont think Ive ever been so disappointed in a camera which is a shame because this one had so much potential."^1^Aug 12, 2019 7:59 PM
MadMensch^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^20^6^"I pre-ordered this camera the day it was announced as a replacement to our G7X Mark 2. The main feature I really needed was the Mic input, and the 4K option was nice as well. 

Thus far weve recorded a couple videos for our YouTube channel (The Montes Family) and if you watch the video titled How well do we know each other? youll notice the camera goes out of focus at certain points in the video and seems slow to correct. All previous videos on our channel were shot on the G7X Mark 2 and we didnt have that issue with the Mark 2. So it seems the concerns about autofocus on the Mark 3 are legit. My only hope is that the issue is fixed in a future firmware update because its unacceptable for a camera at this price point.  

The only reason Im keeping the camera is because I do like the fact that I can now connect my Rode mic directly and I no longer have to sync audio. Other similar compact cameras such as the Sony RX100 do NOT have a mic input so alternative options are limited. 

Other things to keep in mind; 4K video is limited to 9 mins per shot and the camera now requires a USB-C cable to connect to your computer (not included). I did have issues accessing my media directly from my MacBooks finder app, but was able to finally retrieve the media once in Final Cut Pro. Overall, I really wanted to love this camera but the autofocus issue has tempered my enthusiasm for now. Ill have to hold off on recommending this 100% until its addressed."^3^Aug 10, 2019 12:59 AM

So the camera comes in, I pop in the battery and my SD card, go into video mode and turn on 4K at 30 fps to do a sample test in excellent lighting and the entire camera falls apart. There box is around my face making it seem like I'm in focus, but nope it's drifting everywhere and once it does lock on focus it loses the moment there's any slight movement.

TLDR: On paper an excellent little compact camera at a great price compared to the RX100 VII, but the autofocus make it completely useless for video which is who this camera is targeted at."^2^Aug 10, 2019 8:53 AM

Vlogging with the camera for Our Micro Family we need a good camera, and this one did not work.  I would be interested in canon releasing a firmware update to improve the camera but the other issue is adobe does not support cr3 the new raw file format from canon so i had raw files I could not edit either.

SlowMN^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III is a high quality camera with many great features. It gives the user extreme portability while allowing for professional level photos and videos.

The camera was paired with the SanDisk Extreme Plus 128 GB UHS-I microSD card, which is ideal for 4k video due to its fast read and write speeds and for storing a large number of high resolution photos. 

Features to note:
* 3' multi angle touchscreen LCD: The touchscreen is responsive and is easy to view from any angle. I did not have any issues with hitting a wrong button. When it is flipped up or down it is firmly attached and doesn't feel like it is going to snap off. The versatility of this screen allows the user to position the camera at angles other cameras could not while maintaining the ability to see what the camera is seeing. I think this is great because nothing is worse than recording something and finding out you or the intended object are not even in the frame! Overall, this screen is well implemented and a great feature.

* 4K video: The camera has the ability to record 4K video at 30 fps and HD video at 120 fps. It can be recorded in both horizontal (landscape) and vertical (portrait) positions. It has a multi angle touchscreen that can be flipped up 180 degrees so the user can see themselves while recording in both the horizontal or vertical orientation. Streaming is only available on YouTube and there are some additional requirements/limitations. There is the option to add an external mic to the camera in addition to the standard stereo quality mic that is included; however, the standard microphone delivers clear sound. Lastly, there is a HDMI output so videos can be played back on a large TV. These features allow the user to create high quality videos without needing to purchase a stand alone video camera. The quality of the videos are excellent, especially when recording in 4K. 4K is very power intensive/heat producing and I found recording shorter segments (a few minutes at a time) was the most efficient so the camera wouldn't get too hot. When recording in lower resolution, the camera did not experience any overheating issues. If you are thinking about vlogging/streaming or creating home/casual videos, this camera hits the mark.

* WiFi/Bluetooth technology to transfer photos/videos: Using WiFi technology, it was straight forward to transfer files from the camera to a smart phone. I used an iPhone 11 Pro Max running IOS 13.3. You download the CameraConnect App from the Appstore and follow the onscreen instructions. It gives you the option to connect via Bluetooth or WiFi. The directions are clear and even the most novice user should be able to successfully pair the camera and phone. ***A note for connecting via WiFi - If you have an installed VPN that connects on demand, you will be unable to connect to the camera until you turn off this option in the VPN settings on.*** Within the App you can turn on/off geotagging on photos if you do not want that information available. 

Please note there was a known issue with auto focus but this has been addressed by Canon with a firmware update on 12/12/2019.

Overall, this camera is excellent. It is compact in size but packed full of amazing features. It allows you to take beautiful high resolution photos with its 1 inch 20.1 MP sensor and up to 4k 30 fps videos. I believe it out-competes all smart phone cameras in both photo and video quality. It is highly competitive in its camera class. I highly recommend this camera."^5^Dec 27, 2019 11:18 PM
drumanji^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I've shot a lot and have had this since day one/launch and with patience I've been getting some decent shots out of this thing. (Lifestyle, product shots, at the beach, indoors.) I was waiting until I could view the RAWs. However, I have to make an effort to make sure what I wanted in focus is in focus. It likes to focus on the background leaving subjects out of focus. Once its locked on though the shots are great. So the AF on stills isn't as bad as with video. But it's so bad for video I don't even consider using it... especially if i wanted to VLOG and can't 'man the camera.' The focus box shows you're the object, but focuses the opposite. It takes ages to finally lock onto focus, but its fickle to lose it again. That and the overheating while using FHD 120p or 4k. I'm also stuck with 30fps as the lowest framerate it can go. If I switch to PAL I can get 25fps at least. That being said I bought this for my wife who never really used cameras other than a cell phone. I wanted something for her that she can literally point and shoot and maybe she'll gain interest in some gear, but I'm having trouble justifying why things don't work or are out of focus for her. Back to video: I've resorted to finding focus on me, for example, and switching to MF to be able to have peace of mind that it wont jump to the background. Of course, I have to make sure I stay the same distance the whole time though. I still have a few weeks before I am out of my return window and I'm hoping they release a firmware fix. If not, then I know what is going to replace this. (Hint: it has 24fps, doesnt overheat, Eye AF etc)

Pros: 
-Size:Feature Ratio
-Ergonomics
-1.8 aperture (W) | 2.8 (T)
-FAST high speed capture
-Touch Screen Menus 
-ND filter
-MIC input
-Flip screen
-Wifi/Bluetooth
-Image Stablization in Video is decent enough (no complaints)
-FHD 120/60 fps
-No crop 4k (take a hint EOS R lol)

What I don't Like:
-no viewfinder
-AUTOFOCUS
-FHD is a little soft
-lack of dual pixel AF
-overheating in 4k and FHD 120p
-no shoe for the mic (not a big deal)
-no 24fps
-contrast focus, not phase detect 
-no LOG profile
-constrained ISO in 4k
-battery life could be better

All that being said, I can get decent results out of the camera, but that is not without putting in some solid effort and patience. Using this thing is tedious. I've never googled or looked up a camera (almost daily) AFTER I bought it to find fixes or to see if others share the same problem. What good is a camera if the pictures you care about aren't in focus? What good is a camera with video if the video isn't in focus and you have to throw out footage? What good is a camera that doesn't let you use it because it overheated?"^1^Aug 20, 2019 11:02 AM
Bren^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"If I can sum up my review in a short manner, it is only that you NEED to ignore these reviews that are outdated and/or ignorant of the fact that Canon has released a firmware update to address the problems this camera was having with autofocus etc. Before I did anything shooting or filming, I made sure to update the firmware first. 

The steps to do this are fairly simple, but there are only a couple of poorly shot videos on the internet that outline how to do it in simple terms. I will give a crack at it in this written review. 

The equipment required is an SD card, a computer with internet access for downloading the firmware update (version 1.2.0 as of December 12th, 2019), and a bit of time. I formatted the card in the settings on the Camera (this wipes it completely clean, so be careful) and then plugged it into the SD card reader for my computer. On Canon's website, I looked up the firmware on the support page where I was able to download the Zipped folder containing the update file and PDFs in different languages on how to perform the upgrade. There are both Windows and Mac OS X versions available. I unzipped this folder and dragged the file PSG7X3_120.FIR onto the SD card (not inside a folder, just the main page). I then flipped the setting wheel to 'P' and pressed the view button to turn it on. On the settings page, go to number 5 and scroll down to firmware. It will show you the current firmware version (1.0.1. is what mine displayed) and it will ask you if you want to update the firmware. Select OK. It will then go through the process and shut off. When you boot it back up to check, it is updated! It then gives you the option of two autofocus modes; Mode 1 is what you want for a quicker, more adaptable autofocus while filming.

The process is simple enough, taking less than 10 minutes, and is worth taking the time to do for a camera whose predecessor is so esteemed and loved by many. 

I hope this review and like I said, ignore the negative reviews that make no mention of updating their camera first with the latest firmware! Thanks for reading this and have a good day!"^5^Dec 23, 2019 6:54 AM
SirGalahad^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"So, I got this to try and increase my quality for my YouTube tech reviews and to possibly use on my Twitch stream for a face cam. For the most part it is a good choice, as it does a lot of things right, but as many other reviews have mentioned, there are some glaring negatives that will make a lot look elsewhere. Im not an expert at cameras. Im almost as run of the mill as you can get. Ive been using my cell phone (iPhone X) to do any of my picture and video recording needs but wanted to upgrade. 

The first thing youll want to do when you receive the camera is install the two firmware updates that have been released since the camera first came out. The first includes an improved autofocus that is substantially better but still doesnt fully rectify the issue. The second adds a 24-fps option to video recordings. Two things that were desperately needed and should have been available at launch. The update process is relatively simple. Its strange to me that this camera has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but you cant download a firmware update through that. 

BUILD QUALITY/USE: 

The materials on this camera are a mix of plastic and metal. Overall, it feels well built. It has a small spot for your thumb on the back right and a small hump on the front right with a matte material to help with grip but because its so small and light its not the most comfortable. Most of the time I tried to use two hands just to insure I didnt drop it. When vlogging there is a nice area to grab even when the screen is flipped up so there shouldnt be any problem there. 

On the front of the camera you have a 20.1 MP, 1-inch sensor, 24-100 mm f/1.8-2.8 zoom lens with a control ring around the lens, which can be used to perform multiple functions such as shutter/aperture control, zoom, EV compensation, and ISO adjustment. On the front right is the small handgrip I previously mentioned. In single shot mode you can track subjects and take advantage of face detection. This works well but as you can see from other reviews, it isnt flawless, and can leave a lot to be desired. These options dont work with burst capture. It supports 4k 30 fps but only for 10 minutes at a time or else it will overheat. You can also do 1080p 120fps slow motion capture, but it is not as sharp as the other modes. Stabilization is good. I didnt have any problems and it was better than my phones. When in focus, image/video quality is very good with low image noise, nice colors, and good detail. There is softness at the edges of the lens and tends to overexpose itself. Image quality and overexposure is better on this camera than on my phone. 

On the top of the camera going left to right you have a power on/off button, shutter release, below the shutter release is the zoom, then a mode dial, and under the mode dial you have an EV compensation control which goes from -3 to +3. All these buttons feel solid without wobble. Some may say they are a bit tight as it can be hard to switch the modes with just your thumb. 

On the rear of the camera, going left to right, top to bottom, you have a high quality (but not quite as high quality as some smart phones) LCD touch screen with an adjustable tilt that goes up, down, and forward for vlogging/selfies. A lock exposure (*), record video button (usually 1080p 30/60fps), a command dial that has four direction presses. On the outside of the command dial is a rotational dial that does the same thing as clicking in a direction. Up is for drive/delete, right for flash on/off/auto, down for info, and left for macro/manual focus. In the center is a q/set button. Under that you have a play button to review previously taken photos/videos on the memory card, and a menu button to adjust settings. By pressing the q-button it gives you a lot of other options to select either through touch or through using the direction buttons to further adjust your picture depending on the setting you are on. 

On the right-hand side, you have a micro-HDMI, USB-C port, and Wi-Fi button. The camera has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Setup is straight forward and easy. Via Bluetooth you can connect to your phone and send pictures and then upload to social media that way. You can also control the camera with that as well. Wi-Fi allows you to upload your photos to certain cloud platforms and certain social media sites. You can live stream directly to YouTube but during a live stream it does not capture the footage to your memory card. In camera charging is supported but it also comes with an external charger. 

On the left you have your flash slider which pops the flash up and a 3.5 mm microphone connector. 

On the bottom right, you have a battery port with the memory card holder. It supports SD, SDHC, and SDXC memory cards. Battery life for my use was great. However, it wont last you all day shooting with a CIPA rating of 235 images. 

PROS:
 Ease of use
 Everything except the auto focus just works and works well. 
 Picture/video quality (at this price point and when in focus)
 Ability to manually control a lot of features. 
 Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. 
 Zoom
 Touch screen
 Excellent pocket camera for vlogging. 
 Works well on streams (twitch) as you can passthrough without anything on the screen. 
 Literally pretty much everything about the product except for price and autofocus. 
 Has better quality photos/video than my iPhone when setup correctly.


CONS: 
 No EVF
 Auto focus is much improved with new firmware update, but it still leaves a lot to be desired. My phones focus is so much better. 
 Battery wont last all day for shooting. 

CONCLUSION: 

This camera is packed full of features and the spec list for this price point is great. Build quality, operation, and ease of use works great except for the focus. It is a good pocket camera that is made as a point and shoot camera for noobies like me. It was easy to setup and learn. Picture/Video quality is good when it is in focus. I have very little negatives. However, the focus leaves a lot to be desired and makes me not want to use the product. As I feel like I spend more time trying to get the stupid thing to focus on what I want than I do making content. It also takes me more time because I must go back and record or take a photo of something if it is out of focus. Or skip forward when editing video to wait for it to focus. You can also miss moments waiting for the camera to focus. Yes, the picture/video quality is better than my iPhone X in all regards. I can also take photos in dark or bright environments better because the lens is better. Though not dramatically and at this price point it is a very hefty tax to pay for it. I reverted to just doing manual mode for almost everything (including focus) and my experience with that is great and has made me enjoy the camera a lot more. But doing so made me learn a lot more about cameras than I was at first expecting.

With all that said. I just dont know if I can recommend this camera strictly due to the focus. As I think the target demographic for this camera is for individuals like me who have very limited knowledge of cameras and just want it to work. But you must fiddle with settings to get the best quality out of it which requires a learning curve. Most reviews from people who know what they are doing dont seem too put off about the focus. Likely because they are doing manual mode in which the camera is great. For those who are more casual users and arent as serious about picture quality and learning new things, then I just dont see why the camera on your cellphone wouldnt be adequate enough and allow you to save $750."^4^Dec 30, 2019 6:26 PM
doop22^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"My knowledge of cameras and photography boils down to can I trust my cellphone to capture my subject quickly, accurately and look good enough on Auto settings to share. But since I received the Canon PowerShot G7 Mark III, I've been trying to branch out and fiddle with White Balance, ISO, Focal Length, RAW and the likes that comes with working with a real camera. I've learned a little bit to get better shots but Auto mode works just fine for me.

Overall, I definitely see the benefits of owning and using a Real camera but just whipping out my phone and snapping my subject such as my cats is just so much easier.

Back to the camera. It's packed full of features that make it a compelling option for a beginner like myself. Has WiFi, and Bluetooth to connect to my phone, laptop or email to get my images to things I use everyday from the app. The charging/transfer over USB-C is a great touch for future proofing. The flippable view finder is great for vlogging if you're into that. 16x zoom helps you get in 

On the downside, the camera has issues with my SD card saying it can't be found or requiring a reformat only to end up working again through a power cycle.

In the end, I do enjoy using the Canon, when I remember I have it around and wish to use it. A great beginner option in features and price until you can get into DSLR and Mirrorless options."^4^Dec 19, 2019 8:53 PM
Njuice^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Although smartphones have made it easier for anyone to be a 'photographer', there is still a need for high quality standalone cameras. The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III continues to prove the need for cameras by offering high end specs but while also conforming to the smartphone era.

PROS:
- Once unpackaged, you notice how small the camera feels and overall how elegant it feels. Its a nice mix of having so weight and form to it so that it feels high end - but not too much to make it feel clunky. I am a big fan of the black design and I think overall its very pleasant to have and hold.
- Set-Up is mainly a breeze! There are a few options you set up on the front end and then its ready to go. Of course you can do a deep dive into the options menu to change preferences etcbut if you want to you could start using this camera almost right out of the box which is great.
- I would highly recommend you utilize the Canon Camera Connect App and I think most users will. This app is overall what you will use to communicate from your smart phone to your camera. It offers tons of great features including taking a pic, quickly transferring that picture to your phone, and then you can edit/post/send that to whatever you need to. Very easy to use and great idea for many people as they want content instantly.
- The 3 inch touchscreen is one of the best feature of this camera. It really provides clarity for the images/videos as well as offers incredible ease of use. The multi-angle view is fantastic when taking different angles but also for the selfie view, its a way where you can take a picture or take video and see exactly what is being taken. It really helps makes your content better overall.
- I was very impressed with how great the 4K video looks on this Camera. It just adds to much depth to whatever you are recording and playback looks wonderful on it. Very pleased that Canon did so well on the 4K!
- Finally, most importantly this Camera takes pictures so well! The lighting is always great, there is great definition in the picture, and the auto-focus is great. I know some people had issues with the focus at first but Canon has a Firmware update out and its essential to download as you should update firmware on anything you use.

CONS:
- The box does not come with a few items I wish it had which is a USB-C Cable, carrying case/pouch, and a memory card. All of those you will have to provide on your own.
- Updating the Firmware requires you to plug your Camera into your computer via a USB-C cable and downloading the firmware from the website. You would think a camera like this could do it all via WiFi with no cables but it doesn't and I think its a step back for the ease of use for the camera user.
 
BOTTOM LINE:
- The Canon G7 X Mark III will make so many people happy: travelers, vloggers, social media users, and those who just want to just capture family memories. It has enough ease of use to just grab it and go, but enough deep features for people who really want to dive into making the best content possible. I used to think my Smartphone took pictures that were just as good as professional cameras, but after using this I know how far off I am!"^5^Dec 18, 2019 9:26 AM
1ShadowFox1^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"We live in a generation of cell phone photographs. And why not? The cameras incorporated in modern cell phones are ridiculous The clarity, processing ability, and convenience because its always there. But can cell phones really compete with a modern quality purpose built digital camera?

My first impression of the Canon Powershot Mark III was that feels SOLID. This camera is heavier than you would think and you can usually tell the quality of a device my how solid it feels. And to dive further, every knob, button, and switch on this camera feels VERY well made. I have no doubt that this camera will survive travel and usage for some time. 

When its comes down to using this camera, my experience has been that there is a STEEP learning curve to it. I am not the most experienced in sophisticated camera usage. I have used my Samsung phone a lot, I LOVE using my variety of GoPros, but I wanted to graduate to a true 'skilled' camera. There are LOTS of settings, the camera will integrate into your phone, it might even fold laundry for you. I have used this camera very heavily throughout the holidays and I am pretty sure I havent even scratched the surface on what this camera is capable of. 

What this camera does not do...FOCUS! I have read reviews prior about this camera and seen the complaints regarding the focus speed of this camera, but Canon came out and said this issue was resolved with a software update. It has not. This camera takes a LONG time to auto focus. I took my daughter to see Santa before Christmas and thought this would be a GREAT opportunity to get acquainted with this camera. Static shot in a controlled environment. Easy, right? NOPE. This camera would NOT focus. After 2-3 minutes of my toddler sitting quietly on Santa's lap and behaving extremely well, this camera would not focus at all and I could not get a picture of my little one with Santa at all. Luckily the retail store Santa was at was supplying free pictures. This is unacceptable to me. There was nothing complex to this photo at all. I was able to catch other family photos in different environments, but none more important than the picture I missed out on.

Also, going from very cold outside to temperature controlled indoors I have had issues with the lens fogging over and taking a long time to become usable again. 

With practice, I believe I will get better with this camera. I have a vacation in May in which I am heading out of country and will be taking this camera with me and video blogging. I am hoping by then I can get more familiar and take all of the great pictures and videos in the world. But I still feel that this camera and its auto focus needs an overhaul. Until then, I really can't recommend this camera.

Long story short...at present time I can not see a reason to bring this camera with you as its difficulty of use and the auto focus is terrible. Your cell phone will do everything you need and them some. This camera will leave you frustrated. Unless you want to video blog exclusively, there are most likely better options for you out there."^3^Jan 9, 2020 7:56 PM

Spartan114^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6359935?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The canon G7X Mark III includes several exciting updates from its predecessor the Mark II, including an input for an external microphone and the ability to livestream directly to YouTube. However, there are also a few key drawbacks of the camera. The biggest of these is probably the autofocus system, which is considerably slower than that of the Mark II. The internal audio for the camera is also lacking, and since there is no hot or cold shoe to attach an external microphone, it is difficult to mount. Hopefully one of the leading microphone companies will come up with a solution to this problem soon. Its 4K abilities are also limited, especially since you cannot record sound when recording in 4K. The camera does well in low light, and is great for quick stills, but it has a ways to go in terms of video. If new firmware updates are able to improve the autofocus system and a company like Rode comes out with a good external mic that sticks to the side of the camera, this will be a great vlogging camera! Until then, I will probably continue to use my Mark II."^3^Dec 22, 2019 5:21 PM

So I had to buy that instead. Its a shame. They didnt give it dual pixel auto focus so its pretty much useless. They make better cameras at a lower price it doesnt even make sense.

Once you do that, the rest of the video normally stays in focus. 

One thing we have loved about this camera is that on the touchscreen, there's a button to start/stop the video. In addition, this camera is AMAZING in low light conditions which has been a huge plus since our house only gets good natural lighting for a few hours every day. 

The Canon G7X mark III also gives a wider picture on video mode which has been nice for vlogging because we're able to fit more in one frame. While we don't normally use a microphone, it's nice that this model can actually have one. 

Overall, we've loved this camera and personally think it's a huge step up from the mark II. The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the autofocus isn't 100% perfect every time you use it."^4^Aug 27, 2019 2:05 PM
CameraGuru^/canon-powershot-sx70-hs-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6302277?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^40^5^"I was excited to get this camera as an upgrade to my 7-year old Canon SX40 that has served me quite well. The SX70 upgrade would offer higher sensor resolution (20 megapixels vs 12 ), wider and longer zoom capabilities, built-in WiFi with smartphone remote control to the camera (this was very exciting to me and did work very well with the Canon app), much higher electronic viewfinder resolution, larger LCD screen display, 4K video, additional creative filters, RAW support and much more.

Now comes the 'however' part....despite the wider and longer lens on the SX70 (21mm - 1365mm) compared to SX 40 (24mm  840mm), the SX70 has a slower lens at wide (3.40 vs 2.70) and telephoto (6.50.vs 5.80). This alone is a contributing factor to noisy/grainy/fuzzy photos in lower light conditions inside, outside at dusk, or an overcast day. Otherwise on a bright day results were more on par, but without using the flash indoors, photos were not crisp and sometimes washed out and/or grainy. Also, further comparing specs, the flash coverage on the SX40 has over a 6 1/2 feet longer range than the SX70 plus does not have a hot shoe for external flash to extend the range.

I know Canon cameras very well and have been a long time user of traditional and digital SLR+bridge cameras for many years. I tested this camera on manual and automatic settings to optimize proper white balance, metering, focus and also tried out several special (filter) effects. I experienced some good results, but mostly were disappointing and did not meet my minimum expectations.

I also found the electronics to be rather quirky. Though I havent experienced a humming noise during video recording as stated by another poster, I have seen other weirdness. For example to name a couple, the flash icon indicator would sporadically blink indicating to raise the flash, even in bright outdoor shooting with wider focal length. Also I noticed while focusing hold (holding the shutter down  ways to lock-in), the frame would not always continue to remain locked-in once fully focused and ready to shoot. Instead, it would stray from my locked focus and become out-of-focus prior to a full shutter release, forcing me to release the shutter and try again. Other oddities included seeing a yellow (cautionary) message around the focus frame with an exclamation mark (no explanation in the manual). Also on the display, twice there was a lens retraction error, the camera will shut down message! Indeed, the camera did shut down, so had to power back up to continue. There were other unusual occurrences as well.

I tried and wanted to LOVE this camera with all the upgrades and 'improvements' but am disappointed and cannot recommend the SX70 based on my own experience."^2^Jan 15, 2019 10:03 AM

I also have a Canon 6D MKII which I use for serious photography. When I got the new SX70 HS, I was surprised how much the controls that are like the EOS line of cameras. I like the wireless and bluetooth capabilities but I found the wireless connection unreliable so I use a third party bluetooth shutter release instead.

One big disappointment is the lack of HDR mode that I used a lot with the SX40 HS.  I was able to use the camera to take some nice pictures of humming birds in my back yard and am, over all, very happy with the purchase.

I work with many different manufacturers photo equipment as part of my job. When my wife wanted to replace her old Canon Powershot(very old and still working) we went camera hunting. She was looking for a camera that was small in size, had a viewfinder, and had a decent focal range. The SX70 was the winner. This camera has the widest focal range of most point and shoot cameras we looked at. It was small and light, had a good high resolution chip, and is even capable of shooting RAW files. I may be old school but using a camera without a viewfinder is just not smart. There will always be conditions where it would be nearly impossible to see the display screen, especially in bright sunlight. It can also be very difficult to frame a photo with a steady hand, especially when using telephoto ranges. This camera checked all the boxes."^5^Apr 6, 2019 11:29 AM

For those of us whose phone has a crummy camera, the W800 provides a pocket sized camera at a very low price.

The W800 has three auto modes but takes its best photos in program mode with the ISO locked to 200. That mode enables you to adjust exposure to make a photo brighter or darker and boost ISO to 400 for flash photos and get faster shutter speeds for photos of sports, kids, pets and other fast moving subjects.

Sony uses a two stage shutter button. Press it slightly to focus. A steady green light shows focus is locked. Then press further to release the shutter.

The folks who complain about blurred photos should practice the two step shutter release and practice holding the camera rock steady when pressing the shutter.

Outdoor photos in bright sunlight are excellent and photos in deep shade are adequate. You can take good closeups of flowers outdoors from a foot away but you need to set ISO at 200 and use a tripod or support to keep the camera very still for sharp results.

The optical zoom lets you use a wide angle view to cover a large area and then zoom in for a much closer view.

The one page of instructions gets you started. Press on the menu button and then practice the dozens of special modes and settings until you fully understand all of the options the W800 offers.

The W800 is the smallest and lightest camera with an optical zoom lens in its price range. It matches the quality of the iPhone camera at a much lower price."^4^Apr 28, 2015 10:52 PM
Steventhestephanos^/sony-dsc-w800-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4349004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^44^0^"I like Sony's approach to a digital camera. It is easy to shift from still mode to movie mode. But unlike previous versions of this camera, once in movie mode, the owner cannot go to zoom; the viewer has to first zoom in, than start the movie mode--and cannot zoom out. But on the whole, for the price it is a great camera, a flexible camera. People say pixel size doesn't matter. I have low pixel cameras, and taking a distance picture makes for an impressionistic photo; a larger pixel camera seems to give greater clarity to those distance shots. And when you live in a place like San Francisco which has great scenic views--clarity of pictures is a must. This camera is more than adequate tot it's task. There is also a handy dandy recharger for the battery which is really helpful."^5^Sep 26, 2014 5:18 PM

My DSLR is wonderful, but just too large to carry around for occasional photos through the day. My phone camera is very convenient, but not very good at night shots. This camera is the perfect combination of both extremes. At 4 inches by 2.5 inches, it's small size is a definite plus. Slips into my work bag pocket without picking up a lot of space. I carry it easily in my shirt front pocket or pants pockets and hardly know it's there. Photos aren't DSRL quality, but that's expected with a camera this size and price range (though it's better than my phone camera with night shots). The only negative is the flash is situated in an awkward position in the front and my middle finger blocks the flash sometimes. Holding the camera one handed (in your right hand), most people put their thumbs on the back, index finger on the shutter button, and their other finger curl around the front and side of the camera. The problem is your fingers sometimes get in the way of the flash and your photo is only half lit or not lit at all. Use this camera with two hands and you should be okay."^4^Sep 11, 2016 9:07 AM

2) You have to buy a separate SD card, OK I get that, but then you also need a computer with an SD card reader built in, or you will have to purchase a USB card reader, which was my solution, to transfer the images to your computer..

For an inexpensive camera it has a good menu selection for various photographic compositions.
Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, Night Scene, High Sensitivity (for low-light and no flash), Gourmer--for food pix, Pet, Beach--for waterside scenes, and Snow--for very bright scenes. It also offers a steady shot mode. This camera is even equipped with facial recognition. All these features 10 years ago would have cost a bundle, now they're packed into this (too) tiny package.

This camera proves that these days you don't need to pay a lot to get good features in a basic camera. It's small enough to drop in your pocket for a quick go-anywhere camera.

Decent resolution, nice settings, and reasonable shutter lag make this a handy grab-and-go camera that isn't going to hog your pocket or break the bank.

OccasionalBuyer^/sony-dsc-w800-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4349004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^7^"I bought and kept this camera because it is rechargeable. That part is great and I love it.

But I have yet to find a way to take photos I actually like. My old camera, a Canon, with way less capability, took nice clear, crisp photos with no adjustments whatsoever on my part. If it didn't finally break, I'd still be using it, despite the batter-eating.

But every photos this camera takes is just not crisp. I like to photo my garden to keep track of what bloomed when, and it does that, as far as being able to identify what the flower is, but distance shots are the worst. And I'm only talking maybe 20 feet away. They're just not nearly as clear as my old camera. 

I will continue to experiment with different settings, but I shouldn't have to. Like I said, my old 10 megapixel Canon, probably 7 years old, took great shots with no adjusting on my part at all! I could clearly see every leaf on every plant. This camera makes foliage look like a haze of green many times.

I am VERY disappointed, and can't recommend it at all, unless you just want that one good feature, being able to recharge the battery from your computer or a wall plug. (Easiest to do it from PC when I upload photos.)"^2^Mar 31, 2017 6:00 PM

I was hooked by the ISO 3200 setting, which allows me to take pictures in concert settings without a flash. It still requires a steady hand, but my cellphones were never able to produce any good photos in those low-light settings.

Minor annoyances on first use: Don't try to remove what looks like a paper coating on the lens. It belongs there to protect the lens cover. Also, the battery can be inserted the wrong way or the right way. Double-check the contacts to make sure you get it right. These are only first-time problems.

I got a great price on this camera at Best Buy, and it is so tiny that it has become my go-to camera when I don't want to haul around a large SLR. Picture quality is excellent, and you can go full auto or manually set everything. It holds your manual settings even if you power 'off.'

It has a decent amount of options for allowing decent control over exposure while still having automatic options for in-the-moment shots. It is a 20 megapixel camera but it's a bit wasted as the lens really doesn't pick up the detail to justify that size in most cases. I have an older 5 mpx camera with a terrific lens that picks up detail much better. Thankfully you can easily adjust the memory size of each picture. All in all if you need something small to get the job done and you want a dedicated camera this not a bad purchase for the price."^4^Jul 7, 2018 2:25 AM

The microphone is okay and picks up sound very good. It has options such as continuous picture frame capture and takes excellent panoramic shots. It is very light weight and fits very discreetly in your hand or pocket. All of this for about $100 bucks.

ReviewedByPhil^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^18^0^"The Canon Ivy Cliq+ is the first instant camera Ive owned since the 90s; its also the first digital version of such a device Ive used, so I was really interested to see how the quality would stack up versus its retro SLR counterpart.

Lets start off with what I liked about the Ivy Cliq+, namely its compact form factor, simplicity, and ease of use. The camera is basically point-and-shoot, with no zoom or focus controls, no advanced camera settings, nor involved setup. The ring light/flash are set by a physical toggle switch next to the power button, and your only other setting is the photo size: a 2x2 inch square or full 2x3 inch print. After you load in the ZINK paper, charge it up, and power it on, youre ready to take snaps and have them print instantly. If you want to save your digital images for re-printing or editing later, just load a microSD card up to 256GB and your images will be saved automatically, and a built-in reprint button lets you reprint the last photo taken for instant duplicates to share with friends and family.

However, because the unit has no LCD, you cannot review your photos beforehand nor edit them on camera prior to printing. Also, the only way to frame your shot is via the glass viewfinder, or using the 2 inch silver selfie mirror situated around the lens when taking selfies. In case youre wondering, theres no cancel button if you mess up a shot. So like the instant cameras of yesteryear, there are no take-backsies or do-overs. Once you press that shutter button, youre committed to getting a print of whatever is captured. 

The situation is a little bit different if you pair your smartphone via Bluetooth to the Cliq+. When you do this, the camera basically acts as a mobile Bluetooth printer, allowing you to take photos with your smartphones camera which, if its a contemporary flagship phone, probably has better resolution and quality than the 8MP sensor in the Cliq+ or you can select photos from your device and various online storage and social media sources like Facebook, Google Photos, Drop box, and Instagram (requires you to sign in and connect to those accounts). The app allows you to add text, stickers and borders, or draw on the photos before printing them; you can also apply AR effects and masks when taking photos like those found on Snapchat. If you like your new creation, you can save it for re-printing or sharing later on social media, but it doesnt do this by default, you have to explicitly hit the save icon.

You can also use your phone as a remote control for the camera over Bluetooth, but again, it wont display what the camera sees and once you click the shutter the printer activates instantly. Unless your phone doesnt have Bluetooth or the camera isnt as good as the one in the Cliq+, its almost always a better option to simply use the camera as just a mobile printer for your smartphone because you have more options and flexibility.

In terms of photo quality, I have to say I was not super impressed. For example, I took a selfie in a dark setting with a strong source of light behind me and the contrast was terrible, so I ended up with a blurry photo of a bright white light and dark blob of everything else. There was also some amount of noise and graininess, especially in solid colors, even in well-lit conditions. Thats pretty much what I expected from this cameras sensor, though, as it lacks all the fancy processing of a full on DSLR. Its on par with most smartphones' front facing cameras.

As for the prints themselves, overall, I found the colors to be on the cool side and slightly washed out, resulting in anemic looking skin tones and loss of saturation. Thats not to say the prints were all bad, but certainly not as true to color as I wanted. That said, the color range was decent for such a small printer that doesnt use any ink cartridges, which I think speaks to the quality of the paper. Prints can be fairly expensive though, as the ZINK refills are not cheap. The camera only fits 10 sheets at a time, so youll have to reload the camera after every 10 photos.

For what these prints are, a fun, fast way to share tangible photos on small format instantly, its a neat little gadget that produces decent enough pictures; it has a fairly wide angle lens for group selfies and is small enough to slip in a pocket, purse, or bag. I did like that each print is a sticker, which I think would be appealing to younger folks since you can peel and stick your photos/creations to notebooks, binders, and other surfaces as cute mementos. For use as an everyday camera though, its not great because you cant take photos without paper loaded, meaning youll always end up with at least 1 print of every photo you take, whether you like it or not."^4^May 17, 2019 2:24 PM

MoGJ^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"The Canon Ivy Cliq+ is a fun and easy to use camera that has it all: great look and design, prints instantly, saves photos to a microSD (if inserted), has a selfie mirror frame, a frame you can see through the lens to help capture more accurate shots, and can connect and print from your phone's gallery. The Ivy Cliq+ is different from other competitive instant cameras of big name manufacturers and even a few few photo printers (which you could says is the closest competitor). 

The instant film is easy to put in and prints quickly by either pressing the shutter or connecting your phone via bluetooth through the Canon Mini Print App, where you can edit photos on your gallery through the app and choose to print. You can add frames, insert filters, create collages, and much more. Also, the photo size can be changed between 22 or 23. The flash can be turned off, left on auto, or fill. 

The design of the Ivy Cliq+ is unique and very lightweight. Canon truly made this instant camera look more like a real digital camera, specially with the rechargeable battery. This is what truly distinguishes the Ivy Cliq+ from other instant cameras. I definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking to acquire a new instant camera. The looks + the easiness of the Canon Ivy Cliq+ will make anyone enjoy taking photos and printing from their phones all from one device. As compared to earlier instant cameras, this one can actually store all your snaps in a memory card to keep those instant images forever. 

The biggest caveat for me is that photos can come out a little washed. Details in the photos are still a little noticeable but the quality of the printed photos isn't much to brag about. Because of this, I knocked down a star. Overall though this fun and quirky camera wins me over because of the many features it contains. Should you get one? Try it; go and get one yourself!"^4^Apr 27, 2019 10:10 AM
3Tcubed^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"If you have the need for the immediate gratification of a small (wallet size print) this is for you. But the cost of prints is pretty significant ($0.50 each) and the quality is pretty good. But it's kind of like the dancing bear, you don't judge based on the quality of the bears dance, rather your amazed that the bears trying to dance, and is a bear!

This tiny camera/printer is the dancing bear. Much as we were amazed by the instant prints of Polaroids in the 60's and 70's. This version does not use any smeary chemicals, rather the paper uses tiny crystals that change color when exposed to heat. The camera/printer holds 10 sheets of this special photo paper, which has a peel off adheasive back. Each is 2'x3', and suprisingly not easy to damage.

But this digital camera is unlike most digital cameras you have used (recently), there is no way to review what pictures you've taken on it. It can only store 3 images, unless you add a SD card, in which case the card will store your images. But you really have to look at this camera more as a printer which can take a picture too. The Canon mini print app allows you to print any image on your phone, or to take a new image with your phone, it can also pull images from your FaceBook, Instagram, DropBox, iDrive or Google Photo account. So you can see why the camera is mor of a printer than a Camera. 

But I got it to take to a wedding, I thought it would be a lot of fun to collect photos for the bride and groom, and to pass the camera around for guests to take their own selfies. 

I also think that my grandson might have some fun taking pictures of his own. The camera has a special led illuminator ring for taking selfies, it should prevent red eye. the back of the camara has some texture on it, the front it very smooth. When printing the led on the top provides some entertainment by cycling throught many colors. It takes about 30s before the picture starts printing and another 20 to complete printing. The app can queue several prints while waiting for previous prints to finish, well thought out. The app also allows you to add borders, edit images, add text and 'stamps' to images. It also allows you to save these editied images.

A couple of things I wish they supported, if you plug the camera into your PC with the supplied cable it allows you to charge the camera, but the camera and it's media is not seen by your computer (the documentation says this should work but I could not get it to work, on multiple computers). There is no easy way to tell how much charge the camera has, their is a icon that shows the connection status to your phone, but no charging % charged status information. There is no screw hole to allow you to use the camera with a tripod. The app has a remote camera trigger, I wish it would warn you, your about to take a picture ok? The timer 3/5/10 works much better.

Given the camera weight in at 7oz with paper loaded, its pretty amazing. I'm not sure how often I need a 2'x'3' photo, or how often I'll spend 50c for one, we'll see how much fun it is at a wedding, or other special events. I suspect I'm make a lot of new friends with it, just wish the paper was not so expensive (on price break as you buy more either)."^4^Apr 23, 2019 6:00 PM
Dawntastic1^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^1^"I was initially excited to receive this camera. We have a newer version of a polaroid camera already, that also only has small photos. We got that one about 5 years ago. However, we stopped using it because of the high cost of the film. The Canon - IVY Cliq+ Instant Film Camera also has pretty expensive film, with it costing around .50 cents per photo. So if you're looking to take and/or print a lot of pictures, be ready to drop some $$$. That being said, the app was super easy to use and connect the camera/printer to. I was able to print photos I had saved in my phone, but you can also use several other social media apps. Now on to the quality of the photos... this was also a disappointment. The photo that I took with the camera, was fairly bright and well lit, probably due to the added lighting ring on the front. However, the photos I printed from my phone were very dark in comparison to what the photos look like in my phone. I know that the printer is small, but with the price they're charging for this thing I assumed the pic quality would be a little better. I will say the photos were decently clear with the detail, just washed out and darkened from the original. If they lower the price of not only the camera, but the film, I would say this would be a good gift for a teen, as you can peel and stick the photos to anything you like. But as it stands now, I wont be purchasing more film once we run out. The camera (we got rose gold) is very appealing to look at, and feels sleek, but its more of a novelty, IMHO."^3^May 3, 2019 10:36 AM
ShawnInKB^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"I used to love Polaroid pictures when I was a kid. My dad had a couple over the years and I loved getting the instant print and watching it develop. This Canon camera is cooler, next-century update. The camera itself is pretty and has a simple form factor. Its slim enough to put into a purse, but a little too large to put in a pocket unless your a guy with normal sized pockets. 

Taking a picture is literally one click, then it takes about 30 seconds for the print to come out. The print is cool in that you dont need to use ink - its somehow built into the paper. The paper is about $.50 a sheet so not cheap but not too pricey. there is also an app from Canon that lets you take pictures with your phone and use the camera as a mini-printer. The pictures have a peel off back so you can stick them anywhere as well. The app also lets you add flair, like text bubbles, silly glasses etc. a la Snapchat. Im looking forward to using it at parties and handing out actual pictures to friends - they will love it!"^5^May 2, 2019 7:50 AM
stoptheclocks^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^2^"The Canon IVY Cliq+ combines taking a picture and printing it. Yes, a two in one with the size a little bigger than a credit card. The Canon IVY Cliq+ lets you take your pictures and print anywhere. No need to have to have a separate printer. This does make the Canon IVY Cliq+ a sturdy weight in a small size. A lot of tech is housed in the Cliq+ including easy load Zink film. The Cliq+ is great at selfies and also has a very striking high tech look to it. I had the sapphire blue and it was stunning.
 I first downloaded the Canon mini printer app. This app is very intuitive to what you want to do with the Cliq+ and Bluetooth. While I was downloading the app, I had the Canon IVY Cliq+ charging. It took no time at all to get the electric juice so I could take and print pictures and the Bluetooth connected.
 The film is loaded in the back of the Cliq+ after easily removing a panel. The film of choice is the Canon Zink paper. Zink paper has all the ink you need to print colorful and bright picture on that Zink paper. It is great not having to carry around ink for the pictures.
 2x 3 Zink paper is the only size the Cliq+ will take and is loaded with those dimensions in the back panel. It is great tech to have paper that includes the ink. One important this to note: Put the blue card facing down and the Zink paper facing up. The blue card sets up the printer and cleans it heads. 
 I was able to print 3 pictures before the battery got low. I also took several pictures as a point and shoot camera too. It has a wide angle lens in a 8MP image sensor. I didnt expect the Cliq+ to work so well with just taking pictures, then printing them. The optical viewfinder is clear and prints pretty much what you see. Some of other features on the Cliq+ camera include a built in flash, autofocus, timer, auto exposure making it more than just a printer, it is a great camera as well. Pictures came out clear with great color saturation and sharp definition. And of course the pictures are stickers when you pull off the back!
 One other unique feature is the Cliq+ you can print from your smartphone via Bluetooth from the Canon mini print app. I had several old pictures on my phone for a while that I thought would make a great picture. I was able to print effortlessly from my smartphone to the Canon IVY Cliq+. I posted the picture with the guitars that I printed. It was a bit bright in the room but thought the picture came out well (the picture in real life looks better). The fruit picture was point and click. That picture printed out nice too.
 Bluetooth also allows you to customize your pictures, with borders, symbols, texts and more. This is the kind of fun you can have hanging out with your friends , parties or events. It is great to have these options on such a simple camera. Your smartphone shows what options you have added to a picture and helps you select the picture you want.
 For selfies the Cliq+ has a ring around the lens (8-LED) that enhances the brightness for these kinds of pictures. There is also a 2 selfie mirror on the lens that guides you that makes a real difference in the placement of the picture.
 You can take about 25 pictures on a single charge (stored on a mircoSD card slot on the Cliq+), but I didnt quite take that many. I took about 10 pics and printed 3 of them. Zink paper leaves no finger print and a glossy finish.
 If you need space on your Cliq+ you can insert a microSD card in the provided spot. Save your pictures and then print them later. Another great enhancement for the Canon IVY Cliq+.
 There are only a few buttons on the Canon IVY Cliq+. They tell you when the camera is printing, after a picture is taken and the variety of option in the look of the picture. These are pretty self explanatory but a quick read card in the box gives you information on what to do and how easy the Cliq+ works.
 The only thing that limits the Canon IVY Cliq+ is the battery life. I believe it does pretty well with printing 3 pictures or 25 point and shoot. But it wont take long to accomplish that, so it is always good to charge it from the mini USB to USB cable whenever its handy.
I really am enjoying this Canon IVY Cliq+. It is packed with tons of features and pretty amazing picture quality. The biggest surprise for me was the point and shoot. It surpassed my expectations and the pictures printed out very well. The printer inside the Cliq+ was excellent and quickly printed out pictures. The Canon IVY Cliq+ is a great new Tech product that combines printing, shooting pictures with a variety of options."^5^Apr 23, 2019 2:27 PM
Selva^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"I have been using full frame DSLRs and full frame mirrorless cameras more than a decade now. I never used 'Polaroid' type cameras with instant print. I got the opportunity to use Canon IVY Cliq+ Instant Film Camera. I was surprised by size and design this camera. It is very lightweight with built-in printer. It came with Canon IVY Cliq+ Instant Film Camera, ZINK photo paper pack (10 sheets and one Smart Sheet), Micro-USB Cable, Wrist Strap, warranty sheet and quick start guide. There are multiple color options available with Sapphire Blue, Rose Gold, Ruby Red and Pearl White.

It will take 8MP photo. It has large circular 2' selfie mirror with eight-LED ring light which is great for taking selfies. It has microSD slot which can be used to store photos. 

There is no display and only option is to use optical viewfinder to take photos. I don't see this as an issue as i never use display monitor to take photos in DSLRs. However, without display there is no option to preview the photos. I have taken few photos with the camera and photos came out with the size of 2'x3'. There are only two size options to print either 2x2 or 2x3. The photo quality is not best. But, it should be fine for 2x2 size of print. 

I have installed the app my iPhone and able to control the camera to take pictures using Bluetooth. The nice feature is to print the photos taken from the phone. 

Canon IVY Cliq+ Instant Film Camera is definitely a fun camera and bringing the Polaroid type feature with additional capabilities. Now everyone is using phones to take photos and videos, i am not sure the need of instant film camera with printing option considering the cost of photo paper will be higher to get average print quality. I would rather take the photos either with mirrorless or phone and print it with high quality."^4^Apr 30, 2019 10:57 PM
Jack^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"I have always been interested in the so called polaroid instant-print cameras since childhood. I finally got my hands on the modern version of those magic machines through the Canon IVY Cliq+ Instant Film Camera. The camera is surprisingly light and thin considering it has its own printer inside, thought its wider and taller than some mirrorless cameras I have used. The body is plasticy, but quite sturdy - it fell off my hands to the ground a couple of times and the only damage done was some dirt marks (it was not very hard ground though).

The most important thing about this camera is the simplicity, which is quite polarising. There is NO display - only an optical viewfinder to frame your shot. Theres no way to preview the picture you have taken - the whole thing is (sometimes annoyingly) surprisingly straight-forward. You frame whatever you want to take a picture of, focus, shoot, and the photo pops out in 2x3 sized supposedly water-proof paper. You dont necessarily need a memory card, but still you can get multiple copies of the just-taken photo by pressing a dedicated button. The only other function button (apart from the power and shutter buttons along which a slider for flash settings) is the one which lets you choose the print-out size: 2x2 or 2x3.
The front has a big mirror that lets you take selfies though I havent used it. Theres ring-type lights that helps for that too.
The print quality is quite nice for such a fast and small printer, but outdoor picture looks washed out, with not much details. Indoor pictures are decent. The camera is particularly aimed for taking fun pictures for friends and family, and those pictures look quite good. Its a really good camera to take some pictures when youre having fun at family vacation or some activities.

The added benefit of this camera is the smartphone app. Not only you can remotely control the camera, but also you can use the camera as a printer for your smartphone camera. That is what I have been using it for mostly. Again, dont expect very high quality print, but for the 2-inch sized paper, they are decent.
All is all, Im very happy with using the Ivy Cliq+. The only cons I can think of the lack of previewing photos (even when using the app as remote), the washed out look of landscapes, and finally Canon only bundling 10 photo paper with the camera - they shouldve packed more for the starter kit."^4^Apr 29, 2019 2:08 PM
Shae^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"I already had the expectation that this would of been a good first camera for my 6 year old, if it didn't work for my needs, and I couldn't have been more right. The quality of the prints are not as good as I thought it would've been. I wasn't thinking that it was going to be DSLR quality but I saw a couple reviews for Canons original Ivy, and the prints looked good, real good.

I used the camera, as well as, printed off some photos that I already have on my phone. Each print has a pink cast to it, and the photos aren't as bright as they are on my computer, phone, or larger print. I professionally take, and edit photos, so to see the color not print the same as my photos are, was a bit disappointing. I will say that the sharpness of the photos that I already had, did translate to the final print, I just mainly have an issue with the change of color, tint, and darkened exposure.

Obviously, the camera itself isn't going to deliver sharp photos, but it does take decent photos. I was off on two of the photos with getting three of us in frame. I cut off my daughters head twice. So that will take some getting use to, as it does offer in-frame guides on the selfie mirror part. I didn't notice them until after I had already taken the two pictures. 

I do not like the long 'shutter' button on the top as it is way too sensitive and sometimes when I clicked it, I didn't get any sign that the photo was taken and gave up at that point. I put the camera/printer down and was about to walk away, when all of a sudden it started printing. I didn't know what it was going to print as I had pressed it several times before giving up. Thank goodness it was a good pic or else the paper would have been wasted. Also when I was out of paper, if my finger swiped, not pressed, on the button it began making beeping noises and blinking red. I'm assuming it was to remind me not to press the button, but that would detail how sensitive the button really is. Its also in an awkward place because you tend to grab the printer in that very spot while its on could cause photos you didn't intend to take to be printed.

Ok so the added feature of the selfie mirror on front is great because you can see yourself and so can your friends. Just make sure you're in-between the frame guides. It also has lights, Unfortunately, I ran out of paper before I could test the flash. Sorry. But you are able to adjust the light settings from medium light to full light. since I didn't get to test it, I can't expand on that. 

Let's talk about the paper. Thank goodness they supply a 10 sheet pack in the box, but that was used up so quickly. It is EXPENSIVE. I mean if I let my 6 year old use this as his camera to take epic instant photos of him and his friends, then I am in a heap of financial trouble, because he will blow through those photo papers in no time. The photo paper is also a sticker, so if you want to stick the photos on any surface you can do so. I haven't tested the stickiness of the paper by adhering it to a surface, but I did feel it and yup, it sticks, its not tacky to where it would be incredibly difficult to remove.

Visually, it's cute. But it wouldn't be something I take on any trips with friends to capture instant printable moments. Which is what I was hoping to do. I will however, pass this on to my son and let him have a ball with it. Him and his sister thinks that the IVY Cliq+ is amazing. So if you are shopping for a younger kid, tween, or teen, this may be the perfect gift for them. They would get a gag out of this with their friends. If you are looking to have quality wasted girls or guys night out photos for instant laughs this isn't for you."^3^May 3, 2019 3:16 PM

So let me start off by saying that I was contemplating between the instax mini and the canon ivy cliq plus. But Im glad I went with the canon ivy cliq plus because its just so much more better. 
Pros: 
1). Stick pictures in a scrapbook, refrigerator, on the wall. ( you can peel the back paper off and just stick it on) 
2).  You want to add cute emojis? No worries. ( install the app for the camera on your phone and add text, cute icons, & Press Print!) 
3).  The group picture finally came out nice & you need more than one copy? You got it! Just press the reprint picture button & there you go it! 
4).  No more Duracell batteries!  (Charge it whenever you want to go out, it lasts the whole day)
5). Not confident with how a picture will come out? ( just take it on your phone and print it from there) it works as a mini printer. 
6). So compact, it can be carried anywhere"^5^Nov 12, 2019 9:32 PM

Not as user friendly as I would have liked. Also no image settings, except orientation and print another copy. it's a poor attempt on Canon's part to create a Poloroid.

Young Adults review:

Pros:

- To start off, the good things about this camera is that it is small and can fit in most pockets.

- It also comes in a few colors that would appeal to different people.

- It is a fairly good price for a camera, which makes it more affordable if you dont want anything too expensive.

Cons:
- The instructions are quite vague and there isnt many words.

- I was confused on how to use it, and the app seems to have no correlation to the camera, and I still dont know how to use it, or what the app is even for.

- The view finder may be tuned to a specific distance and so on a close-up shot will not be in view. The viewfinder is the only reference you have because there is no display.

- And lastly, the camera view. When you looked through the view finder, I saw the photo perfectly, but when I took the picture, it only showed the lower left corner, and my photo was ruined, and it was a waste of print paper, too. 

Adult review:

Packaging:
Simple and recyclable 
- The plastic that protects the camera is #6 which I know our transfer station takes.
- Plastic bag is #4 which can also be taken to our transfer center.

Included:
Camera
USB Standard to mini for charging.
Lanyard for carrying. looks sturdy, should work fine.

Single sheet no words instruction icons for Charging, Loading print paper and using mini print with smart phone (Apple or Android). 

QR Code on single sheet instructions that takes you directly to the Play Store or Apple store for the Canon Mini Print application.

MINI PRINT:
The mini print app immediately jumps right to the Instructions for power up, paper load, Bluetooth connection, etc.

Power up:
App says to push power button. It doesn't say that you have to hold the power button until it comes on, buts that's what you have to do. Says the LED will be white and become solid. I observed the LED to be blue and turn a solid pink when powered up.

Load Paper:
Instructions are basically clear in this regard. First how to remove cover and second how to load paper.

---- My Google search for the instructions found the CLIQ+ manual. I had to search the support pages at Canon USA. There is more information available for the CLIQ+ including Specification, Manual, Supplies and accessories (print paper), Download & Drivers (nothing but app stores). The manual is much more complete with 34 pages. I saved the pdf for future reference.

Crash!
My mini print application crashes every time I select the camera icon in the app. I have Android 6.0 and mini print claims to be compatible with 4.4 and later.m

Photo Quality:
The photos we've taken in different settings all look a bit washed out. This is consistent in multiple settings. 

Selfie mirror:
I have to admit that the selfie mirror does help you take a better selfie. This seems to do a better job than a smart phone with a the selfie image. I suspect it is the combination of the mirror with the camera being dead set in the middle of the mirror.

Conclusion:

I'm not sure why anyone with a smart phone today would want to carry another camera just for the print feature. It seems to me that a Bluetooth enabled printer would be more valuable and could focus on print quality."^3^May 17, 2019 11:49 PM
Eivylu^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Excellent product I recommended to everybody, teen will love it"^5^May 17, 2019 6:05 PM
erinb16^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review of the product.

This is an interesting little instant camera. For it being an instant camera, it actually produces decent quality pictures, though the colors in the pictures were sometimes a little off. One thing that I absolutely did not like at first and took a lot of getting used to is that you cannot decide whether or not to print a picture - you take a picture, it prints...in fact I accidentally took a random picture while holding the camera and wasted a piece of photo paper because of it.

To say it is easy to use would be an understatement - I took it to a family gathering Easter weekend, and of course my 8-year-old niece just HAD to try it out, and she did, without any help! I just showed her the camera, told her what does what, and warned her that any picture she takes will be printed, and she had some fun with it! She also really liked that her pictures became stickers (the photo paper that comes with the camera has removable backing that you can take off and stick your pictures on things).

I tried out the photo app as well, which connects via Bluetooth and allows you to print pictures from your phone with the camera. I was hoping the aforementioned picture color issue was just the camera, and it was not - the pictures printed via the app were still a little off in color. Aside from that issue, the app was easy to set up and use!

Overall, would I buy another? Not likely. With the weird coloring and the fact that I consider myself a novice/beginner photographer, this just wouldn't suit me. I would say kids would get the most use out of it, but it is an expensive camera just to let a kid play around with, not to mention the cost of the paper! I will, however, say if you are not a person that is terribly concerned with the color quality and want to have fun at a party or wedding, etc, this might just work for you!"^3^May 9, 2019 10:56 PM
TheHodster^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"If you're like me, you take hundreds of photos with your phone, but rarely print any of them and have a hard time finding the one you want later. The CLIQ+ allows you have an immediate print of your photo and also allows you to transfer them through Bluetooth to your phone, etc. so that you can modify them and/or put them on social media. Printed photo costs are reasonable coming in at around $.50 per picture."^4^May 8, 2019 8:15 PM
KansasMeddlingMom^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"So, the Canon Ivy Cliq+ is a sleek, easily-held in one hand, camera. I got it in the pearl white and it is very pretty. There is not much in the original package-the camera, a wrist strap that needs to be threaded through either one of the top right or left sides, making it comfortable for either the right or left handed user, a 10 pack of the zinc photo paper, the charging cord, and pictorial-type user guide, which is very rudimentary.

Step 1 is to charge the camera, easy. Step 2, put the pack of film in the compartment on the back that has a slide door, blue bar code paper down and the film side up, no problem. Threading the wrist-let strap through its intended area was a feat. You need to press the print button so that it feeds out the blue paper and then connect your mobile device, most likely your smartphone, by Blue tooth to the camera where the Canon mini printer app also needs to be downloaded to. This app is found under M for Mini with a Canon logo across it- dumb me I kept looking in the C's for Canon. At any rate, it got done. No problem connecting camera by Blue tooth, and will, through the app apply all the design to your camera's galley of pictures that it does to the pics taken by this camera. I must admit, that even though I am a 60 year old, playing with all the design features is very fun, nothing is impossible to doctor up.

The bad- getting that wrist let strap through and I am not ham handed either, but someone with good dexterity and fine motor skills.

The ugly- I took several pics, inadvertently printing them, thereby wasting good money on very expensive paper stock. I looked
 up that a 50 count paper stack is $25-WOW! I fear that this cost will take all the fun and novelty away from this device. So, my recommendation is tempered by the fact that the user has full knowledge about the costly expenses involved with this camera. This is a novelty for parties or other special occasions, not the day to day, or even the bulk of pics taken on vacation."^3^May 4, 2019 7:55 PM
EngineerMom^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"If you are looking for an instant print camera that will capture the moment and give you immediate photos, this is it. If you want high quality to your photos, this may not be your camera.

In the box is the camera, a micro-usb cable, a wrist strap and a pack of 2'x3' printer paper (zink). Setup is easy, charge, install app (not required, but provides more features and social media interface options), and ready to go. 

I have another brand camera that also is an insta print, and I can confidently say that the quality is about the same. The Canon may have a slight advantage for clarity and the flash being able to lighten the background. 

The camera is sturdy, with a front mirror around the lens, which helps you make sure your selfie gets everyone in the photo. Just point and shoot, pic prints a dry photo within seconds. 

My only complaint is that the buttons are sensitive and I found myself accidentally taking photos when I picked it up. The tween in my house declared its just me and not an issue. 

Overall a great, on the go, camera for capturing and immediately having photos to share. While this is a camera that I'd use to capture your once in a lifetime vacation memories, it will work perfectly for capturing you, your friends, and your selfie with the random cat."^4^May 4, 2019 12:22 PM
CynicalWoman^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^1^"This little camera/printer is a lot of fun. Its like an old Polaroid as far as instant gratification and fun factor, but better when synced to a phone. On its own, the photos are fine, but phones have such sophisticated cameras now, that this is better for me as a mini printer. And everyone loves the instant reminder of a (well edited) good time."^5^May 3, 2019 3:17 PM

First, this is a small easy to handle and use instant camera. Pics are processed using supplied paper and reorders of the paper are reasonable. The unit has a mirrored surface over the lens for aligning up selfies. Makes it easy to use for that purpose. Pics are delivered a few seconds after snapping the shot. Picture quality is very clear and crisp. Color reproduction leaves a little to be desired and that is the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5. Great fun to have around for parties or family gatherings."^4^May 3, 2019 12:15 PM

Small and easy to carry. 


Great features and connectivity to phone. Ring light, Bluetooth printing from your phone, micro SD card slot You do need to test it out with different lighting conditions to get a good one.


The sticky paper makes them great for placing them on a notebook, scrapbooks, wall, hang them to a lighted string...

This camera would be also fun to use at parties instead of a photo booth. But dont expect DSLR quality, or even phone quality photos though."^4^Apr 30, 2019 9:54 PM

No issues with focus on the camera and the picture quality is pretty good. 
Nitpicks: 
1) a small sheet with diagrams showing how to work the camera. Nothing in detail.
2) refilling the paper is expensive. It basically 50 cents a sheet.

ExcellentEducator^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Do you like striking a pose? Are you the ultimate selfie person? Do you like capturing the simple, quirky and sentimental moments? If your answer is, yes then Canon has a new camera that clicks and prints on the spot! The new Canon Ivy Cliq + is a great little carry around novelty that captures those pictures that one likes to preserve and keep. Canon has truly made this an easy process as no assembly is required, its truly ready to start its job and deliver great pictures. Some pictures I took were pretty decent and a few of them were kind of grainy but truly the good outweighed the bad as this is a quick way to capture those sentimental moments one may have. 

The cost of the paper at approximately .50 cents which can get some what pricey if youre one who loves to take a plethora of pictures. However, if youre the ultimate picture taker, then this very well maybe the camera for you!!"^4^Apr 27, 2019 7:54 PM
Mistabritt^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This is a cool little camera. I've been testing it out for the last few days and its a pretty fun camera. Kinda like the old Polaroid cameras from back in the day (without the shaking of pic after it pops out). Canon has done a great job with this camera. It packs an 8 MP camera and printer all together in a nice colorful package. This camera comes in a variety of colors. This model also features a selfie mirror on the front, for those that must catch that perfect shot of themselves. On the side is a slot for a micro-USB port for charging as well as a micro-SD card slot. The micro-SD slot is great as it allows you to save your photos to a card. To load you simply slide off the back-plate and load the Zink paper as instructed along with the SmartSheet and start snapping away. Something that definitely appeal to the younger crowd is that the photo paper is actually a sticker. So this camera would be great for a teen."^4^Apr 25, 2019 9:01 PM
BillnMish^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Pros:
Compact size (especially considering it is also a printer)

Great build quality

Connects to phone(s) seamlessly with no hiccups

Useful/fun in specific environments (wedding, party, backyard get-together, etc etc etc)

Printer quality - even bad pictures are printed nicely, and nice shots (when/if you can manage one) look REALLY great

Cons:
Button layout - some buttons interfere with hand position while holding the body when going to pick it up or during printing. My wife snapped two photos the first time she picked it up and a third one while trying to move her hand to ready for printing another. There really needs to be a 'lockout' feature or something simple like on electric shavers so that you can't depress the shutter button.

Image/picture quality - photos almost always appear way too dark, straight out of a disposable 1999/2000 era camera

The specific paper is still pricey and you HAVE to have it in order for the camera to work, which is ridiculous IMO. You have a paperweight the moment they decide to stop making this specific paper."^2^Apr 25, 2019 8:32 PM
Ponskippa^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^3^"As a longtime photographer who had his start with film I was initially excited to try the Canon Ivy Cliq+. After all, it does have a very modern and sleek beautiful design. The camera is made of a slick hard plastic. It is quite slippery and besides the textured film cover on the back, there isn't much to grip onto with this camera. I recommend the first thing you do is attach the wrist lanyard that is included with it. The big round mirror in the front acts as a selfie mirror and has framing guidelines etched into it. The white ring around it houses multiple led bulbs for a 'flash' In my opinion, they aren't the brightest and if you use them as a fill light, they tend to wash out the colors in your photos. The camera does not have a screen on the back but it does have an optical viewfinder with a helpful frame also etched into the glass to help frame your shots. You can insert a micro sd memory card into the camera to save the photos you take with it. It is charged by micro usb and canon includes a short cable for you, but no power supply. I was able to charge it up with my phone brick. In my use, The battery held just enough charge to use a 10 pack of 'film' It will need to recharge by the time you are done printing a 10 pack. The 'film' Canon chose to employ for this camera is of the zero ink type, also known as 'Zink' It takes the digital image and transfer it to the paper with heat. The camera has a 8mp sensor , there is no mention on lens specifications. I was a bit disappointed with the picture quality produced by the sensor and lens in this camera. The camera meters exposure just ok, but the colors and contrast aren't consistent. In other words, I would not depend on this camera to save your lasting memories, or the film for that matter. I did go out of my way to purchase a couple packs of Canons Zink paper, and it is better quality than competing brands. The adhesive seems stronger and the paper itself also seems stronger. The 'zink' technology is very cool, but in my opinion the results are poor at this price point. The best thing about this camera is the ability to connect it to your phone via bluetooth and print photos that you may have taken with your phones superior camera, or even a real digital camera that you may already own! The app is easy to use and transfer photos to the printer simply and quickly.I have included two photos i Printed with the ivy cliq, but that were taken with my mirrorless camera. It is hard to recommend this camera to somebody that wants to take photos to cherish lasting memories with because the 'film' is expensive and yields low quality images. This camera is a toy at best, or perhaps for a child whom you want to teach the basics of film and photography too. If you simply must have a hybrid camera / printer that makes stickers out of your photos for you, then perhaps you'll enjoy it."^3^Apr 25, 2019 2:21 PM
ZBMILLER^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The Canon Ivy Cliq+ is a nice concept, back to the poloroid instant print cameras. I really was surprised with the side of the device, most phones nowadays are larger than this!

The camera works well, it took a little adjusting to get used to the framing of shots, there is a little frame to help get your shots, just keep in mind that this is a rectangular shape on the circular lens or selfie mirror on front. The prints photos aren't anything you'd praise, but my kids definitely love capturing photos, being able to stick them onto a surface is a fun little feature of the film.

The Mini Print app is a pretty neat feature also, you can take a photo using your phone, or one you already have saved, and add text, filter or emojis and print them if you choose.

The concept is great, and can easily appeal to the younger crowd. I would definitely recommend if you are looking into instant cameras you check this one out."^4^Apr 24, 2019 5:39 PM
Linksys^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^1^"If you purchase this for novelty or for a young child then I could recommend it. Being able to print your photos and have them as stickers is cool. Scrapbooking, parties or just as a keep sake and I think youll be happy with the photos. The camera isnt bad but isnt great, its really best used in good lighting even when using the flash. My biggest issue with this camera is that there is no way to preview the photo before it prints, even if you use an SD card. Removing the paper and having only the SD card in it, wont allow you to take the photo and save it to the SD card either. I know back in the day you couldnt preview your photo, but when marrying old tech with new, this to me seems like an oversight. The biggest reason, the paper is not cheap, the paper runs about $25 for 50 or $.50 each if its not on sale. You should have been able to turn on/off a preview photo before print feature within the app. Im not sure if Canon can implement this through a software update, but if they can that would be very huge. This one feature alone could save people a lot of wasted paper. When using this to print photos from your phone, you can obviously do this and change things about the photo, why Canon did not at least add the option to do that in the app is beyond me. This may seem like it would be redundant since you could just take it with your phone, but you would at least not waste a lot of paper on bad photos. With that said, if youre mainly going to print photos from your phone, you might as well just buy the printer and save some money. I have and love the Canon ivy printer and was hopeful for this, but not at least having the option to preview your photo before you waste paper is a let down."^3^Apr 23, 2019 9:45 PM
Keirmeister^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^2^"I think a young child would enjoy this Instant Film Camera, but if you're looking for high-quality photos and prints, this device falls short. I had a difficult time getting a good light-dark balance. I think pictures came out much better outside in natural light...but in a darker space inside? Forget it. Also, the prints are noticeably washed out.

Here's what I liked:
* It's a good size for a quick camera that prints out your pics.
* Setup and connectivity (to a phone, if wanted) was pretty simple.
* The selfie lights and mirror are a smart addition.
* Smooth and consistent prints (no lines like on an old inkjet)

But I ran into many problems:
* The image quality isn't great for both the saved image and the print (see sample photo).
* The case has texture with tiny dimples. This is good for gripping, but attracts gunk quickly!
* 2'x3' prints have limited usefulness. How many things can I stick them to?
* Replacement paper is relatively expensive
* Without paper, the whole device is useless

This last point is important: If you run out of paper, the camera will not take any pictures - even if a memory card is present! This is even stated so in the FAQ!

So I wonder who the target customer is for this. Even sending a photo from a much better camera resulted in a washed out print; and if there's any way to adjust this directly on the device, I have seen nothing to document it.

In the end, I think this device is a novelty, or better suited for younger children. If you're getting this for a child, he or she is going to love it!"^2^Apr 23, 2019 9:28 PM

So I thought this might be a fun camera to have since I had a Polaroid instant camera as a child. I have to say I was disappointed though. For the price I was not impressed with the results , the camera is suppose to be 8mp but the quality just isnt there, the pictures look faded when they are printed, the paper is ink less & develops instantly but its expensive & the pictures are only 2x2 or 2x3 with a sticky back. There is a blue sheet that must always be in the paper compartment or the color is even worse. I also printed a picture from my phone that I had taken with my good Canon camera & it was also very faded. The camera itself seems cheap, the paper cover keeps coming off & is very flimsy plastic. Camera can only be charged by usb & the charge didnt last very long . Operation is easy with only power button, flash button which must be in the fill position to activate the led selfie ring. There is a large selfie mirror where the lens is & you must look through the viewfinder to take pictures , there is no screen on the back. You can add stickers & text to pictures through the app where youll also find the complete owners manual. This comes in a lot of colors too, but I believe theres only 3 colors that are Cliq+. Im not into selfies so I would say this would be a great camera for a teen/tween or someone who just wants fun pics without quality. Ill stick to my digital."^3^Apr 23, 2019 8:44 AM

teasten^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^2^"The Canon IVY Cliq+ is an interesting product, something of a hybrid between an instant camera and a photo printer. The Cliq+ has bluetooth so you can install the Canon Mini Print software, iOS version here

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/canon-mini-print/id1335828771?mt=8

the phone software means you don't have to take photos with the IVY Cliq+, but can import and print photos from your phone. This is my preferred approach, as the IVY Cliq+ has no screen and it's hard to get comfortable with the old way of taking photos, printing, and hoping you took a good photo.

The big thing you need to know with the IVY Cliq+ is what is the photo quality like. If you keep in mind, it's printing photos in something about the size of 2 decks of cards side by side, the quality is good. That said, the photos do look very much like the old school polaroid style even though they print borderless and come out ready to view (no need to wave the photo paper about). The photos are small, roughly a little bigger than a business card and are OK for fun prints but not great for keeping forever.

That's the thing about the IVY Cliq+ it feels like a lot of compromises, so it's not a replacement for your phone, or a decent photo printer, or printing photos professionally. It's more a fun camera. We used it over the weekend at a birthday party and everyone enjoyed using it and loved printing photos (and the lens has a great selfie mirror built in). It's just not a camera you would use every day, more something you would pull out for a special occasion.

I think the perfect place to use the IVY Cliq+ is for weddings, graduation, or birthday parties. Putting it somewhere that all guests can pick it up, take a photo and post it on a wall during the day/night would make for a cool and different experience. 10x better than buying and having half a dozen disposable cameras (can you even still by them) and then having to develop film.

In summary, fun, love that you can connect the IVY Cliq+ to use as a photo printer for your phone, just don't expect it to print great photos."^3^Apr 23, 2019 8:55 AM
ladilyn^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"I was really looking forward to seeing what this camera/printer could do. I'm disappointed. First, there is no explanation of features. Unless you can figure it out yourself, you wouldn't know that you can use a microSD card to save photos. There's no indication of where you can buy more photo paper either or whether there is photo paper available for it that isn't sticker type paper. It's as if they've made this only for people who are knowledgable about technology, not the 80 year old grandmother who wants an upgrade from her old Polaroid camera. Then again, that same grandma probably doesn't care about saving the photos but also wouldn't know how to go on-line to order the paper. This has the same problem of the Polaroid in that you cannot preview before printing so there's a good chance you've wasted a picture and the paper isn't cheap. If you want to preview the pictures before printing, use your phone then print.

Regardless of the above, there is some good. First, it is a much better picture than the Polaroid and you don't have those awful chemicals to deal with. Loading the paper into the camera is easy. It's a good camera for parties so you can send home something fun with the kids to remember the day by. Also, have your child hold up your cell phone number, take the picture and stick that on them in case you get separated. I can think of a number of uses for it particularly for those who have younger children or perhaps people playing party games. Having the sticky back may make it a good option for those who do scrapbooking.

Overall, if you are looking to print photos, a regular photo printer would work just as well. If you are looking to upgrade your old Polaroid, this is definitely a consideration. As far as recommendation, that's a tough one. It would definitely depend on who was asking as for some, this would work well while for others, not so much."^3^Apr 30, 2019 9:51 AM
RunningMan^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"Although these days your mobile phone is your everyday camera. Hauling this camera around would be for the sole purpose of having instant photos, which is most likely not a majority of occasions, but that is for each individual to determine. Let's start with the good. The Canon IVY CLIQ Plus camera is portable, should fit into pockets and purses with no problem. The camera has a quality feel to it as some, unlike some other instant cameras I have seen that are bulky and all plastic. The quality of the photos are decent in terms of instant photography. The technology behind the Zink (Zero Ink) paper is pretty amazing. Your choice of 2'3' or 2'2' photos come prints out in less than a min for instant sharing of photos. The mobile app adds additional functionality such as adding effects and stickers to the photos as well as giving you the option of printing photos off your mobile device, effectively make this a portable photo printer as well. The generous sized mirror in front around the lens making selfie captures a breeze. Here are some of the complaints I have with this camera. There is no LCD to review photos. This would probably increase the cost of the camera, but what this means is that you are truly back in time with 'you get what you get'. There are no options to print what photos you want, all photos taken with the camera will print immediately. At around $0.50 per print, it would be nice to control your prints as this could add up which is why is why I say it is not an everyday camera. 
Because of not being able to toggle between photos, the 'reprint' option is only good for the last photo taken. Also disappointed that there is no zoom what so ever. You are pretty much locked in to your 2 size print options. The camera services its purpose for instant photos, it is missing some flexibility that people would want to have in order to want to carry it around with them more often."^3^Apr 29, 2019 1:24 PM
BillK^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"This camera is attempting to provide an option for people that want to print pictures right away and not have to wait for a printer. It's an interesting throwback to the Instamatic days but unclear why this would be needed now. The came is pretty well built but the picture quality on the paper is marginal. Having to purchase the print paper over time is an additional cost as well. If you need to print pictures on the spot, this is a good option, For everything else, it may not be worth your time."^3^Apr 24, 2019 3:42 PM
Tweed^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-pearl-white/6344861?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"Despite this camera being a Canon, it seems pretty cheap in quality. Unboxing was simple, just the camera, wrist strap, charging cable, and a pack of film. I've used the Fuji version and the new Polaroid. It does print the photo out quickly, and the film has a sticky back to be able to stick the photos on stuff. There is a mirror on the front to be able to take a selfie which is a really cool idea. I wasn't pleased with the quality of the picture when I did a few selfies. It looked kind of grainy."^3^Apr 24, 2019 2:10 PM

It is very difficult to view anything underwater on any small camera, so you kind of point it and hope.  I did get used to viewing the screen through my goggles and could at least make out a large rocks or a shell I would aim for with lots of fish or coral near it.  I could then zoom, focus and shoot.  I am a semi professional photographer but not underwater.  The quality of the photo when taken in highest quality and largest size, though the camera over processes like all point and shoots, when edited to clear haze and shrunk to a 2500px longest side was great and hid most over processing artifacts created by the camera. It did a colour reproduction in and out of water but it is not my professional DSLR.  For the money it was awesome.  Fun and easy to use.  I quickly learned the set up and appreciated being able to adjust the white balance and have jpg's with a high enough quality and size to edit. I snorkeled two days for 4 hours each day, had the camera under water the full time and 0 issues, it worked flawlessly and much better than the throw away i would normally use.  It will pay for itself in 4 snorkeling days.  Attaching photos, they have been edited to remove haze and to my liking.  The wonderful thing about the camera is i can take photos, throw away those that don't work without paying to develop them and keep what i want, and edit them to my liking, unlike the film throw aways."^4^Nov 4, 2019 9:03 AM

I didnt want the weight of my larger underwater camera added to my luggage while traveling.
First thing I noticed is this camera eats up battery power if you leave the Bluetooth feature turned on (which allows you to sync the photos to you phone or tablet via the app which is way cool IMO). It takes good pictures, in fact my snorkeling pictures are better than my diving ones. It also take good pictures on land. All in all, I would recommend this camera for its small size, ease of use and quality of photos. Just be sure to get extra batteries and a charger."^4^Jun 8, 2019 7:29 AM

Tabi^/canon-powershot-sx730-hs-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5847201?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^40^8^"I am still trying to decide if this purchase was entirely worth it or not...

Let me first start by saying I am using this camera more so for video rather than pictures. I have another camera (DSLR) I use for photography but it is too bulky to really use for easy video recording. So, this review will focus on its recording capabilities...

First, the quality of the footage recorded and the options are good. Are they they best? Prolly not but for the price, the quality is great! So, that is a plus.

Second, the battery....SUCKS! You can really only get roughly about 45mins to a little over an hour recording time with the battery. The crappy thing about this is, you cannot plug this sucker in! Even though it has a port to plug into a power adapter, all the camera allows you to do when it is plugged in to a power source is look through previously recorded or taken pictures. It will NOT allow you to use it to record or take pictures with. Its like the camera's programming just turns into safe-mode or something. It is weird and annoying! With that being said, if you are planning on using this camera for long-term/all-day video taking, go find yourself a bunch of batteries and charge those suckers up!

Third, if there is not a lot of movement in front of the lens, the camera turns off after about 25-30mins. I was trying to make a time-lapse video and there was minimal movement in front of the camera...but it was still movement that I wanted recorded for the duration of the project. After 25mins it basically did a quick 'inactivity' type of pop-up on the view screen and proceeded to turn off. I thought at first it was a fluke...no, this happens every time I try to capture similar videos. I just turns off...so if you are using this to video capture things such as you painting, building something, or anything that requires you to pop it on a tripod and record a scene...expect the camera to randomly turn off after about the 25min mark. Maybe there is a setting I am missing? Maybe there is something in the options I accidentally clicked? Not sure...but it is annoying and this is probably one of the biggest reasons why I kind of regret purchasing this camera. It is also the major factor that is giving this product a low star review.

Fourth...SD Card memory. I usually use a large SD card so that is not an issue when it comes to space. However, even when recording on high quality (the highest is can go), this lil sucker does not waste space. It is good at conserving space on SD cards...at least from what I can tell.

I think that is about it...it is not a bad purchase but because of the random shut-offs and short battery life (without the ability to power it through a power source/adapter) I do regret buying this. However, if you are looking at this camera for photography or small video captures...this might be the camera for you."^2^Jun 2, 2018 3:18 AM
Ace27^/canon-powershot-sx730-hs-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5847201?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^25^0^"First lets remember what this is, Point and Shoot. I've read a lot of reviews knocking the camera without really knowing how to use. I've been a canon User for about 15 years from Full frame all the way down to this. I bought this specifically for travel or when i am hanging out with the kids . Here are my pros and cons after using it in many places. 
Pros: 
super zoom its amazing . (works best with a Monopod or Tripod)
Colors are beautiful if you have a good light source. ( I wouldnt say its great in low light but it does ok , it's a small sensor)

Video quality is amazing hands down. Yes no 4K , but its 1080p at 60FPS 

Face detection is pretty good , better in video honestly

Cons: 
avararage battery depletion at around 240 photos (at least for me )

You can not manually focus with focus points (my opinion not really a deal breaker)

This one hurts me : no RAW only JPG, I suggest take your time if you really taking an important picture to avoid grain or color distortion.

no Audio Jack (unless you can do it Via usb somehow , that i dont know about) 

Overall I am pleased with the camera. Can it be better, absolutely. Its takes better quality image than a Cell phone. if you are a true photographer you will notice the difference. This is for the consumer that like to VLOG, travel light to take quick snapshots. I will show pictures of a Yankee game where i zoomed in all the way sitting on Left field. images are straight out of camera with no editing whats so ever. I think the pictures can speak for themselves , i think they are very decent quality for memorable moments."^4^Aug 15, 2018 1:46 PM

The good zoom range and high megapixels make for much better photos than my phone's camera. After about a month using it I've been real happy with the results.

Rocket62^/canon-powershot-sx730-hs-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5847201?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^12^0^"I can't recall the number of cameras I reviewed and how I was really wanting a larger type removable lens... This has 40x and 160x digital zoom. Like me, you may recall some of the older cameras with digital zoom that simply pixelated the image. This is nothing even remotely like it. I tried it out at the store and was impressed with the clarity and detail of the zoom. 

After purchasing I found it even easier to use in the 'Manual' mode. Say what? Yes, you can easily dial the shutter speed, F stop, ISO and it shows you on the screen what the photo will look like at that setting. No more taking a few shots, look, adjust settings, repeat until you get the settings just right the picture you want. Before you press the button to take - you know what it will look like. 

The moon shots are now so easy to take, but for the long digital zoom you will need a tripod or something to stabilize the camera, but well worth it. 

I uploaded a few images. 1. The close-up of the moon is around 140x digital and the other in the 60-70x range. 

Lots to learn, but I love this camera and highly recommend it.

The only thing it needs is a remote trigger. Perhaps it has that and I haven't read up enough on it. Otherwise, I have been setting the photo to delay taking for two seconds to ensure no movement of the camera on the tripod."^5^Mar 14, 2019 8:11 PM

GeoffK^/canon-powershot-sx730-hs-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5847201?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^0^"Overall this camera does what it should and it takes pictures in a somewhat compact form factor. It has the settings you would want from a point and shoot, and some extra settings for those who like to tweak their settings a bit. Essentially, it is a Canon point and shoot as you would expect it to be, and I certainly expected it to be as it was going to be my 4th Canon in the last 10 years.

Unfortunately, this camera was just underwhelming picture after picture. I bought this camera right before a trip to the Colorado mountains, excited to get some great pictures of snow and wildlife. Everything looked great on the tiny display, and it seemed like everything would be just as great as I expected it to be once I transferred them to my computer. It was not.

The colors were dull, the pictures were grainy even with a minimal amount of zoom applied, and ultimately it was a poor showing. Thinking maybe it was just a settings issue, I went out and tried some more picture with different settings. Still just as dull and underwhelming. This $450 point and shoot was no better than a $200 knock off, at best.

I returned it and went against every bone in my body and bought a Sony. Not that Sony isn't also a great brand, but I have never been a fan of their camera either point and shoot, or SLR. Instantly the pictures from the Sony were easily 10x better. Colors were bright and vibrant both on the camera and on the computer. Zoom wasn't distorting pictures like you had taken it with a smart phone. The point and shoot I expected from the Canon, was here in my hands without a Canon name.

I think they simply missed the mark with this version, and hopefully when I check them out again next year they will have fixed whatever issues they may have had here."^3^May 3, 2018 5:25 PM

We purchased this camera for a trip to Colorado. The camera was on the expensive side for a point and shoot. We used the camera while hiking and the camera was somewhat bulk y and heavy in the pocket. The camera was almost as big as the chassis of my SLR with out the lens attached. Most of the images were good to great but had several that were not completely in focus. I found that when using the 40X zoom, you need a tripod or something to stabilize the camera, otherwise the picture was always blurry. The other issue is that the lens protector (the one that opens and closes when you turn the camera on/off) would stick halfway when turning the camera on. Have several pictures where the lens was obstructed by this. I ultimately returned the camera. Overall, I was disappointed in the camera - expected more from Canon and more for the price."^3^Aug 17, 2018 5:18 PM

Unfortunately, I accidently dropped my Samsung camera and the lens was bent and unable to move back into the casing. So, one of Best Buys representatives highly recommended the Canon Power Shot and said it was superior to the Samsung I had. Not true! First, the canon does not have a touch screen, the colors viewed in the picture are not true to what the naked eye sees or when printed, it's slow at focusing on objects and it is very particular about close ups and often snaps pictures very fuzzy. You also have to be super still to take a picture and don't breathe to get a half way non-fuzzy picture. Most of the pictures I've recently taken are slightly fuzzy and they were not moving objects. So, for a basic camera, it's 'OK' but all the bells and whistles listed are poor compared to the hefty price tag, I would not have purchased it if I had known what I was REALLY getting. So, I'm going to try and get my Samsung fixed. Not happy about my Canon Power Shot purchase at all!"^2^Nov 9, 2018 3:57 PM

My wife and I were going to be out of country for several weeks and wanted to be able to take pictures, but also be on the go the whole trip. I ditched my large body camera and picked this one up. Absolutely wonderful decision! 

The image quality is excellent, the low-light capability good, size & ergonomics excellent, video quality excellent and that zoom! Wow! The zoom makes this camera a must-buy for me. 

It also has the option of plugging in a microphone, making this a really decent option for recording live events. 

With the retracting lens its pretty compact and not overly heavy. There are smaller/lighter cameras out there, but none with this amount of optical zoom and features.

The one ding to this camera is the flip-up screen. I've been spoiled by Canon's articulating screens. This one ONLY flips up, not out or down. So if you want to hold the camera above your head to get a picture of the stage, you can't look up at the screen. Or if you want to hold the camera flush up against something and flip the screen to the side, you can't. It only flips up -- great for low shots or selfies, but not much else."^4^Mar 22, 2018 10:14 AM

The continuos shooting puts the pictures in sets and it's a pain to go in each set to erased the bad/blurry ones. The single shooting takes way to long to use it in sports mode. Wish the zoom button was in a different place because I can zoom in and then take a picture. Also the screen tilts to the top, wish it tilts to the side and then I can twist it to the front, top or bottom like the EOS Rebel T6 or T7."^3^Mar 9, 2018 3:27 PM

dranreb^/canon-powershot-elph360-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4866801?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^28^2^"This camera is small and lightweight. It easily fits in a pants pocket or purse (even a very small purse). I was very happy with how easy it was to carry around and use when traveling. I wish it came with a case though. The large, bright screen makes it easy to compose pictures. Anyone familiar with the Canon Rebel series would find the menus on this camera similar and easy to use. The camera gives you a lot of control in manual settings, but I also found the AUTO mode to be quite effective for most of my needs. I am very impressed with the photo quality, especially the accuracy of colors, like a blue sky. (I have seen other cameras 'wash out' a blue sky but not this camera.) The camera also does an excellent job in scenes with high contrast. The photos come out great and require little or no editing. Battery life is excellent and I like that the charger does not have a cord. One less cord to drag around. The charger's prongs fold up, too, so it is very portable.

One minor complaint is that I wish the lens had a wider angle in order to take more impressive landscape photos. Another complaint, which causes me to knock one star off the rating, is that the wifi is very clunky. It requires you to download an app onto your computer and sign up for a Canon image service. I would have expected to only need to download an app. Not create some kind of account. The wifi is a useless feature to me and I am happy to continue putting the SD card into my computer or printer slot.

Overall this was a great purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very portable little camera that has a good zoom and takes great pictures. It is good for travel because it does a great job in a variety of shots, whether you are taking landscape photos, close-ups, or photos of people. I brought this camera along on a trip where I also used my iPhone 6s for some pictures. The Canon ELPH 360 took better pictures, hands-down."^4^Feb 28, 2018 9:08 PM

I've owned a few ELPH cameras through the years and this one is as great as the others! Good features for a $210 point-and-shoot camera. Smartphone cameras are catching up in quality BUT Point-and-Shoot cameras are still better because they have a physical zoom lens. 
This camera has great photo quality, burst mode at about 7 shots a second, good low-light images, decent battery life(Make sure you have at least 2 spare batteries if you're going to be taking photos all day. And it's small and slim which it will easily fit in a pocket or in a small case with spare batteries attached to a belt loop.
Overall, a great compact camera. I definitely recommend the ELPH 360 HS over the ELPH 180 or 190 BECAUSE of the HS system, image stabilization(Especially when recording video) It's definitely worth the extra $40 or so. Canon has definitely dominated this market for years and will likely continue to do so for years to come."^5^Nov 22, 2016 12:19 AM

It does lack a true manual mode, however (allowing the user to set shutter speed and aperture manually). The control buttons on the back are flush with the case, making the camera somewhat difficult to use in very dim light conditions. As with all point-and-shoot cameras that have no viewfinder, the display will be hard to see in direct sunlight. It has a lens cover that opens and closes automatically, which prevents losing a separate lens cap. The camera has connectors on the right side for USB AV out and HDMI interfaces, but they are covered by a cheap plastic cover that is difficult to get open until you file off the catches a little bit. The Li-Ion battery is small (only 800 mAh), and I have not yet determined exactly how long it will last (the manual claims 180 pix). I have only used the USB port to transfer pictures directly to my computer without going through an online service. I have not tried setting up the Wi-Fi interface yet to see if it would be easier to use. This camera has both High Speed Burst mode (about 7.2 pix per second) that will group the pictures and Continuous Shooting Drive Mode, which allows pictures to be taken continuously while the shutter button is held depressed (about 2.5 pix per second; pictures are NOT grouped)."^5^Jul 31, 2018 4:43 PM

If you're use to using PowerShot then the User Interface is about the same thing. Design choices come down to compromises. I would have preferred a screen that tilts up but I like getting so much picture taking power in something smaller than my hand with a good image stabilizer capability. I really like being able to carry this little guy around my neck or tucked into a little gadget bag on the bike.

I downloaded the required software and then spent about 3 hours trying to get the Camera connected to my computer. I then went on-line and downloaded the 157 page used guide but the chapter for connecting to a computer was for Windows 7 users. Canon customer service told me that the Camera worked perfectly on windows 7 but there are problems with windows 10. They blamed the problem on windows 10 but their camera was 'perfect'. The person asked me to make a number of changes (adjustments) to my computer so that the camera could upload pictures. I had no idea what I was doing but I was told that my adjustments would not hurt my computer or prevent any other software from operating correctly. The Camera still didn't work after about an hour of discussions and making computer changes. I was told that I could use a USB cable but I could still use Wi-Fi. I was told that sometimes it takes about 50 or more tries to connect the camera to a computer that uses windows 10. Each try takes about 5 minutes. Forget it. I returned the Camera on February 18th.

I question Canon's comment that the Camera works perfectly on windows 7 - you can't even purchase a computer that uses windows 7. Why does Cannon continue to sell this?

The interior photos are a bit grainy and the lens constantly picks up dust orbs more than any other camera I have used. Doesn't take good pics in low light and I have to sometimes press the shutter button several times to even get it to take the pictures. It will not take a picture no matter what the setting in an attic because of the low light. I was standing in an attic for awhile trying to get the camera to take the picture and it wouldn't. I finally had to use my phone to get the picture. This is the first time I have ever used a Cannon and will go back to Sony.

It was a debate between purchasing another Nikon or give Canon a try. So glad that I chose this Canon ELPH 360.

I read several of the reviews that were posted on this site and was able to obtain enough information to make my final decision.
Prior to purchasing I visited a Best Buy store to get a true feel for this product. 

I used my new Canon for a trip to Disney World in Orlando. It's super easy to use(just point & shoot) and takes great photos. I ordered the purple color and the color is exactly as pictured.

So you can't move the photos onto your computer with a USB cord. You have to use wifi to do it wirelessly with the faulty, unreliable Canon software to get your photos off of this camera. And you need to register with Canon and fumble through a clumsy installation process before you can do that. That also requires that you have wifi available to you when you want to do the transfer - not just to install the software but also every time you move photos from your camera to a computer. I guess many people don't care, but that can be problematic depending on where you're traveling, and at home I'm wondering if it adds to data consumption. And the software for transferring the photos doesn't even work right, so I'll probably end up pulling out the SD card and using a card reader instead to transfer the photos. This is frustrating because the camera otherwise is pretty good. It's friendly to use, with the necessary features. It's a decent cheap point-and-shoot. I just really don't like this nonsense about not having a port to plug a cable into. That's a deal breaker, the way I see it. I can't imagine how many pennies they shaved off the price by leaving off such a basic component."^2^Jan 8, 2018 4:28 PM

I brought it to my 'welcome baby shower' so I could have guests take photos and add them immediately into a baby book along with a bit of writing. Since we could take and print the photos on the same device, it was much more convenient than having to collect photos from everyone's phone to print later. The paper it prints on is also sticky backed, so I didn't need to worry about bringing glue or tape to add the photos to the book. Everyone was so in love with my baby and the Sprocket 2-in-1, I had to keep a close eye on both of them! ;) 

I have also used it at other parties, and even let my sister take it to her middle school dance. It was a hit, and she loved being able to take 'old fashioned' photos with her friends all night. They all had their photo stickers on their binders the next day. 

Overall, it is a GREAT product, and I love having the app to be able to crop, edit, and add fun stickers to the pictures before printing. The camera quality isn't quite as good as your phone, but it is perfect for on the go or for kids and teens. You can also print photos from your phone gallery if you want a higher quality print.

I had high hopes for it, based on the regular Sprocket Photo Printer that we already own. They perform the same, in that you can print photos directly from your phone via the HP app. The photos are of passable quality and have a peel-off sticky back, which my girls love. 

The 2-in-1 goes one step further, allowing you to take photos directly with the camera/printer. I wish that HP had taken the time to develop it a little more thoroughly. The viewfinder is a bit awkward to use, and I've heard that it often gets stuck in the open position from others.

I like that you can peel off the back of the photo in order to use the photo as a sticker somewhere.

When looking through the view finder, it didn't quite line up well with the photos, so that is why I rated it a 4. With a little practice, I think I'd get the hang of how to aim it correctly. The photo I have attached shows how I thought I had it aimed right and it ended up off center.

I do recommend that you go outside and take your pics, or better yet, upload them from your social media or phone camera.

Jbravo70^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-vi-21-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6259643?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^36^8^"Ok, i have had the Sony RX100II for quite some time. One of the top reasons why I loved it was because its compactness & it took the most gorgeous pictures when bouncing the flash. The pictures would come out rich with colors and the flash although very tiny would make the pictures look like you were using a very expensive good flash. Also, it had the multifunction hotshoe which I could also attach an external mic for better audio. 
So fast forward, I see the new camera mark VI come out and with an impressive lens range of 200mm. I was excited! I bought the markVI and began taking pictures. When I started to download the pictures I noticed that they werent really different from my markIIs in sunlight. So I started taking pictures inside bouncing the flash. The pictures To my surprise didnt pop like the markii. So I began taking pictures with both cameras same settings, same positions. The MarkII pictures are so much better by a lot! Even changing every setting in the markVI did nothing to compare it to the markii. I dont know if its just the flash, the new lens, software...but it doesnt take better pics than the markII. Sorry to say it went back. The new features are totally awesome and Im sure the video is better, but the pictures sucked compared to the markii. I dont know what Sony did, but they messed up big time. I really wanted this camera to take the great pictures like the markii but it doesnt. The new features are awesome, especially the 200mm range and the selfie feature, but if the pictures arent better I cant keep it. Im not going to gripe about the price because this camera is in a class of its own for being so compact. My brother has a markV which I intend to compare to mine. But until then Im saving my money for the upcoming Sony A7000 or Baby A9. Im just going to keep my markII cause it takes awesome pics. Hope this helps guys."^3^Oct 27, 2018 12:45 AM

I already own RX100M4, so I was already familiar with the camera operation. I bought the M6 because of the longer reach of the lens. While the M4 is good in low light, it is limited in telephoto reach: 70mm vs. 200mm. The M6 is very quick to turn on and shoot. With the improved pop-up viewfinder, I can turn on camera, click viewfinder tab, and be ready to shoot in 3-4 seconds or less. The M6 also has very fast focus as well, so I can find and focus on a subject quickly, even flying birds. My intent in purchasing the M6 was as a travel camera. I am traveling to Europe late this summer, and I am looking forward to using it there. So, in summary, I have been testing the M6 for about two weeks in preparation for my trip. We will see how it performs, but in view of my tests so far, I think it will work very well."^5^Jul 27, 2018 10:48 PM

All previous cameras have been good but I always felt that they lacked the zoom range to make them perfect travel companion. RX100 VI fixes this short coming with 24-200 mm zoom range. 
Though due to longer zoom the lens is not as fast as the previous version so if you shoot a lot in low light previous version will be better but for an all-in-one travel solution RX100 VI is my recommendation.

NOTanseladams^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-vi-21-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6259643?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This was the most expensive point and shoot camera available, so it took some soul searching and research before I decided to buy it.  I have no regrets.  I had been a dedicated DSLR user even on vacations, but several professional photographers told me convincingly not to be a slave to a big heavy DSLR while on vacation.  Even mirrorless cameras were too big and beyond my needs.  Technology has advanced where a point and shoot camera can deliver spectacular results and slip in your pocket when not in use.
Why not just use a smart phone camera?  Several reasons.  The image sensor on the sony is about 3x larger by area.  Larger = sharper.  The flash is far better than a smart phone.  But the most important reason is the zoom.  The sony goes from 24-200 and this is all optical. Zooming is essential for creativity and flexibility.  Doing selfies with this camera is also far better than with a smart phone.
After a week in Amsterdam and Brussels, this camera did not disappoint.  I wore shorts and dedicated a pocket for the camera with nothing else in the pocket to potentially scratch it.  I would pull it out, shoot and put back.  Using this method, turning on and off constantly, which advances and retracts the lens each time, only yielded about 150 shots per battery charge, however I was also viewing them during the day, which uses battery.  There is no build in location tagging but you can do it if you turn on the blue tooth and sync it to your phone but I'm sure that will use more battery.  Having an extra battery was important.  Bestbuy had a bonus with purchase of camera with an extra battery, camera grip and SD card.  I opted to buy the separate battery charger since opening the little flap on the camera and plugging the cable into it was a pain.  
I did not post photos since Bestbuy only allows images to 5mb so the photos would not give you a true sense of the resolution quality.

Cwhiz^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^204^10^"I've been a long time Nikon shooter owning four Nikon cameras. Currently I have a D700, D7000, D70, D40, a Fuji X100s, a Panasonic Lumix LX3 and a Sony camcorder. I was happily surprised as I was not expecting what I discovered with this new camera.

First, the menus are a bit simple for me as I'm used to the extensive controls on my other Nikons. It does give you a lot of range to work with though and I like the user presets. I love the articulating screen and the nice solid feel of the camera in my hands. I haven't used all the features yet, but am downloading the full manual to get to them (it comes with a 'starter edition' instruction book which is very basic#.

The features of the continuous high speed captures were amazing. This camera takes pictures before you fully press the shutter, then captures up to 20 for you to pick the best shot as well as a BSS #best shot selector# selection. It captures all very fast and I use a San Disk Extreme card with it. You can turn off shutter noise too!

The manual settings, are easy to work with the two wheels, making the adjustments easily with nice firm movement. All the shooting modes #EV+/-, macro, flash and ISO# are easy to get to and use as well as the other settings in the menus. The zoom function has many stop points to set for quick use and a pre-set zoom feature.It has a convenient function button to use for a favorite feature for which I use for a quick change to high speed shooting selections.

Now for the Zoom function which blew me away altogether! After a few test shots, I saw the pics were fairly sharp with the great built in stabilization working, although my hands are not as steady as they once were. I took some license plate shots over a hundred plus yards away and these were as clear as if I was ten feet away! I went in for a shot of a pool ladder in a back yard five houses away #see pic I uploaded here#. When I zoomed in on the pic on the monitor I was in disbelief #as was everyone I showed it to# as I was able to read the impressed warning label in full detail. I was barely able to see the ladder from where I was standing at first.

I tested it at a beach nearby the next day and got some beautifully rendered seascapes, sunsets and close-ups of a bridge almost three miles away that I could make out the antennas on it. I could see from the slight fuzziness of these long shots that to really get the great shots, you'd need to use a tripod with the stabilization feature turned off and possibly a remote control or the built in shutter timer which would remove most of the unsteady hand held movement the camera has to deal with. I do this with my other Nikons as well to insure the clearest shots.

The Wi-Fi is a great feature that hasn't been tried yet as I wouldn't use this camera for a photo shoot anyway. It's one of my 'fun' cameras and I'm really enjoying what it can do, especially the great 'on-the-fly' bird shots I've been able to capture so far as well as a few airplanes flying over. Will give it a good run this summer when the landscape is full of things to shoot.

I'm very happy with it and am looking to accessorize it with filters and such. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants the best Nikon has to offer in a very long zoom at a great price to be sure considering what's in it!"^5^Apr 7, 2015 6:52 PM
SafariAhoy^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^164^11^"Deciding on this camera: We bought this camera to take on safari. We have been using point-and-shoot cameras with smaller zooms (15X and 25X) for travel, but we wanted to make sure the animals we saw were not just little dots in the pictures when we return from the Serengeti. We looked into purchasing a DSLR; however, to get a similar zoom plus the camera body seemed like it was going to cost over $1K. The most informative review on the P900 was at Photography Life (https://photographylife.com/reviews/nikon-coolpix-p900) by John Sherman. He highlights the features, at times in comparison to his expensive professional DSLR, and includes many sample photographs. Sure some quality is lost in the picture of the eagle at full zoom; however, the camera that took the crisp, clear photo cost him over $21K! For many people, lack of RAW format was a disappointment; however, my version of editing is using Google's Picasa to sort through (and occasionally crop) the 100s (or 1000s) of photos I take with the point and shoot. Thus, JPEG format is fine for us.

Purchasing: Finding the P900 in stock was a challenge, but we were able to get one from Best Buy following the advice in one of the Amazon reviews that suggested checking the stock on the Nikon webpage each day. Basically, there is an option on the P900 Nikon page to 'Where to Buy' that actually lists the online suppliers and whether they have the camera in stock. I looked everyday for about a week in mid-June, and one morning it was listed as 'In Stock' at Best Buy. I bought the camera and then looked back at the 'Where to Buy' on the Nikon page, and it said out-of-stock again.

First impressions: The camera case is a lightweight plastic that some reviewers thought looked/felt cheap. However, carrying the camera around at the Botanica Gardens in the heat, I was very appreciative of how much less the camera would weigh than if it were made of metal or heavier plastic. I was able to hold onto the camera with one hand via the grip with the strap wrapped around my wrist for a little extra security for the hour we were out without tiring. I used my left hand to stablize the camera whenever using the zoom or when I was not in direct sunlight.

Using the super zoom: When I first tested the camera indoors or in the shade with the zoom fully extended, it was difficult to get a non-shaky picture. However, when we went to a local nature reserve, I was able to get pictures of birds we only spotted with our 10X42 binoculars at full zoom with the camera supported only by my two hands (not even bracing my elbows against my chest as I did in the shade pictures). There is enough detail to see that the birds eyelids are open in one picture and closed in the next. I used the 'bird watching mode' under Scenes, which takes up to 7 pictures (in 1 sec) when you press the button. This increased the odds of getting a good picture of the bird, but had the downside of waiting a few seconds after each burst of pictures for the pictures to write to the SD card (16 MP picture quality, 90MB/s memory card). The camera has this great function when the zoom is extended and you lose the bird you are trying to shoot called 'snapback zoom'. With your left hand you hold down the button on the side of the lens and the camera will zoom out. A black box appears in the view finder, move the camera to get the bird in the box and then release the button to zoom in on the bird. This is super efficient and less nauseating than trying to search for the bird at full zoom.

Continuous shooting mode: We had great fun photographing animals that stayed primarily in the same place. However, we will need more practice to be able to catch a flying bird. The continuous shooting mode at max rate is 7 frames per second but it stops after the 7th frame and starts writing to the card. The pre-shooting cache is partial way around this. You press the shutter release half-way down, and it starts taking pictures. When the animal does something interesting, you press the shutter release the rest of the way down and the camera saves the previous 5 pictures and then 10 more. I was trying to use these functions to take pictures of my nephew going down a circular slide at the park. He got frustrated when I asked him to go again and again. I was only catching him appearing around the first loop. In retrospect, what I really needed was to use 2 fps (one of the slower continuous modes) so I could keep taking pictures until he reached the bottom. 7 fps was just too many pictures for the slide action.

Battery Life: I bought 2 Watson brand batteries as they were $40 each at B&H photo, instead of $80 for an extra Nikon battery. Then at Best Buy a few weeks later, I saw their generic brand on sale for $10 per battery (normally $30) and bought 3. The P900 uses the same camera battery as the P600. They tend to last about half-a-day depending on how much I use the view finder vs the screen. The other issue is that if you are trying to track animals to photograph, this also eats up battery so the picture estimate that others have given (~260 photos) may be much less (if you have to wait sometime for your shot) or twice that if you use continuous shoot. We shot ~600 photos of birds (7fps, 1 sec at a time) over a ~2 hour period at a bird reserve last weekend.

Automatic vs Manual Modes: On my previous point-and-shoot camera, I had relied on the 'intelligent auto' function. For the P900, the automatic button (green) takes reasonable pictures but you can make very few adjustments. Under SCENE mode on the dial, there is an auto scene selector as the first option that works more like the 'intelligent auto' on other cameras. There are many great scenes to choose from including the bird watching. To use some of the great features such as 'Active D-lighting' to bring objects out of the shadows, however, we have had to take a crash course in manual settings for photography (using many free web resources). This overall has been very rewarding, and we are now primarily using aperture mode for everyday shooting with the camera. Note that for the manual mode, there is an option under setup to have the screen reflect the exposure level before the photo is taken. This is good for reducing the number of too dark photos.

Other cool features: The camera has a time lapse mode for taking pictures of cityscapes, sunsets or night skies. We have tried the 50 minute series for sunsets twice now with great results. It takes several pictures a minute and then quickly compresses it into a 9 second movie."^5^Jul 22, 2015 4:27 AM

It has a great zoom with a fast focus. People that see my bird pictures think that they were taken with a DSLR because of the detail and sharpness. The p900 is a big step change from the previous 2 models. I rarely write reviews but wanted to tell people that this is a great camera for taking bird pictures.

KayH^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^26^2^"I have had many cameras through the years and shoot with both dslrs and point and shoots. I'm not a professional photographer, just an enthusiast.

The P900 is not a small camera. It's about the size of a dslr, though it feels much lighter to me. I can carry it around my neck for extended periods and not find it a strain. When carrying my dslr my neck and upper back always get tired and sore.

I currently have a dslr and a 150-600mm lens, which I use to shoot wildlife and birds. It's big and its heavy, and it's just too much to carry around while hiking or taking walks 'just in case' a deer or a fox crosses my path. I had purchased a small Sony HX50V with a 30x zoom to fill that niche, as a 'grab and go' camera for hiking and whatever might come up, but I soon found that I sorely missed having an eye viewfinder to look through. On bright sunny days I can't see what I'm shooting.

I just recently purchased the Nikon P900 to give me a great zoom, with an eye viewfinder, and still be light enough to carry around with me. I knew going into it that a small sensor zoom camera can not deliver the kind of image quality I get with my Canon 70D & Tamron 150-600 lens. That said, my Canon 70D & Tamron 150-600mm lens can not come close to zooming in to 2000mm. So the Nikon P900 can photograph things that the Canon & Tamron lens can't even see, and not break my back when I carry it.

The Nikon P900 is not a camera for 'pixel peepers'. If you like to zoom in to full size on your computer and inspect your images, you will not like what you see at full size. Detail is smeared, especially on shots at 2000mm. But, if you are content to look at a photo at a size that just fills your computer screen, you may find you are very pleased with the shots from the P900.

I took the P900 to a family reunion the other day, and didn't really plan to take many photos with it. I took a Sony A6000 mirrorless camera and a 60mm lens to use as my priimary camera that day, but I found that I just couldn't put the P900 down, because it was so versatile. A cousin was shooting with a Canon Mk5 and 135mm L lens, and at one point he was having to walk backward further and further and further to try to frame a shot that I was able to just zoom out easily to get with the P900. When someone pointed out an adorable 'kids eating ice cream cones' photo opp, I sat where I was and zoomed in across the lawn and easily captured it without getting up. When I got home, I was pleasantly surprised with the photos I had captured. Photos taken at a closer range are much better and have much better detail than those shot at the full 2000mm.

Would I recommend the Nikon P900? If you are willing to compromise on image quality to have amazing zoom range and versatility, then YES,YES, YES. But if you want National Geographic quality photos, this is not the camera for you.

I would strongly recommend doing some internet research on Flickr or other websites to get a good sampling of what the Nikon P900 (or any camera you are considering) can do. Check out real world samples taken by real world people, and see if the images you see are up to your standards.

For me, I'm a happy camper. I still have my big, heavy, cumbersome Dslr and 150-600 lens when the situation demands it. But for everyday grab and go fun, I'm thrilled with the Nikon P900."^4^Jul 11, 2016 1:38 PM

I feel the user menu is a bit simplified more than need. Sometimes when zooming the autofocus has trouble locking on to your subject if there are other objects between you and your subject, This can be a bit annoying when photography birds and wildlife.

*** Pros: ***
Great reach: 
See the photos I took and keep in mind that I was nowhere near these creatures. Getting close would cause them to run or fly away so having a super zoom is really helpful. Also works like a macro lens without having scaring off subjects by trying to get too close to them.

Decent images:
Yes the images and videos could be better but the good thing is they can be cleaned up pretty good in editors like Lightroom.

Price:
This is the cheapest camera I own and for the image/video quality, amount of zoom you get it's well worth having.

Stabilization:
It has optical stabilization that works pretty darn good. All the images I took were hand held.

Continous Shooting:
Up to 7fps at 16mp. I just figured out it has this. I wish I would have known when trying to capture the hummingbird photos.

Manual Focus:
There is no focus ring but it does have a focusing slider with peeking and it works pretty.


*** Cons ***
Only takes jpg:
I wish it shot raw photos because the jpgs are way over saturated but can be corrected a bit in an image editor like Lightroom. 

Preview:
I don't always shoot in burst mode but having to preview each image after shooting can cause you to lose a shot . I wish I could turn on the image preview.

No Touch Screen:
It would be nice if it had a touch screen at least for hitting focus points.

No Mic Input:
I really don't like not having an option for an external mic.

No Hot Shoe:
It has a pop up flash but when the lens sticks out you get a shadow. Plus it would be nice to be able to add an accessory like a light or a mic... oh wait, there is no mic input.

Overall this is no pro camera but what it is, is a really fun camera for getting shots you would normally not be able to get. The image quality is decent as long as you do a little cleanup in an editor like Lightroom. I almost returned this camera but after having some time with it I decided to keep it. It's long zoom and decent image quality makes it unique to my small of cameras and makes it useful."^4^Sep 24, 2016 12:21 PM

familyof4^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^11^0^"While I spend an above average time in the outdoors (fishing, hunting, hiking, and biking), Im definitely not a hard-core bird watcher. However, after being buzzed a number of times a few years back, while out turkey hunting (with my kids perhaps enjoying this spectacle a bit too much at my expense), I became very interested in learning more about the birds of prey in our area, an in being able to identify them. This inspired me recently to look into getting a new point & shoot camera. By now I had given away a 35mm SLR (before digital days), and an inexpensive digital p&s (in early digital days), and favoring the convenience of my iPhone camera. 

After doing several weeks of research a few months back, I quickly moved up the chain of less expensive p&s choices and landed on the Canon SX60HS. Nearly all of the reviews that I read picked this camera over other offerings including Nikons P610 and the P900. However, a couple reviews got me to at least think about these two Nikon models. (Note: at the time the P610 was not easy to find and was scheduled to be replace by the B700.)

Before making a final decision I wanted to feel and touch these cameras, so I located a nearby Best Buy that had the SX60HS in stock and a few other cameras included in the reviews I read. One of the other cameras was the P900. I picked up the SX60HS first, and fiddled with it for several minutes in the store. Then I picked up the P900. I was immediately impressed with its feel and ease of focusing in particular compared to the SX60HS. While the reviews had me convinced before coming into the store that I was here to purchase the SX60HS, I found myself unable to deny the difference in feel and ease I was experiencing hands-on at that moment with the P900. I spent the next hour or so going back and forth with these two cameras there in the store, fiddling with the controls, settings, focusing on things near and far, as my wife and the salesperson patiently allowed me to compare these two cameras. 

Before purchasing the P900 I asked the Best Buy salesperson if I could bring it back if I wasnt happy with it. He reminded me of the return policy they offer saying, we want you to be happy with your purchase too. Since then, Ive never once thought about returning this camera. Yes, it is a bigger camera than I ever thought Id buy for my desired use in the outdoors. However, after trying it out first at our local zoo, and using it now several times out in the field, I have absolutely no regrets that I went with the P900. Im truly thrilled by its zooming capability, which I can only describe as insane (unbelievable). Its feel and handling, the simplicity of accessing and using its essential basic features, and the ease of focusing continue to impress me every time I use it. And I look forward as well to learning about its advanced features now and growing into using this camera to more of its full potential."^5^Oct 19, 2016 1:56 PM
Junior^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^14^3^"I purchased this camera for it's high power optical zoom. The optical zoom is great but the digital zoom is not worth using. Has great video stabilization, even when taking photos or videos when zoomed in on high optical. It is best though to use a tripod when zoomed all the way to 83X or near 83X.
Only problem I've noticed with it yet is comparing it with my Canon PowerShot SX60 the Nikon Coolpix P900 has very dark pictures and videos when set to 'Auto Mode'. The Canon SX60 is much brighter. For instance when taking pictures in the woods, the trees trunks are black, with the Nikon P900, and you cannot even tell there is bark on the trees. With my Canon SX60 the bark stands out really bright.
Overall, the P900 is a great camera for the price. I don't want to run down the quality of the pictures and videos because I only paid $599 for it and I won't compare it with a $2,000 or $3,000 camera. You get what you pay for and I wanted it for the super zoom.
One final remark....I hear so many people complain about it being so heavy. My thought to that is, if you want to complain about the weight then buy a lighter one and give up the high zoom.
I am very happy with my purchase!
Would have given it a 5 star if the pictures were brighter in 'Auto Mode'"^4^Feb 21, 2016 6:51 PM

Photos are very good. The zoom reaches an unbelievable distance and still holds together well with good clarity. I use the camera for work and have to shoot in a wide variety of situations, low light, distance, macro etc and often in very constricted time frames and on the move. The P900 is snappy and responsive. Very fast startup to shooting time and the menus are fairly easy to navigate. It's quite a bit larger than the P510 and bulky on the supplied neck strap. I solved this by grabbing a Black Rapid Metro light shoulder sling and an OP/TECH D-SLR Digital D Series Soft Pouch (get their spring loaded Fast Cap lens cover too...).

Dubcup^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^1^"I travel to Yellowstone every year and take 2000-4000 pictures. Due to the distance of wildlife in Yellowstone, a zoom camera is a must for safety of people and the animals. While this camera can not get the clarity of a dslr, it does a wonderful job for the price point. Of course low light shots are difficult as with all bridge cameras but there is nothing on the market that can beat this zoom. I have owned Canon SX 30, SX40x, and SX50. I went to Best Buy to get the SX60 and the Nikon P900 to compare them. There is truly no comparison for reach. The P900 wins in all categories. The only minor exception is that the P900 does not shoot in raw for those that like to edit their photos and I believe Canon has slightly better coloring when using auto focus. This camera is a bit more tricky than a Canon. I knew each time with the Canon I would get the shot. This camera tends to blur at times. This is probably due to having little practice before my trip. I did find a nice book on Amazon that explains what this camera can do and not do. I am excited to dig in and learn all of its capabilities. If you are a bridge camera user that does not want to jump up to the price point of a DSLR- this is a must have camera.

One of the drawbacks to the DSLR is having to change Lens for different applications, not to mention the cost of these Lens. The P900 is a very versatile camera. It can take Macro shots l and has a telephoto capability of 2000mm. In other words you can take great pictures of the Moon as well as close up pictures of flowers, portraits etc. It has a lot of functions that a DSLR has for about half the cost.

When you get to the digital range of 8000mm the image tends to 'float' and is hard to get centered at times. Past 2000mm it does get a little soft but most long range lenses do. ...even with the dslr $10,000 600mm giants. So some tweaking might need to be done. Color and egornomics are awesome especially from a long time Canon and Sony user. It is a big camera for a bridge camera. Almost the size of some dslr bodies.

CMCM^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^9^2^"This camera is a lot of fun, and you will be happy with it as long as you understand its shortcomings and limitations. As I read somewhere, this is a really fantastic 2000mm super zoom lens attached to a modest camera. The lens can be very good when you are shooting under the right conditions, and that means you need sufficient light, particularly at the longer end of the range. It's not a fast lens so it's really not that great in low light so choose your photo time accordingly. The vibration reduction is quite amazing, and you can actually shoot the moon, birds, and animals while hand holding the camera. The reach of this 2000mm lens continues to astonish me. I read that to get a separate lens of this reach for a dSLR you would pay $10K to 20K!! Another positive is that the P900 is surprisingly light in weight and very well balanced when holding it. It is better to use a tripod or monopod when if you can, especially at full zoom, your photos will be better. However, with practice your ability to hand hold the camera (with the great VR) will improve over time. I did much better with moon shots when using a monopod with a tilt head (it was harder with a tripod because at full zoom, the moon tends to move out of the lens range quite quickly and you have to re-adjust the lens position often. But it was much easier with adjustment on one plane instead all directions with a ball head, and the one leg of the monopod makes turning other directions much quicker and easier). The necessarily smaller sensor and 12 MP can lead to noise (yes, this is a noisy camera), and noise is more noticeable under less than optimal lighting situations. It's what it is. But the tilt and swivel back screen is great, the menus are easy, it's a fairly quick and easy camera to learn. It can also do amazing macro shots of insects and other small things, even more so when paired with a Raynox 150 or 250 magnifier lens (cheap). Above all, just be informed and realistic and don't expect the P900 to do everything like a more expensive camera with a larger sensor and higher MP. You will get very good pictures and sometimes you'll get great photos if you learn how to use all the camera settings, and this crazy long lens is an enormous amount of fun for certain things. I would not have this as my only camera, but it's a great second camera. Just know what you are buying and what its capabilities are. Alexander S. White wrote a great book that explains everything and how to use this camera...it's much better than the manual."^4^Jan 5, 2018 10:42 PM

Rainbird^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I am going to tell you what is not great about the P900 as what is great about this camera is being said in the many reviews. I use the P900 extensively and can speak about what is not great about this camera with some authority. I gave the camera 5 stars because for what it is, which is a camera that allows those of us who can't afford $20,000++ rigs for wildlife photography, it deserves five stars.
Having said that, it does have it's short comings. The auto focus is only middle of the road. It does not miss focus a lot, but it It will miss focus enough to be irritating in certain circumstances and there is no true manual focus. A good auto focus would be best. When shooting in continuous/burst mode there is significant buffering time between bursts, like 3 to 5 seconds. That buffering time is seriously annoying when shooting birds for example. There are times when you will miss the shots due to the buffering. The image quality is ok/good, but 16 megapixels is disappointing. Is 20 to much to ask? How about 25, 25 would be nice. The electronic view finder is just ok. Functional, but not great. The overall build quality of the camera is juuust good enough. . So far it is holding up reasonably well to the extensive use I give it, but I don't think it was designed for it. I had to send it to a Nikon repair facility for a new integrated circuit board because I was zooming in and out so much I wore out the switch. The new board, as expected, is showing signs of the same wear. I hope Nikon reads this because this camera could be much better."^5^Jan 26, 2018 6:16 PM

I couldn't find what I needed in my price range. The Nikon Coolpix P900 is a great compromise! This convenient camera takes sharp photos both close up & far away, and it actually focuses on a tiny hummingbird instead of always wanting to focus on the background. It is heavier than I am used to, but certainly not as cumbersome as an SLR with 2 lenses. Be aware that you will probably want to buy a separate battery charger because the camera doesn't come with one & requires charging the batteries in the camera.

This camera has been a hot seller and difficult to get but Best Buy finally offered it for sale and I was lucky to get it. The P900's size is akin to a small dSLR but lighter in weight. The zoom range is incredible and the images are essentially sharp. It has wi-fi, NFC and GPS which you can record where the picture was taken. The articulating screen is a nice feature and the controls are easy to manipulate. I do recommend a memory card that can write fast otherwise if you shoot in rapid mode the camera will lag and will miss shots in the meantime. The sensor suffers in low light situations which hunts or ending up with a blurred focus in the end but you do have the option of manual focusing using the zoom lever in the lens barrel (option under setting). Plan to get extra battery because it only takes around 360 images and less if you do use your articulating screen a lot which does zap power. I will be using this camera while on vacation and hiking where I can take pictures of subjects far away. It's also a great camera to use looking for rock climbers in steep cliffs where you don't have a binoculars."^4^Nov 6, 2015 10:25 PM

ByronW^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I got this after an acquintance told me he took a picture with his P900 of the moon during the daytime and could see the clearly see the moon's craters in the photo - hand holding the camera. I bought it and duplicated the moon pic at a 4th of July barbeque. I was amazed and so were the people at the bbque. It was at the beach and I then took a picture of a schooner that was about a mile out from the beach. In that pic we could see the people on the deck and an advert sign for the schooner. It is great for portraits because you can be so far away from people they can't imagine you are taking a full head shot of them from 50 feet away. I do wish it had a better macro mode, but the lens isn't ideal for close-up macro flower pics. Also the manual focus is a bit difficult to use, but I'm pleased with the camera."^4^Aug 30, 2018 1:41 PM

Venice^/nikon-coolpix-p900-16-0-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4961288?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I bought this camera to replace a Canon SX60 that had gone everywhere with me for the last several years and had finally gotten to the point it was becoming unreliable. I was hoping that Canon would have come out with a newer model so when I found that they had not, I looked to Nikon to see what they had to offer. As you can probably tell, I am a Canon person so it took a bit for me to move forward in ordering this camera. But I love it! The longer lens and the smaller F-stop were definitely a plus as I use this camera not only for wildlife photography here at home but it is my go-to camera for traveling. My biggest concern was the ability to hold the camera still enough to take those distant photos as I struggled with that issue when using my SX60. But the longer lens on this Nikon allows me to hold the camera lens in my left hand while shooting photos with my right. This tends to give me more stability and less shake. The camera also has a built in stabilizer which seems to work fairly well. I continue to use my DSLR when I want something a little more professional, but you can't beat this camera for the everyday, carry in your car, candids of the kids and grandkids at ballgames or concerts and travel - it can't be beat!"^5^Feb 16, 2018 6:02 PM

I purchased this camera to be able to take photos of nature from far away (further than my 200mm lens) but could not believe how poor the quality was. 
The macro pictures did come out pretty clear, but even those were not sharp quality.
I have since returned the camera and purchased the Sony Cybershot DSC-HX400V and I am extremely pleased with that purchase. The pictures are SHARP. I am guessing the difference in the megapixels was the problem, even though I had read that the difference between 16 and 20 megapixels was not noticeable.

I had waited until after the holidays to ship it for evaluation (which ended up costing $60 dollars to ship to Nikon via FedEX packing and insurance).

LowerEastSider^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-red/5298700?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^57^3^"I looked at much more expensive cameras but settled on this one because it generally had good reviews and was just small enough to fit into a pocket.

I did not want to spend a lot of money on something that could get damaged, dropped or stolen.

The picture quality is above average without a lot of graininess or artifacts. Even when zoomed-in to a reasonable level on a large screen monitor, most photos look very detailed. And, the colors are quite pleasing and natural looking.

It is best at taking still photos. That being said, when I set the camera in burst mode, I was able to get some decent shots at a recent bike race. But there are better cameras with faster lenses if you plan on taking a lot of action shots.

The 'P' mode offers some controls for things like exposure level and white balance. But this is a camera designed primarily for automatic use. There is no function dial, so you must go into the menus to make changes to the settings.

The camera does a better than average job of taking good photos using the auto mode. And, even in the program mode, it still operates mostly automatically.

The 25X zoom range is certainly more than adequate for most users.

This is not one of those cameras that amazes you with it's shot to shot speed. But for most people it is more than adequate.

You will not feel like you have a 'brick' in your pocket or purse with this camera. It is quite lightweight and not too long or wide. The next most expensive Cannon model offers better performance, but it is (in my opinion) simply too large and heavy to tuck in a pocket.

I bought a small canvas case that I hook to my belt. This keeps the camera protected and it is always ready for use.

This camera is a good value for someone who is not a 'camera person' but wants pleasing, lifelike photos. You could spend additional money and get more features, but not necessarily better quality photos."^4^Jul 2, 2018 7:26 PM

BattyFoto^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-red/5298700?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^26^8^"First let me say this. This camera is nice and good for this price range, which is why it has 4 stars and I would recommend it....
 If you can get past the following points...
**Please note though, the whole purpose of this purchase was for a higher megapixel camera that could give me crisp macro (close up) photos of my artwork. 

That being said, here's my opinion:
1. This camera is tiny! Think almost flip phone size, which makes it very awkward and hard to grip right with average adult hands.
2. Very impressive zoom photos. I used it to take exterior detail photos for an insurance claim. When I took 2nd floor photos of the details around windows, you would have thought they were first floor! So it did what I needed it to there.
3. No cords come with it. You take the battery out to charge it using a plug in adapter. 
4. I ended up not being able to get it to connect to my laptop at all, so I just took the memory card out each time. This was a let down.
5. Cannon menus are a bit confusing to me. My son has a T5, which I tried to use a few times before and couldn't get the hang of things. Beginners be careful and really read the manual and try how to videos online.
6. There's a clicking noise it makes. It's the small metal pieces making up the lense protector. So when it's closed/off, for some reason mine made noises when I moved it around. Just an annoyance.
7. Okay here's the main reason I took it back. The closer shots were not as impressive as I expected per the many reviews saying it's good for that. I'm sure it's better than average though. However, in my case, I need really detailed photos of my artwork to be able to make prints of good quality. This did not deliver. Now, I might have been expecting way too much for a $200 range camera, but I was just going by other's opinions.

It I s a little larger than a 'normal' point and shoot but smaller than the SX 50 which this is replacing. It takes nice video clips. The one drawback is you need to pop up the flash ( not automatic) when needed."^4^Oct 21, 2016 7:39 PM
TexasFlyer^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-red/5298700?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^2^"I'm glad I bought it but it has a few issues. The battery did not last very long and stopped charging after one charge. It told me it wasn't a real Canon battery. That was problematic because I bought it just prior to going on vacation to have a better camera than my IPhone 7. I found two aftermarket batteries and a car charger on the road and they worked so well, I really only needed one. It is a much better camera, than the IPhone 7, but my biggest disappointment was my inability to get decent photos of the stars and moon in the desert sky. I tried every setting for hours and hours. Vibrant is a little too 'vibrant' It will take a woman's face from 'discreet' to saloon hooker. LOL. The Zoom feature was the best part. For my taste, it has a few too many artsy settings to throw fairy dust on your photo but I guess to each his own. I guess the sad part is that I will probably need to run all my vacation photos--- (600) through a photo app or software before I post them. But they are good photos to start with. But my wife just bout an IPhone 8 and it takes a better standard picture than this camera if you don't need zoom and 20mp density photos. The other nice thing is that adding another 600 photos to my IPhone might start giving me memory issues, at least with cloud back up. So I am glad I bought it, but will use it for the zoom feature in the outdoors mostly."^4^Nov 25, 2017 4:25 AM

I didn't read the manual before using it on a recent vacation, yet it was user friendly for taking basic photos. 

The battery is a chargeable battery. It doesn't come charged out of the box, so be prepared to have time to charge it. (I learned the hard way - I took it on vacation still in the box.) Also, it is a USB charger. I tried to use it via my cell phone wall adapter, but it didn't work. I had to charge it via my laptop. 

One difference is my old one had view finder to look through and a screen - this one only has a screen. I keep forgetting - annoying! Another difference is the pop-up flash.

This was very handy in Italy for taking distant photos of details at the Vatican and other locations. Don't buy this for indoor sporting events as the max aperture doesn't allow a high enough shutter speed.

The best price and features for this type of camera, it has a 1/2.3' sensor, which is standard for cameras around this price, it records in HD which is a plus, I think the way the flash works on this camera is very convenient, if you want flash then you pop out the flash with a button on the side of the camera, you don't have to click on the menu, scroll down, select flash, etc etc. It is very easy to use, the only complaint I have is that the screen is a little blurry to me, the specs say that it is a High Resolution screen but it is not, it looks high resolution when the pictures are reviewed on the camera but not while focusing, so it is a bit misleading.

To power the camera up, you have to try and push the little power button on top. I had to use my finger nail to push the recessed button down.

They eliminated the auto flash like the older model had. So if you are taking pictures and the sensors decide you need a flash, you leave your shot, twist the camera sideways to find the little slide button then you raise the flash by using your fingernail to push the tiny little recessed button on the left side.to pop the flash up. Then you go back to your shot.

The other buttons on the screen side are close together and recessed. You have to be right on to push them or you will push the wrong one. The dial around the Func set button is small and when you attempt to push on the outside ring, there's a good chance you will also hit the func set button that you didn't want to push. There are 4 buttons around that dial that are also recessed and close together. Not easy to use.

The door on the right side which you open to get to the HDMI cable hook ups is held by two little plastic strips which I have a feeling would not last that long.

Well, this camera does not. I ordered one on Amazon for $5. How am I suppose to transfer photos if I am at someone's home or a location when wifi or removing the memory card is not an option? You will need the cable. 
The free memory card is to small to be practical. The SanDisk Extreme PRO 128GB SDXC is not stocked at the BB store. Available for half the price at Amazon. That is the best card for this camera. (the micro card is to slow). BB would not give credit toward a better memory card. The free card is a wasted product.
Finally, no storage or travel case. 
So, after you buy this camera you need a transfer cable, better memory card and travel/purse case. I would not give this as a gift because it is not a complete package. More a fault of Canon than BB. What's next? Charging extra for a battery charger? 
I don't like the pop-up flash. That is obsolescence engineered into the camera.

I was careful with it and carried the camera in a padded carring case too. I plan to return it to Best Buy after I return home from my vacation. JUNK! 
 The photos from my iPhone are just as good or better and phone/camera is easier to use."^2^Nov 4, 2017 4:37 PM

I had zero intentions of keeping this camera but had buy something because I use my camera daily for work. This is the next model up from the one being sent off so I had high hopes. The battery/memory card door I'm not really a fan of bc it takes longer to open and pretty much requires 2 hands. My current camera (being sent off) requires one hand to open. The zoom is the biggest issue I have. It is extremely slow to zoom. Super annoying. Oh! And they changed the battery up...gotta love that."^3^Sep 1, 2017 5:23 PM

And I'm here to tell you why you should skip this particular Product from Fujifilm. I do want to state that this is just my opinion but take it with a grain of salt. Firstly, I just want to say that out of the box there were no issues I was actually impressed with the build quality. But the minute I turned on the camera I was immensely disappointed..the LCD not great and when taking a picture you have to wait a couple seconds snapping it because if you move ever so slightly it will come out blurry. But that isn't the biggest issue its the screen itself and it reminds me of a old samsung phone or something from a 90's toy. I loved the Product but for 160 price point I was expecting the screen to be of higher quality. But guess you cant have everything you want in a Product. Lastly the Prints come out way darker than what its showing on the camera now this is just a preference of mine but i prefer my prints to come out more exposed because the Liplay just wasnt giving me that no matter how high you turn the exposure up. And the flash is no help either. I think if you want a Fuji product that gives you that instant photo vibe I'd opt for the mini 9 or if you just want printer with fun tools I'd opt for the mini link. Overall disappointed in this product from Fuji. Will be returning."^2^Nov 25, 2019 11:32 PM

BenYoung^/nikon-coolpix-w300-16-0-megapixel-waterproof-digital-camera-orange/5891004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^19^0^"First of all I want to say that I have been a constant user of Nikon products, I had the Nikon AW130 which was with me constantly diving, hiking and being exposed to the elements. Probably one of the best cameras I have ever owned. 
Unfortunately, the new W300 is not on the same level as that camera. I purchased it and set it all up in m y house before a diving trip. Full battery and new sim card, it was not opened again in humidity or on the boat. The seal was properly shut. I know how to care and use this product from my use of the older version, so this is not my first time with their waterproof cameras. 
On the second dive I got a warning message saying 'battery overheating camera turning off'. As well as this condensation was inside the screen (remember here I had not opened this camera since sealing it at home). As per the instructions (and as I had done countless times with my AW130 with condensation), I left turned off in a dry area with the seal open for 2 days. Needless to say the camera no longer turned on and I had photos from 1 dive when I was completing 24 that week. I wish I had taken my old camera with me but, as I was so used to that one being indestructible, I thought Nikon would have taken the same care with the new version. Obviously not. 
The problems do not stop here however. I have submitted multiple questions to Nikon support about my problem, and I get the same response every single time 'any shock damage or water damage is not covered by the warranty'. I then respond that I am not happy with the answer to this question and, without fail, every time it is marked as resolved when it clearly is not. I refuse to accept this as my fault for water damage and, as I have seen, a number of other people have had the same problem with the new version when owning the old version before it with no problems (thus they know how to care for it). 
If I had messed up and caused the camera to flood I would accept the cost to repair it. As I see literally no way that this was my fault (checking seal before each use etc etc.), Nikon has been consistently wasting my time and not providing adequate answers to questions when asked. 

I would not be disappointed with the camera if Nikon accepted fault and had it checked out. On the other hand, they are skirting questions and not being helpful at all. 

I would honestly recommend different underwater cameras even if there is a slight reduction in the performance. It is not worth the hassle, stress and sheer disregard by Nikon to one of there customers. I would not wish the time I have spent on my worst enemy trying to sort this out., it has been horrible."^1^Oct 8, 2018 8:31 PM

TheDuke^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^51^7^"Instant print cameras have been around since the Polaroid Corporation introduced the Land Camera Model 95 back in 1948. And while it may seem like instant print photos are a gimmick that fell out of fashion with the invention of digital photography, printable photos have become big business once again (as it is a way for camera & film companies to ensure consistent revenue in a similar way to how they once sold film).

The Canon Ivy Cliq uses Zink paper which requires no ink. (Zink actually stands for Zero Ink.) Instead, the photo paper is comprised of multiple heat sensitive layers containing dye crystals that display various colors when they melt. The camera delivers varying intensities of heat which quickly results in a colorful picture. It is important to note that while many companies (such as HP, Polaroid, Lifeprint, Fujifilm, & Canon) offer Zink cameras  all Zink paper is made by one company: Zink Holdings. They created the underlying technology  which has been licensed out to several companies. So, while physical cameras or printers may vary in quality, all of the photo paper is essentially the same.

Just how good is Canons Ivy Cliq?
Well, the Ivy Cliq is Canons least expensive Zink camera coming in at just $99.99. And while it is affordable  it is basically a toy. It is large, made from bright colorful plastic, weighs practically nothing, has very limited features, and prints 5 megapixel images onto stickers. It works just well enough to be passable.

It feels as though Cannon focused too heavily on creating a flashy new device that looks fun and lost sight of actually making a good camera. Where they really fall flat is their halfhearted attempt to make the Cliq a digital camera. The device can accept a Micro SD memory card - and when one is inserted, it saves the picture as a digital file. But, what is absurd is that a digital picture is only saved if there is Zink paper in the camera. If you are out of Zink paper (or simply dont want to print the picture) the camera will not save the digital file. So  dont expect to use the Cliq as a digital camera. If you want a picture, you have to pay Canon for Zink Paper. 
- Having a Micro SD card inserted also allows you to re-print the last photo that was taken  But, even this has a caveat. If you power off the camera, it is no longer able to re-print the last image (even though it is saved on the memory card). This is also frustrating as the device could have had the ability to work as a photo printer  if it could print pictures saved to the memory card. This could have led to more money for canon (as it would require customers to purchase more Zink paper), but it would have interfered with leading customers to purchase the Canon Ivy Mini Photo Printer (which is also $99.99).

There is a workaround to using the Cliq as a digital camera:
If you would like to save a digital image to a Micro SD card, but do not want to print a photo (or are out of paper)  you have two options:
1) Each package of Zink photo paper comes with a blue card that ejects before pictures are printed. You can load this blue card into the camera and take a picture. The photo will save as a digital file and the blue paper will eject as though a photo is being printed.
2) Re-use a Zink Photo Sheet. You can re-use the Zink photo sheets (although I wouldnt recommend doing this too many times with a single sheet). If you load a photo that has already been taken, the camera will print a new photo right over top of the previous image, but the new picture will be saved as a new digital file. 
NOTE: Both of these options work, but it is annoying having to wait 55 seconds for each picture to print and save before you can take a new picture. It is also annoying that there is no screen on the camera.

I do appreciate is that Canon has kept both the camera and the picture refills affordable. Each 2 x 3 inch photo sticker is just 50 cents  which matches the price of virtually all other Zink camera brands. Sadly, buying larger quantities of refills does not save any money.
Though the picture cost is reasonable, it is frustrating that money is wasted on accidental pictures. The shutter button offers almost no tactile feedback and it is extremely easy to press accidentally. Almost every person who has used my Cliq has inadvertently pressed the button while holding the camera (which is frustrating as it wastes money and 10% of the cameras picture capacity).

Here are some other things customers should know:
- The camera does not have any way of indicating how many pictures you have left. Luckily the Zink paper is not sensitive to light  so, if you want to know how many pictures you have left  simply open the back and count the remaining sticker sheets.
- There is a rechargeable battery, but again  no way to determine just how much power you have left.
- The Cliq does have a flash, but it cannot be triggered manually and it only turns itself on in very dark conditions. The flash results in better pictures than most other lighting conditions, so it may as well be on all the time.
- The front features a tiny convex selfie mirror. It is laughably small, but it actually works. What you can see in the reflection, does end up in the photo.

While the Ivy Cliq is fun, I would only recommend it for kids. Instead, I would recommend the Canon Ivy Mini Photo Printer. It is the same price and allows you to print better quality photos taken from your phone. And, because it prints phone pictures  you can actually choose pictures you like and edit them to your liking before you print.

NOTE: The Ivy Cliq+ is 8 megapixels and has a much improved flash. But, it does cost $159.99. I would still recommend the Canon Ivy Mini Photo Printer over the Cliq+.

Pros:
+ Takes a digital copy of the image that prints (if a Micro SD card is inserted)
+ The most recently taken picture can be reprinted with one button press  this allows you to share identical photo pictures with friends
+ Photo prints are actually stickers
+ Photos are thin and stick well, but can also generally be peeled off of surfaces without causing damage
+ Only 50 cents per picture (as compared to classic Polaroid pictures which cost $2.00 each)
+ Zinc Photo Paper is not sensitive to light (in the same way as film). This means you can open the back of the camera without worry of ruining film.
+ No ink or development chemicals to worry about
+ Allows double exposure prints (Simply re-load a picture back into the camera and take a 2nd picture that prints over top of the first. Fun & artsy!)
+ Photos print quickly (~55 seconds) and do not require time to develop (compared to Polaroid pictures which take up to 10 minutes to develop)
+ Rechargeable battery built in
+ Built in flash
+ Selfie mirror actually works reasonably well
+ Camera is available in several vibrant and fun colors 

Cons:
- Camera does not save digital images unless zinc photo paper is installed in the camera **NOTE: There is a workaround for this. See review above.
- Shutter button is far too easy to press. It offers no tactile feedback and it is very easy to accidentally take a picture (which is a waste of 50 cents).
- Camera does not have a screen
- Photo resolution is only 5 megapixels
- Camera does not have any indication of how many pictures are left (although you can take the paper out and count the sheets)
- Flash is automatic only and cannot be manually turned on or triggered
- Flash only turns on in very dark conditions
- Once the camera is powered off, it can no longer re-print the last image that was taken (even when the image is saved on a memory card)
- Image quality on the Zinc Photo Paper is fairly poor (this seems to be related to the 5 megapixel resolution of the camera)
- Water eats through the top layer of the photo paper destroying the image underneath. If rain touches an image, or if liquid is spilled on a photo  they will be ruined. Keep in mind, these are stickers  so they may end up on notebooks or other areas that kids might splash or get wet.
- The back of the stickers are difficult to peel away (there should be a slit on the back of the paper  instead of needing to be peeled at the corners)
- No battery indicator
- Does not include a Micro SD memory card
- The cost of Zink photo paper is the same price regardless of the quantity you buy (50 cents per 2x3 inch sheet)"^3^Apr 30, 2019 10:06 AM
TechEnthusiast^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^20^7^"Im not going to beat around the bush. The Canon Ivy Cliq is a truly awful camera that isnt worth the money. Do yourselves a favor and dont buy it. 

Ive seldom encountered a product with no redeeming features or use cases, but I can honestly say that this camera is a complete and total waste of plastic. 

The camera is made of light-weight plastic and feels cheap in the hand. My camera was yellow, but the entire back of the camera is a glossy white plastic that will start to look dirty within a couple days of use. 

The camera has four buttons on it: power, shutter, aspect ratio, and duplicate photo. The camera has no LCD screen to it, and there are no menus or options whatsoever. Once you click the shutter button, the camera prints the photo (no matter how bad it is). There is no app, this doesnt pair with your phone, and you cant cancel the print if you know its going to turn out poorly. This was okay with the original Polaroid cameras of the late 80s and early 90s back when you were getting instant gratification instead of going through the hassle of getting film developed, but this is quite frankly unacceptable in 2019. 

The camera does have a spot for a micro-SD card. If you should somehow blindly luck into a decent photo, you can retrieve it from the SD card to share or print later. And trust me, you will be blindly lucking into decent photos. The positioning of the optical view finder is awkward, and its somewhat painful to use unless youre open to smashing your nose into the back of the camera. 

The cameras strap is a MAJOR design flaw. Its positioned in the upper left-hand corner of the camera, and it dangles right in front of the printer. Theres a reason that the Polaroids of old spat the picture out through the front. With this camera, you have to move your left hand out of the way, and hold the strap so that it isnt in the way of the printer. Im at a loss as to why they thought this was a good idea. 

The instructions recommend that you be within 1.6 feet of the subject of your photo. At this distance, I found that the flash washed out my subject rather badly. It should be noted that there is no way to turn off the flash with this camera. 

The camera holds ten sheets of instant photo paper and the blue data sheet that comes with the pack. My very first print jammed until I took the paper out and lightly fanned it before putting it back in. The paper is fairly expensive at the time of this review, and youre not going to want to waste a single print. 

At 5 megapixels, this camera has the same resolution as my first digital camera from 2003. Given the size of the print (2x3 inches), the prints look okay. 

If I could return this camera, I would in a heartbeat. 

I do not recommend buying this camera. Spend a little more and get something better, or buy a standalone mobile, instant printer and use your smartphone instead."^1^Apr 24, 2019 7:38 AM
DocCupCake^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"Have you ever been taking a picture and thought wow I wish I could just have an instant picture to have and share?

Well look no further Canon has made the IVY CLIQ to fill your instant picture needs! This compact lightweight camera takes a beautiful picture and prints it out in under a minute! No more uploading and going to the store!

So, what are the core features of this camera you may wonder?
 Snap 5 MP photos to print instantly
 Take great selfies with the Selfie Mirror
 Print fun 2'x3' photos in 50 seconds or less
 Every photo has a peel & stick back
 Save all your photos with the MicroSD card slot
 Simply press the reprint button right on the camera and print an additional 2x3' photo to share with friends

Unboxing the camera was straight forward and came with a 10-sheet picture pack to print on. It is recharged by small microUSB cable (included). The camera is thin and compact enough to hold in your hand or use the included strap. The camera does sport some trendy colors such as the Seaside Blue (which is the one I have), Bumble Bee Yellow or Lady Bug Red! So, whatever your personality is the color is there to fit!

So, lets get to the details! Does it work?

Oh, does it! This camera sports some quick printing time and looks high quality for the 2x3 format. Once you print the photos you can choose to stick them on stuff, or you can make a collage as they are a nice 2x3 size (perfect for those baby books and scrapbooking! 

Selfie Mode?

Yes, this camera has a faux selfie mode by including a small selfie mirror on the front so you can get that perfect angle of that perfect moment. Nice thing is you can hit the reprint button and reprint that selfie again and give to your friend or loved one no need to take another photo.
So how long doe sit last on one charge? 28 photos printed on one charge for me. Which isnt that bad considering you arent going to be taking hundreds of these at a time. It only takes 90 minutes to fully recharge the battery. It does have an auto off feature after approx. 5 min so need to worry if you leave on by accident.
The ZINK Photo paper Packs are inexpensive at 5 packs for $25 at the time of this review.

My Final Impressions-

This camera comes in a time where cellphones are doing the quick pictures. This camera brings back that feeling of fun memories with instant gratification of having a physical product post picture. You can save and share on the microSD card, but this camera really shines with its instant print features in very bright settings some colors bleed a little but minor. I really enjoyed using this for those moments I wanted a permanent memory that could be saved physically for years to come! Canon nailed bringing fun back to taking memories in a time of all digital."^5^Apr 24, 2019 3:33 PM
RedScorpion^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^8^1^"The Canon IVY Cliq is an update on the old Polaroid of years ago. It produces zero ink pictures and it does a good job. 

The instant ink photos feel a bit like a gimmick, but they are fun. Last summer I picked up a Polaroid Onestep and I was incredibly disappointed. the pictures looked awful, and the film was incredibly expensive. Thankfully, the Cliq suffers from none of those problems. On a single charge, I was able to take ten pictures and the pictures came out looking pretty good.

I compared the IVY Cliq with the HP Sprocket instant ink printer. I took one picture with my phone and the other with the Cliq. I probably got more fine detail with the Sprocket, but the colors looked better with the IVY. Also, there was less banding and distracting lines with the IVY. The photos looked more like actual, tiny photos. 

The camera itself comes with a tiny selfie mirror built in along with a slot for a micro-sd card to back-up pictures. Both worked as expected. I wish this camera had a digital view screen and a way to print photos from my phone, but as an instant point and print, it works well.

My general attitude with reviews is 'did the item work as described and did I enjoy it?'. The IVY more than met those expectations. I wish it had Bluetooth built-in (I believe the more expensive models do), but I can't fault this model as it is good at what it does.

I think the cameras are fun and look snappy, the prints look good, the film isn't too expensive (last I checked you can get a pack of 20 shots for $10), and the device is simple and reliable. Easily recommend to friends and family.

Note: With Mother's Day /graduations coming up, I think these cameras will make for a good gift. Combine the camera with a photo album for small prints, and really make their day."^5^Apr 23, 2019 1:38 PM
TechnicallyCorrect^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^1^"As Best Buy Insider, I hate giving a bad review . However, let me be clear, the Canon Ivy Cliq camera is a truly awful waste of money. When you first take the camera out the box, it looks good. Nice color, seems to be decent craftmanship. It has some heft to it. Then you notice things that are move evident in the specs. No screen. Weak flash. Little to no memory. No app. 5MB photos. No Bluetooth. No NFC. That is correct, 5MB. The lack of screen is acceptable because it is an instant camera, but pictures on a digital camera that are only 5MB? So maybe the prints are okay at 5MB because they are only 2 X 3. Not even close. The colors are completely off - skin tones are reddish, whites are yellow and there is an odd washing out on the edges. I tried multiple different lighting scenarios and they all came out terrible. So in thinking about, the 5MB does not really matter. The reality is you can print photos 3 times the size at 5MB if the lens is good and the print media is good. Therein lies the problem. You have a tiny lens and the Zink media is very poor quality. Bad combination. The competition offers digital cameras with instant printing with 10 to 20 MB, wider lenses, Bluetooth, screens and more. If you look at the non-digital instant cameras, you find much more features and much, much better image print quality. Then the competition does all that at a lower price. The reality is this is a product with no target customer. The image quality is too low for the enthusiast. The lack of screen will not get the under 30 customers. The camera is basically a toy and that will not get the teens ( which seem to be their target customer from the ads.) The price of $99 will not get parents to buy for kids. This should have been a $50 camera marketed kids who will use it a couple of times and put it in drawer. 

 In summary  poor features, poor functions, poor price. This is the worst Canon product Ive ever owned. Nothing to look at here, move on to the competition that just does a better job. Sorry Canon, I usually like your products but - uugghhh....."^1^Apr 29, 2019 8:16 PM
psyclopps^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"This is a great entry level camera. Especially for kids and pre-teens. They can learn basic photography techniques and have a lot of fun with the built in printer. 

Unboxing: The box is pretty plain but shows an accurate depiction of the device, it looks to be about full size in the pictures. The contents are basic documentation, the device, 10 ZINK sheets, a wrist strap and a micro USB cable. I wish it was USB-C but it is what it is. 

Product: The build quality is study plastic. It is glossy which looks great but could be an issue if you are giving the device to someone you know will abuse it, it will pick up lots of scratches over time. I think this product would have been better with a matte finish or even a cheap metal body. There is a basic viewfinder, mirror for selfies and flash on the front. The top has a power button, shutter and shutter. The bottom has a micro USB port, a micro SD card slot, charge indicator and reset button. The back has the viewfinder, a copy button, and a button to size your prints in 2x2 or 2x3 inches. 

Setup: It is very straightforward. Make sure it is charged, insert the paper in the device. I highly recommend a micro SD card for permanent copies. 

Use: Using the viewfinder you will have no issues lining up your pictures. It saves seamlessly to the memory card but keep in mind there is no internal memory so you will need to insert a card if you want copies for later. Most of the time the flash will go off and you will quickly get a print. I recommend you set it to 2x3 photos since it will fill up the paper but you will also have the option for 2x3 if you wish which will give you a small border on the bottom. I you put in a memory card you will get 5 MP photos which dont look too bad for what it is. The battery is rated at around 25 photos. I assume this is with print. It takes about a minute to print out a photo after each photo. 

Print quality: It is a mixed bag. You have to remember this is not a high end camera and best used for kids or people who just want some picture stickers. The picture quality is not very detailed in the prints and is heavy on the red tint. I posted two photos to show you. Also, the pictures double as stickers. You can peel the back and put them in a book or on the wall. They tend to bend easily after being stuck on a wall or a while (also seen in the pictures). The prints are cheap and you can get a 20 pack for under 10 bucks, look or deals on this. 

Summary: Though this device is nothing to write home about, it is fun. It is exciting. Kids and family who are not that into tech will love it. Professional photographers definitely won't use this for any projects, but I would be they would have fun with it too as it makes a great toy. 

It is very much entry level and geared toward a young audience. Try one out if you get a chance."^4^Apr 24, 2019 12:39 AM
RandallFlagg^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^2^"I have an AS in photography and for a Canon product, the Cliq is fairly disappointing. I realize it's only 5 megapixels, but the color quality, grainy photos and the awkwardness of the camera make it a two for me. The one good thing it has going for it is that its size is nice to fit in a pocket. 

I tried a couple of shots indoors and they either came out dark because the flash failed to fire or they are hot with the blacks not really black and tons of reflection off of the subject. Many of the colors fail to reproduce to the actual item, with many of them looking washed out.

The camera has very basic controls. Power button, shutter button, print button and aspect ratio 2x2 or 2x3 depending if you shoot regular or portrait. The power button is really easy to brush and hit while you are handling it. It doesn't seem to bother the function as it takes a press and hold to power up or down the unit. It does bother me a bit when I accidentally hit it. Other than those buttons, you can't control anything. There is no manual flash that I could see or read about in the manual. The manual is actually just a quick start guide in a few languages. It doesn't give you much and can quickly cause a headache as you try to decipher each step in your spoken language. It's really bunched up to save data or paper. The FAQ on this unit doesn't answer many basic questions. I imagine it's because of the newness of the item. I went to see why my photos were dark and how to turn the flash on. I'm guessing it is a German Flash and is always on Otto (auto). Sorry, photography humor! 

I wish I had some good things to say, but I can only think of two. One I stated above that the camera is light and fits into a front pocket or purse. Two, I could see how this would be fun with a group while taking photos, selfies, or on an outing where the quality of the photo isn't as important as the event. Just being able to snap some pics and share the small instant prints would be enjoyable for most if not all.

I'd recommend the camera if you fall into the group that loves to snap photos and share right then and there. Otherwise, I believe there are far better options for a point and shoot camera."^2^Apr 23, 2019 8:04 PM
Txstatesal^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Family and friends won't stop asking me to take their picture and if it was filled with endless film I sure would but it got to the point where I put this little winner away because I wanted to be able to choose when to snap a pic. 

I love instant film cameras and cameras of all sorts because they all have great uses. For instance the Cliq came in handy recently on my way to Disney World when I realized how easy it would be to get my pictures fast and on the spot. As opposed to the person who works there and then going to find the venue that develops them.

The color of yellow is just as vibrant as the picture online, the pictures are of good quality, the fact that I can add a SD card is a perk and I hope the buy a neck strap to take this camera to the next festival here in town! 

It doesn't have a lcd screen to review pictures but that's okay because this is more for point, shoot and printing. 

I am so ecstatic about the Cliq and I am looking forward to many weekend trips with it."^5^May 1, 2019 6:53 PM
DavidJr^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^4^"Though this camera is fun and cute, it really makes you realize how far we have come along in small digital cameras to roll back to something like this. It is somewhat satisfying to snap a shot and in less than a minute have it printed out and ready to stick anywhere. However, when you snap that shot and then wait one minute to realize you just wasted about 50 cents to get a bad picture that you need to take again, it gets disappointing quick. Using the tiny selfie mirror, for the most part came out just as expected, but using the tiny viewfinder and the very faint sight picture I had a lot of chopped off pictures. However, with any camera, a little experience with it does tend to get better, but that is $$ wasted each time. If you get the refill paper in bulk, you can get the cost per picture down a fair bit. But, being that there is absolutely no way to preview the shot before printing, it really just feels like Im wasting money and time to find out it was not the shot I was looking for. 

With everything auto for this camera, it really is just point and shoot. However, feedback is a little slow and the single led just blinks in all sorts of fashion. There is the capability to save the pictures on a micro sd card and they are actually a bit larger than what is printed. As in the printed pictures are a cropped version of the original. However, their quality, at 5MP, is fairly low. But, being that they were only meant to be printed on a 2x3 inch piece of paper, they dont need a lot. The only problem is, this model has no way of selecting and printing any of those other pictures again. You can reprint the last picture, but that is it.

The quality of the prints arent bad. Id say better than classic Polaroid pictures, but far less than ink jet printer images. Even a cheap ink jet printer prints larger and better quality pictures. To me, it looked like a blue hue to every picture I took, especially in shadows and gradient areas. Like there isnt actually a black in the zero ink process but a really deep blue. But other colors were surprisingly vibrant. 

In general, this camera is fun, but being that I have been spoiled with modern digital cameras where I can choose to save or delete the image, especially before putting it to paper, I feel like I went back in time. A time where we had no idea what our pictures truly looked like till they were developed. At least the picture is developed in a minute compared to the old 1 hour photo. But, even then, it just doesnt fully feel worth it to me."^2^Apr 29, 2019 3:18 PM
stevefromtheburbs^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"For those of us who grew up with cameras that were able to print instantly, and the miracle that grew before our eyes, this is a great throwback to those times with the technology of today. A great marriage. 

The negatives I have that prevent a full 5 stars is that the shutter button is positioned so that you hit it by mistake, waisting an expensive print. It should be recessed or require more effort to press, to prevent this from happening. Also, I want to tell you that you cannot just use this as a digital camera, only can you save images if you use a micro SD card and only what you print. This is a disappointment. 

Now, the positives, and there are many. The selfie mirror on the front is ingenious! It helps to use something simple to help you get a great picture. The size and feel of the camera is superb, feels solid and not at all cheesy. It has a feel of a much more expensive camera. The print quality of the images is outstanding! They come out quick and very decent. I've used another similar product and simply cannot compare to this camera. 

This is a unique product with an audience wanting to discover what we grew up with, a print that comes out instantly that can be left behind without having to email something to someone and maybe print it, and you forget to do it, and those images are just forgotten about. Print it on the spot, give it to someone who will really enjoy it and hold onto it. It is a top quality print and I really enjoy using it. I've purchased additional paper for it which equates to $.50/print, and for what it is, it is worth it. 

If you want something unique that may or may not have been experienced by someone today, this is a #1 gift for them. Or for yourself. Rediscovering how to print and give someone a picture they can hang onto is refreshing and something I really have enjoyed using."^4^Apr 24, 2019 9:57 PM
OmieOne^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"This isn't a bad camera. Its about as good as a cell phone camera from about 2 years ago, so the pictures are decent and the fact it prints 2x3 pictures on stickers made it super fun for my tween and friends. They giggle up a storm as they setup funny shots and used the sticky backs. Honestly watching them goof off made the camera worth and the print quality from the zink paper is quite good, I took a picture of my kids and shoved it in my wallet.
Just note if you do give to a tween you will burn through the Zink paper like mad, but I didn't mind because they are all having fun with it and I am able to sneak a few cute pictures of my own.
It does have a MicroSD card slot on the bottom to save the pictures to be transferred to a computer if you want as well.
Overall this is a great camera. Is it something for professional use, no, but it's good for fast snaps of the family and just enjoy and have fun with something analog in a digital age."^5^Apr 24, 2019 6:56 PM

Maybe I am missing the point...

OK. Maybe I am missing the point. I have the Canon Ivy Printer, and I use it as needed when I find a picture I want to print out. It does a really nice job for a small format print. So I was intrigued when I found the IVY Cliq Camera. I was excited when the package arrived looking forward to having camera and printer in one package.

After opening the package, the excitement quickly died.

I grew up back when instant cameras were a thing. Film cameras were the norm. Digital cameras were not a thing yet. The fun part of taking pictures back then was seeing how they turned out after waiting an hour at the local photo lab. Then you start going thru the pictures and were lucky to get 3 or 4 good shots of people in a 36 picture roll. The odds of someone not blinking or making a odd face were pretty slim. 

Instant cameras were fun too as you took the picture and stood there like a fool waving it in the air trying to get it to develop quicker. The fun there was watching the photographer and seeing the disappointment as they see the picture was nowhere near as good as they had hoped as cousin Jimmy decided to stick a finger in someone's nose.

Why do I bring up this memory? At 50 cents per sheet, taking a photo to be instant printed is not cheap. It would be very easy to go thru 10 pictures and not get a good one. 

Clearly there must be a way to take a picture and view it before it prints. Right? Maybe a app that sends the photo over Bluetooth...but then why not just use the phone to take the picture? But don't worry Canon took care of that...there is no app...there is no Bluetooth...there is no control over what prints. All pictures print, even the nose picking Jimmy pictures.

That is OK, I thought. I just won't load the paper, save the image to the micro SD and figure out how to get the right photo to print later. 

Nope. The camera will not take a photo without the paper.

Clearly this wasn't right. I go to Canon's support page. 

Nope. You can't take a picture with no paper. 

OK, this can be fixed in a firmware update I am sure. I'll download the software and see what the firmware update process is like. 

Hmmm? No software for the camera. I am now assuming no firmware updates either.

So I have a camera with a SD slot that will not take pictures without 'film' being in this digital camera.

A 5 megapixel camera? You honestly could buy a cheap cell phone and have similar results.

I am not sure who this camera is for nor why it exists in this format. Buying just the IVY printer and using your phone will give better results and known results.

Honestly I can not recommend this camera in any sense of the word. It might be more tolerable if the paper was cheaper and affordable, less than 10 cents a sheet seems about a right price point. But for the gamble of taking a good pic and no way of editing the picture before print and the hassle of having to have extra paper available if you are taking a lot of shots... I'll stick to my cell for everyday shots and break out the DSLR for special moments or projects. 

For the life of me, I don't know who the target consumer is for this camera. The prints are so small that older people won't be able to see them. The price per shot is too high for most people sub 30 years old to find affordable. The inability to just take a digital picture is a waste. 

The beauty of digital photography is the ability to correct a picture before publishing or printing. This works against the grain of the advantages of digital photography.

For less than 10 cents an image, I can select the photos I want printed and pick them up in an hour or have them shipped to me. Or I can wait 30 seconds to get a picture I am not sure of with cousin Jimmy and his stray finger.

It comes with one package of 10 sheets of Canon Zink Paper. It is easy to load and it calibrates the camera with a blue sheet that spits out first. You have the option to take take 2x3 or 2x2 pictures. The Zink photo paper is a very durable sticky paper (which is why I guess it runs about $.50 a sheet before tax). The camera comes with one package of 10 sheets -which I really wish it came with more. There is no digital screen on this camera so it's really like a point and click. You can take selfies by looking in the small 'selfie mirror' (which mimics a mirror in a park bathroom). Overall, it's a cool concept and the paper that the pictures are printed on is durable. I find it to be a little overpriced for the overall basic print a picture on demand camera."^4^May 7, 2019 6:29 PM
Bappy^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The Canon IVY CLIQ Instant Camera is a gimmicky point and shoot camera that prints each picture you take on Peel & Stick ZINK Photo Paper. The paper costs about fifty cents a 2x3 inch sheet and fits in the camera like a small deck of cards. Taking pictures is pretty easy, actually a bit too easy as the shutter button is way too easy to trigger when handling the camera. I took one accidental picture after loading in the paper. The camera is pretty basic with a fixed lens, an auto flash and a selfie mirror on the front. With this basic model, there is no way to take a picture, preview and then print. Press the shutter button and you print (along with saving the image to a micro SD card). As for the prints, they are fairly basic and look like a bit flat color wise. Given the quality (or lack of) the prints and small size (dont expect 70/80s era instant prints) I cant really recommend the camera. My teen children did think instant prints were pretty cool though, especially with the sticky backing for placement on a surface.

Pros:

- Instant prints
- Camera looks cool
- SD card for storing images you took

Samrio^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This camera does exactly what it's designed to. It's not here to take the most fabulous instant prints you've ever seen, nor does it have advanced features that allow you to capture a high resolution picture. However, what it does do, it does well. It's great for printing little photos of random memories, with a retro feel. The print quality is as expected for something like this. It's not going to have the best quality image, but it is going to capture a small memory, one photo at a time. The prints don't take super long to print, but you will have to wait for the picture to dispense before you start hitting another photo. The paper is easy to load, and I recommend grabbing a pack or two. I shot through the initial pack within a couple of hours walking around the park. You can select the orientation and the size of the photo (for extra writing space). The included adhesive, allows it to be put on a wall, or any appliance that allows a post-it to stay on.

If you've ever had a Polaroid instant camera, this will bring back all those memories in a smaller package. Whatever you do, don't try to compare this to a high end camera, you'll be disappointed at the low res prints."^5^May 5, 2019 1:48 PM

Now many different camera makers have made instant cameras. This camera is one of cannon's iterations and i personally am a fan. The camera is self is very compact and it takes decent quality photos. One of the biggest advantages is that the camera allows for a memory card and each picture is saved with a digital copy on the memory card. My only wish is that you were able to take digital pictures without having film in the camera but it does not appear to be possible. Overall i believe this is a fun camera to throw in a bag and take on vacation. I also love that the pictures are able to be peeled and have a sticky back. This would also be a great camera to get a child who is interest in taking pictures."^4^Apr 30, 2019 11:39 AM
WyldeBlue^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^1^"PROs:

- Actually delivers decent picture quality for an instant, selfie-centric camera/printer...colors had a bit more pop than those old Polaroids, especially when printed on a canvas small enough that you really didn't/couldn't notice any flaws in the digital image itself
- Audible sound cues and status LEDs give you indications as to current status of image proportions, power, internal printer & SD card activity, etc.
- As much as I thought the little selfie mirror on the front was a bit cheesy at first, it actually does a GOOD job of allowing you to frame your subjects in the shot...a must for what seems like the target audience for this little gadget
- Framing marks in the viewfinder also help you properly compose your subjects within the shot if you happen to be shooting from behind the camera
- Everything you need is right there in the box including a charging cable, starter Zink paper, and carrying strap...my camera even came nearly fully charged
- Built-in LED flash provides at least cell-phone level illumination in darker environments so you never miss that critical selfie or shot of Big Foot strutting past the front of your car on a country road
- With an SD card on board, your images are saved even after the paper runs out so you can transfer them to a PC or other device down the road

CONs:

- Only delivers 'decent' picture quality on a relatively small canvas (2x3 or 2x2 inches); things are a little redder, a little duller, a little darker maybe...you are getting convenience and gadget-level fun factor here--this is not a camera for capturing serious/long-term memories
- Digital images saved on the SD card are grainy and loaded with digital/compression noise--okay for tiny locker frames, stickers, or scrapbook embellishments, but you don't really gain much by transferring them to a PC for manipulation in a photo editing program--think a 2008-2010 era cell-phone camera and you've got the general idea of what to expect
- You have to completely unwrap the photo paper, handle it with your bare hands, and load it in the camera with the proper 'smart starter page' face down...an error-proof cartridge would have been preferable to ensure you didn't contaminate the printing surface or accidentally load the paper incorrectly
- If you have paper loaded in the camera, you can take pictures even without an SD card inserted, but if you only have an SD card loaded, you can't take any pictures at all--this ensures that even if that once-in-lifetime UFO landing is happening right outside your door, you're going to miss the shot unless you have some Zink paper on board...just know up front that even though this feels like a 'regular' digital camera, it is ONLY useful as such for printing out pictures as you take them
- Printing speed was a bit slower than the older Polaroids that inspired it (for those of you who even remember using a Polaroid camera); you can easily spit out one image in about 30-45 seconds and be ready for the next shot, but it's slow enough to take you 'out of the moment' if you have a few shots in a row you were hoping to take
- The 'print again' button simply has a picture of a sun over some mountains with a small offset frame behind it to suggest a second image--it's not an obvious choice in iconography and could easily confuse someone you loaned your camera to ('Hey, should I reset the focus to 'nature scene'...oh, shoot--I just reprinted that photo instead, sorry!)
- It's not a big deal, but if you use the recommended Canon Zink photo paper, your first photo will take at least 2x as long to print because the camera has to spit out the cardboard starter 'smart sheet' before it moves on to printing from the first sheet of actual photo paper
- The LED status light on top tries to do a bit too much for me to decipher without the instructions handy--status indicators from that single LED slit are white, red, blue, cyan, magenta (seriously!), and yellow with blinking, looping, and combinations of those colors all trying to tell you different things. I get it--the focus is on fun so why not use a bunch of fun colors, but would something like a little light next to an SD card icon be SO hard just to reduce the amount of stuff I have to remember?

Summary review:

Everything about this camera screams fun and cutesy...the color choices are cute, the selfie mirror is actually kind of cute (as well as being surprisingly more useful than I expected), the little Zink paper packets are cute, the little sounds it makes when you take a picture are cute, the changing LED colors in the status indicator are cute (if not a bit cryptic in their meaning)--the whole package is just very...cute. If that's what you're after, this is a great little gift for the budding photographer/selfie-addict in you or your family. My daughter and I had a blast shooting off photos at the Endgame premier and she loves the instant gratification the in-camera printing provides for those spontaneous 'photo needs' with her friends. Sure, the images are tiny once they're printed, and the digital files left behind on the SD card aren't archival quality or really even frame-worthy, but that's not what this camera is about, nor does it ever claim to be. Just like those disposable cameras people use at parties, this is all about having a fun little record of that special moment, but with the added benefit of getting a printout of that moment while you're still IN the moment. I wish the camera could hold a few more sheets of Zink paper (only 10 per load) and an indicator of how many sheets are left in the hopper would be a BIG help; but for spur-of-the-moment, 'I don't really need anything better than a cell-phone quality photo to print out for keeps or to share with someone anyway' occasions, this is a great little camera that's sure to be a hit. Easily recommended for what it does..."^4^Apr 26, 2019 6:11 PM
DarR^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I grew up in an era where photos were printed. This does the same--- only instantly! The camera looks sleek and is light. Taking photos is easy-- it takes some getting used to the framing, especially being used to phone cameras. This is hard when you cannot review your live shots before it gets printed out. So it requires a learning curve. Photo quality is so-so. It's not crisp and is sometimes dark-- even in well-lit situations. Same as the regular photo prints in the 80s. So plainly, this camera is just for plain fun especially that the photo sheets can be used as stickers. I'm sure baby boomers and little kids will love this --- the photo sheets are not cheap though. It can act as a regular camera given the extra SD card slot, but, almost everyone has a smartphone, that I'm sure takes more photos. Artistic people can have a use for this too. Overall, it is a fun camera. Something to use as a back-up to take instant souvenirs."^2^Apr 26, 2019 2:03 PM
Trobadour^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"---SETUP---
The setup of this Canon IVY Cliq is simple. It uses a rechargeable battery pack and you recharge the camera via USB, like you would most modern technology. On a full charge, you get 90 minutes of constant use.

---FEATURES---
The key feature of this camera is that it is also an instant printer, akin to the Polaroid cameras of yesteryear. It has a small mirror in the front to facilitate selfies, autofocus, a strap that can go on the left or right side of the camera, and an SD card you can insert if you want to save the pictures for later view. It doesnt have a menu screen and you cannot preview the photo you have taken before printing it. Its basically a point and shoot camera for instant print on a 2x3 sheet or a 2x2 format with a white, Polaroid like look. 

---PERFORMANCE---
This camera is functional but basic. Since you cant preview the pictures before they print, you hope that whatever you aimed at will come out clear and as intended. That, some may say, is part of the fun. When you install a new set of 10 ZINK photo paper pack sheets, you must put an included blue card to calibrate the camera. Its ok to take a picture with that blue card in there as it will come out and then your first picture will follow after that. It works great during bright lights (a sunny day or indoors) but not so well in the dark. If you need to make a duplicate to share, theres an included button that allows you to do just that. This specific model, though, doesnt connect to the Ivy Camera app for further customization. The Ivy Cliq + does.

---EXPECTATIONS---
This camera is not meant to replace any professional level camera or even you phone camera. Rather, it is meant to add an instant gratification in knowing that you can share a physical copy of your photos with those involved. In that sense, the camera does meet my expectations.

---VALUE---
The price for the camera in terms of value makes it approachable, but you need to remember that each ZINK photo pack will run you at about 10 dollars for 20 prints, or about .50 cents per sheet.

---APPROVAL---
I recommend this product for early teenagers since the pictures themselves can be used as stickers. I can see friends wanting to stick these on their lockers, notebooks, and other places."^4^Apr 24, 2019 8:08 PM

JBCTECH^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The Canon - IVY Cliq Instant Film Camera is a handy device for very specific applications. If you're looking for an all-around camera, look somewhere else. This is simply a modern application of the old Polaroid experience - take a picture and get a print. I also have one of the new Polaroids and, aside from the nostalgic form factor, I like this better - mainly because the print out of the photo is much quicker.

There are some tweaks that could improve this - such as built-in memory with the option of whether or not to print a shot immediately (for when you know you moved or slipped and don't want to waste the photo paper). 

Otherwise, the primary use I can see is for social gatherings where you want to stick immediate pics up somewhere for people to see. Would be fun for a kids' birthday party, etc. We'll probably use it in a Sunday School class so new kids can have their name and picture on a board with others.

Otherwise, I'll stick with my current smartphone for normal photography needs."^4^Apr 24, 2019 12:08 PM

Being able to take tiny snapshots and turn them into mini stickers to use in any way you see fit, along with being able to share them with family or friends, is so cool! And because this instant camera/printer is slim and compact, you can take it wherever you go.

I love having color choices, and for me, the mint green is totally retro. So happy I chose this color! And, the refill sticker photo paper packs arent all that expensive either; really affordable.

You can even create mini Polaroid-esque snapshots to share, or keep. Just select the 2x2 option and turn the camera to whichever particular direction necessary to achieve your desired effect - as per the easy-to-understand instructions. Its nice having that option, too, besides the standard 2x3 photo. And the handy Reprint button makes it easy to print an instant copy of the photo you just took.

The picture quality and color clarity is what you might expect given the type of camera this is with the printer being built-in, along with the size of photo being taken. Printing time is kinda slow, but again, take into consideration what this quirky little camera is meant for.

Instructions could be a bit more informative with regards to what the micro SD card slot is useful for. Is it to be used for storing pics taken with the camera, or being able to print photos already stored on an SD card? - that is, if you were able to access and view your pics by plugging the camera into a computer and then printing your selected photos. But no. Its just for storage of the pictures you take, if you want to.

No accompanying app used with this model Ivy Cliq, either. Which is fine. The instant camera/printer itself does all that it needs to do.

The Canon Ivy Cliq Instant Film Camera/Printer would be an awesome gift idea for a teen, pre-teen, or even a college-age girl; the young or young-at-heart.

Mikepas^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This Canon camera is perfect for younger teens who I think this is geared towards. The camera itself is about the same size and a typical point-and-shoot camera. The build quality is actually much better than one would expect for a product in this category. Loading the paper is pretty straight forward and not at all difficult. The quality of the printouts is much better than most other instant print cameras.

I only have a few issues with this camera, but nothing is what i would consider a deal breaker. There is only an optical viewfinder. This is probably due to the printer elements being located on the back of the camera. This means you get no preview before it prints. You shoot a picture and it prints out. That's my only main issue with the camera so far.

Overall, if you were a fan of old school photo booths then you'll like this camera."^4^Apr 23, 2019 4:41 PM
TECHBEENGOOD^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Canon IVY CLIQ - This is my idea of a party camera. It could be a nice incentive for school-aged kids to get social and share instant photos of their friends and other party goers. For the rest of us, its a very convenient instant camera that captures a moment or makes a permanent record, with the printed result in your hand . . . now. But, instant comes with a trade-off and you wont be leaving your camera/phone home..

FRAME an image . . . CLICK . . . WAIT 30 seconds or so for a cute 2x2 or 3x3 PHOTO to pop out. Instant. Permanent. 

SETUP and USE: The photo paper loads as 10 sheet packages (a 10 sheet pack is in the box and costs approx. $10 for 20 sheets when you re-supply). You should have charged up the camera beforehand. There is NO need for ink . . . this is a special paper using technology that never needs ink. There is a microSD slot if you want to have digital backups for your computer  Just do it; trust me. [The CLIQ PLUS version of the camera adds Bluetooth connectivity and adds around $60 to the price if easier connectivity or backups are important to you.] With either version of the camera, you can also do reprints immediately after taking a picture using a top/rear button on the IVY CLIQ camera. There is a built in flash and an optical viewfinder to properly frame your pictures. I found it very easy to get an image that was always properly framed. Proper lighting was a bit trickier, but improved with experience
 
PERFORMANCE: So, how did the pictures look? Nice and sharp, but my first close-up picture was a bit washed out. A little practice recognizing how much light on my subjects was ideal, and my pictures improved to a natural, colorful print. Sure, they were not as richly intense as I can accomplish with my newest Canon home printer, but thats why I put a microSD card to print out those backups at home. According to Canon, this version of the IVY CLIQ has a 5-megapixel resolution, and at these small photo sizes, the prints are pretty and natural looking. The backing of the print can be peeled away to reveal adhesive, if you want to decorate stuff.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I suppose you could think of this Canon Ivy CLIQ as a nostalgic throwback, with some updates. It is reminiscent of those instant cameras we first saw in the 1950s-60s. I like the idea of encouraging social interactions and creating instant memories while the party is still on. I think imaginative kids, especially, will find ways to capture their world, decorate their stuff, and explore artistic projects. I can recommend this camera, with the caveats Ive noted."^4^Apr 23, 2019 12:49 PM

It prints out a 2x3 photo that has a backing on it that can peel off to be made a sticker! Setup is a breeze. It comes with everything you need to get started. I charged up the device and inserted the zink paper. This thing has no print cartridge nor requires any ink! It's all in the paper!

One thing I liked about the camera is it's simplicity. It has 2 buttons. ON/OFF and the shoot button. How simple!! I snapped a couple of photos to test it out and I was so surprised by the picture quality. It makes a great little photo that is sharp and clear! It took some work to get the sticker backing off, but before long I was sticking little pics all over the house, much to the chagrin of my wife. Think of all the little photos I can leave around the house for her to find!!

I loved this camera! I give it 4 stars for it's fun factor, ease of use, and simplicity. I did not give the 5th star because I feel that the paper is a little pricey at 50 cents per sheet."^4^Apr 23, 2019 9:43 AM

That is not to say that I cant have fun with instant film camera such as the Canon IVY Cliq. After all, instant cameras were a big thing when I was a teen. I even tried one recently and I liked it but I am sad to say that even my ten-year old did not like this one.

The pictures came out either too orange or too red in every situation. In low lighting, they were grainy and extremely dark. The flash made things even worse in that type of situation, with spots of intense reflection. In good lighting, it came out slightly better but not by much. The fact that it has no way of previewing the pictures before printing them, make it a waste of money, especially with the film you need to buy without the option of seeing whether it is worth it to print before you do so. If the quality was mostly good, this would not be a big deal but the fact that it is not takes the fun away.

You can save the pictures to an SD card but you will need a computer to see them. By then, youd better off with a pocket photo printer that you can connect to your phone, which probably can take much better pictures anyway. 

It feels cheap and seems to be designed with kids in mind but my younger daughter did not enjoy it either despite her initial enthusiasm.

The pros are few but size is one of them. It is also light, easy to use and charged via USB. It has a small mirror for selfies but it did not impress me. I do like Canon but I cannot recommend this camera"^2^Apr 25, 2019 8:26 AM
Ebonovic^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"Welcome back the classic instant camera; as in physical picture in your hand. 

The good: It is lightweight, it is not a very heavy camera. Has fair picture quality, and it does produce a physical picture that develops in under 1 minute. 

The not-so-good: You need basically FILM cartridges for the pictures. And they are not-in-expensive. about $10 a refill, thus making each picture cost about $0.50. When learning how to use the camera, we used up over half of the included cartridge. 

There are two settings for picture size, that got a bit confusing for her to use at first... now that she knows, setting it is okay. 

Two times in picking up the camera (that was on), we hit the easy to push shutter button, which caused us to take two instant pictures of our palm. 

There is no digital screen, as most young users are used to. So you don't get to pick and choose what picture looks best to print, and no way to make duplicates of the same photo for all the friends squished into it. 

It is a small print, about 2'x3'... not the full-sized Poloroids from 'back in the day'.

Overall, the quality of the camera seems nice... but if this is going to be a primary use camera, be prepared for the cost on the supplies and the small print size."^3^Apr 24, 2019 8:48 AM
nhtechie^/canon-ivy-cliq-instant-film-camera-ladybug-red/6344510?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^1^"I love Canon cameras - and I used to love the Polaroid Instant photos when I was a kid. So, the combination of these two was very appealing to me. Well, not to me - but to my kid.

Its kind of big for kids hands, so its good that there is a wrist strap. Theres an SD card slot, so you can keep a digital image with the physical image. Mine was mint green - but thats just the front; the back was white and it looks like it could be a dirt magnet.

The images were just not great. Well, if this was a $30 camera then itd be on par - but not for one retailing around $100.

Some images had lines, others were fine (see attached images). We fell victim to the duplicate photo press and were stuck with a wasted dupe photo (also in included images). I got this as a product to review, so I found it strange that it only came with the 10 sheets (default in the box) to write a review with. Normally, we get extra accessories to ensure we get a lengthy review session, but 10 photos went *poof* pretty fast. 

There is a Blackberry-esque selfie mirror on the front - which does the job. 

When you take a photo, shortly after you hear the rollers start and you want to turn the camera over. Well, for both my wife and I, we ended up hitting the shutter button at that time, firing off another photo, which in-turn kicks off another print job. Mine mis-shoot was of the ceiling, my wifes was of the sky - so, pretty consistent: up (yes, in the attached photos too!). That really needs to be fixed - make the button more rigid, or have it print out a different side. Something. 

I did go and buy a 20-pack of photo sheets, running around $0.50 a photo - which is pretty pricey for a gimmick-type little camera. So, there's $120 right out the gate - excluding memory cards. 

Overall, this is a no-go for adults. 
For kids, its a cute to have - but the price tag puts it out of that type of audiences budget. It also needs to include more sheets."^3^May 1, 2019 8:19 PM

It's very nice not needing to purchase batteries and the recharging is a really nice feature.

When I first got the camera I was looking forward to shooting random grab shots to put into a small photo book. But after using the camera and going through 20 prints, I have yet to find one that is acceptable enough to put into the photo book. 
At first I though that maybe more light would be better, but even outdoors in full sunlight, the colors are washed out and focus is hit and miss.
The camera itself is not bad, it is what you would expect from a $60 camera. No many features but really what would be expected from a camera in this price range. The camera charged quickly and was easy to load the Zink pack. It seems fairly well built and actually feels pretty good in the hand. You can put a micro SD card to save photos, but these pictures are as bad as the prints. You can change the picture size from 2x3 to 2x2, if you want, but I'm not sure why you would, the prints are already small. There is a view finder, flash and a selfie mirror on the front, but these are it for added features.
If you are looking for this size prints, I'd probably stay away from this camera and look for one of the many available 2x3 printers out there."^2^Apr 24, 2019 2:17 PM

If you want something compact, fun, easy to operate that gives instant gratification by printing a pic in an instant then this IS for you. 

There is the option to save pics you have taken on an SD card but the image quality just isnt up to par with what your cell phone can do (and who doesnt have a cell phone camera now a days?) so I would just recommend using the Cliq because you can have a pic that you take in your hand to hold within seconds. 

Its a little wonky sometimes as you really dont know how many pics you have left in your camera, I just keep taking pics until I cant take any more then reload. Its also got a selfie mirror on the front for instant selfies.

I have mirror-less SLRs that cost thousands and this obviously doesnt compare BUT for a compact camera you can take anywhere the Cliq a fun inexpensive choice.

She loved being able to get pictures of her memories, but being able to share them, physically, then and there was awesome, she said. It can even easily print multiple copies of the same picture, which is great for group photos.

The printed pictures, as well as the digital versions look great. Keep in mind that this is a 5 megapixel camera, so it isn't for high end photography, but it is great for catching memores.

It is about the size of a cell phone, so it fits easily in a purse or pocket.

I did have several issues with the camera though: The battery only lasts long enough to take and print 20-30 pictures. Also, you can't take more photos if you are out of paper, even if you have a MicroSD card installed (I believe this needs to be fixed with an update).

ENX0^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100m-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6573182?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^120^26^"I was excited when I bought the new Sony RX100M3 Camera brand new from Amazon about 3 months ago. I used it for a week on vacation and took about two thousand pictures. I have also used it for a couple day trips since then with no issue. I turned it on last week and to prepare it for my Christmas trip, format the SD cards, and set some of the presets. The camera powered on, the lens extended, but the rear screen would not display text or images. Also, all the buttons stopped working and it seemed to be stuck in movie mode, regardless of the dial settings, any button I pressed turned on and off record mode.

At that point, I checked Amazon online to see what the service policy was and where to go for support. Amazon's site said to contact the manufacturer for questions and/or repair, fair enough. So I called Sony support. The Sony tech asked me to try a couple things, power off and on, take the battery out, and finally said it sounded like a firmware issue and told me to send the camera back. He said that Sony would fix it under warranty.

I sent the camera in. A few days went by and Sony called me. They told me that the camera has some corrosion inside on the circuit boards, and said it was probably due to the humidity or moisture that may have entered the camera while in my use. I explained that I take very good care of tech gadgets and know for a fact that this camera was never exposed to any water or moisture. Apparently, corrosion is conveniently excluded from coverage under their warranty. Anyway, they told me that the repair of my camera is going to cost $225. I could either accept the fee or they would send the broken camera back to me. What was I going to do with an $800 paperweight and I really wanted this camera for Christmas photos. After trying to negotiate a more amicable solution, with no success, I agreed to the repair.

This was an $800, 'TOP OF THE LINE' Sony camera (plus case, batteries, and other accessories) that I used for one trip, owned it for a total of 90 days, and now I have to spend another $225 to have it fixed. I checked online and found a lot of similar complaints about this corrosion issue with this camera and others are in same situation having to pay out of pocket for repair. In my opinion, here are the reasons this camera failed: inferior parts; poor construction; lack of quality control; and the body is not sealed from humidity. I have gone back and forth with Sony customer support and keep hearing, 'this is our policy' and 'while we would like to help, there is nothing we can do'. I asked them to send me pictures of the corrosion, which I have not received. I can see me being charged if this was negligence on my part or if I had dropped the camera in the pool or ocean, but this camera has been dry since day 1. I don't expect every product to be perfect, if Sony would just acknowledged the camera was faulty and fix it under warranty, I would be happy.

I have several other cameras, Panasonic, Canon, and Nikon as well and iPhone, iPad, etc. Most are less expensive than the RX100M3 and some more than 10 years old. They are all still in top working condition, except for the Sony RX100M3.

Needless to say, I am very disappointed in Sony! The product quality and customer service are horrible! At one time, Sony was the go to company for high quality equipment and you didn't mind paying a little extra for it. It's just not that high quality company anymore. If Sony wont stand behind the products they sell, who will?

There are far too many quality products on the market to waste your money on this overpriced junk. It takes great pictures and has lots of features, but in my opinion the costs are not worth the risks of getting one with a corrosion issue.

This will definitely be my last Sony product!"^1^Dec 8, 2014 4:22 PM
English^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100m-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6573182?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^50^1^"I'm a very keen landscape photographer. I usually use digital SLR cameras with all the associated paraphernalia, lenses and filters.

Some time back, I started looking into using smaller cameras as carrying about all the DSLR gear was getting old. For a few years, I have been using a Canon G11, which is a great camera, but not quite up to the quality attainable from my DSLR.

When the RX100M2 came out, I was very interested because the reviews were so good. Sadly, it had no kind of viewfinder which, for me, is a requirement. I really don't like holding the camera out in front of me, trying to compose with a washed-out monitor in the sunlight.

When the RX100M3 came out, I was excited to see that they had added an electronic viewfinder, so, after much research, decided to give it a go. I figured that I could always return it within the return period if I didn't like it. It is, after all, a very expensive camera for a compact.

From the very first shot taken with this, I was amazed at the quality, and I remain amazed having taken 1,110 shots with it so far.

As an example, yesterday I took this camera, and my Nikon D7000 DSLR to the same location, and shot with both side-by-side. Loading the files onto my computer when I got home, I really could see no discernible difference between the quality of the shots from the Nikon, and this little Sony. In fact, all the shots that I ultimately used turned out to be from the Sony!

Of course, everybody's requirements in a camera differ, but I will outline some of the facets of this camera, and what makes it such an ideal camera for me:
Lens: As stated before, the quality of this camera is superb, and the lens has to take quite a large amount of credit for this. For some, they may find that it only going out to is a problem. Being a landscape photographer, I was more interested in the wide end, and was very pleased to see that Sony had widened it from 28mm in the previous models to 24mm in this model. This end of the range is far more important to me than telephoto. Of course, 70mm at the wide end may not be enough for some people -- possibly if you are intending to shoot wildlife or sports. In that case, you may be better served by one of the long-zoom bridge cameras. They will, of course, not have the image quality that this little Sony has.

It is a fast lens, being F1.8 to F2.8, although be aware that the F1.8 is only really available at the widest end. Still, F2.8 at 70mm is fine for me.

Handling: Make no mistake, this is a very small camera. This is, of course, a great asset, but it may seem a little 'fiddly' if you are used to bigger DSLRs. I personally don't find it too 'fiddly' to use, although you will have to get used to the fact that there are limited dedicated buttons so, for things like exposure compensation and other common adjustments, you will have to delve into the menus. This is actually made easier because there is a user-assignable bank of twelve settings that are easily reached from the dedicated function button. This makes on-the-fly adjustments quite easy to achieve with the minimum of fuss.

Viewfinder: For me, this is the real high-point of this camera. It is small, but bright and easy to see. I find it more than acceptable to use it to fully compose my shots. Indeed, it is my preferred method of using this camera.

I did, incidentally, find that this camera solved a real problem for me that I didn't anticipate. Being a relatively new eyeglass wearer, I always struggle with how to use my glassed when shooting. Do I adjust the dioptre for clear viewing with my glasses on? The trouble with that is that it means I can't shut out enough light at the viewfinder because my glasses are in between. Also, because you can't get your eye near enough to the viewfinder, you have trouble seeing the whole image and have to shift around to see all parts in the viewfinder. Alternatively, do I adjust the dioptre to be able to see clearly without my glasses? The trouble with that is that I can then not 'chimp', or look at the shot on the monitor without putting my glasses back on. It's a real pain. It turns out that this little Sony solves that problem for me. Because the viewfinder gives you exactly the same information that is available on the monitor, I adjust the dioptre so that I can see clearly without glasses, and just use the viewfinder to see the last shot, check on the histogram, adjust settings. In essence, I don't use my glasses with this camera. This works out perfectly for me, and is something that is not possible to do with a DSLR without EVF.

The built-in neutral density filter is a very welcome addition that I use very frequently, and I have added a filter adaptor from LensBaby which allows me to use a 52mm polarising filter.

There are lots of extra gadgets and features on this camera -- most of which I don't use. Mostly in the automatic modes and HDR, etc. Most of these don't interest me. I hear the video is supposed to be class-leading although video is also something that doesn't concern me.

If I search for some negatives about this camera, they are slight and well worth the compromise in my opinion.
I find it tends to blowing out the highlights. It is quite rare for me to take a shot where I haven't dialled in -.3 to -1.5 exposure compensation. I think that's just the price you pay for a camera which has to cater to the casual user. They lean towards a more brightly exposed shot overall at the risk of blowing highlights. No big deal.

There is no facility for remote shutter release, so I use the two-second timer most of the time when I have the camera on a tripod. I was quite disappointed to find that it was impossible to use the self-timer on most of the automatic modes or, more crucially, when using exposure bracketing. There is no point in exposure bracketing if you're going to be shaking the camera around when pressing the shutter manually! Oh well. Can't have it all.

Overall, as you can tell, I love this little camera. I really feel now that I can carry this camera around (especially as I do most of my photography travel on a motorcycle), and not feel as if I'm compromising on image quality for the sake of portability.

There's an old saying in photography that the best camera is the one that you have with you. Never has this been more true. It's always with me, plus it really is the best camera!"^5^Nov 5, 2014 8:36 PM

However, my camera died after 2 months in Central America from humidity. I took all of the precautions necessary, including dessicant packs and a dry bag. However, the moment you take the camera out in 90% humidity, you risk damage. Now imagine trying to do a timelapse for 15 minutes on a pier on the barrier reef in Belize, and imagine how much humidity the camera is being exposed to. Sony does not cover 'water damage' and will not repair or replace this camera. Many searches online find people with the same problem.

BiGGiE^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100m-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6573182?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^14^2^"I was looking for something that would be easy to carry around, especially in a pocket and take great photos. The price is steep but if you look around you will find a reasonable price for such a great camera. To preface, I used to own the QX100 that is also made from Sony and I thought upgrading to the RX100 would be a minimal upgrade at best. I was wrong. The features and control over different functions blows away the QX100. This camera is great in automatic mode but has enough tools and features to play around with if you are a professional photographer as well. The speed and ease of use is quick and easy enough for me to use it over my cell phone.

Funnest features

1) The camera is already great in low light but if needed it has a flash that articulates up that doesn't wash out your subject and allows just enough light to make a great photo out of something that wouldn't have shown up otherwise

2) Electronic viewfinder - Something I didn't think I would use that much but using it has helped to stabilize and frame my photos better.

3) NFC transfer - One of the things i loved about my previous camera was the pictures could be stored directly onto my phone to instantly share. While this feature isn't evident in the RX100, it does provide quick NFC file transfer to phones that support it (android mostly) allowing you to quickly share the file via the internet.

4) Smart remote - One thing I enjoyed from my QX100 is that i could use the phone as a remote to the camera. That is not lost on the RX100 either as the smart remote feature is built in and allows you to use your phone (via the playmemories app) to remotely snap your photo while viewing what the camera can see.

Cons

1) coming from a cell phone might take some time to get used to the RX100 as there is no touch to focus feature. Facial recognition and positioning your focus take precedence here.

2) Tad bulkier than the previous generations but fits nicely into large pockets and jacket pockets. A little tight for your straight fit jeans but still somewhat comfortable."^5^Feb 4, 2015 9:53 AM

I bought this camera as a travel companion so I don't have to lug around my DSLR and lenses. Basically I wanted to be able to put a camera in my pocket but still get a good quality image. I brought this camera to Disney World and I was extremely satisfied with the results. Once you get used to the different functions it becomes a handly little camera. I would put it at 5 stars but the price point is still a bit steep for what it is. Either way, I would recommend this to any pro photographers looking to get a travel camera that can fit into your pocket."^4^Sep 27, 2014 9:26 AM

I spend a lot of time touring by motorcycle and the DSLR gear is way to heavy and bulky for most occasions, requiring a lot of extra planning for space, etc. While I found the a6000 has all but replaced the FF DSLR, the RX100M3 has fast become a favorite. It fits easily in a pocket or tank bag, the photo quality if fantastic for its sensor size, really punching well above it's weight in the point and shoot category. Image quality is so good, that it is often compared to cameras much larger and bulkier. This is the camera that is easy to grab and have with you all the time, the one you will *want* to have with you all the time.

The camera is expensive, but if it fits within your budget, it isn't a purchase you will regret."^5^Apr 20, 2015 3:08 PM

I shopped long and hard among all the major brands. While $800 seems high for a mirrorless SLR, I am now convinced it's a good investment. I don't fully understand how the mirrorless feature works, but believe me---this camera produces fotos that are superior to those from the under $1000 mirror SLR's. My only small complaint is that deleting photos is a one foto at a time ordeal. There should be a multiple foto view display with the ability to click multiples to create a batch delete. This process is especially tortuous for numerous burst mode duplicate fotos. Maybe I'm doing something wrong because it's hard to believe that Sony could be this stupid. One more important point: I purchased this at a Best Buy store where it was a customer return. Everything was included, in perfect condition. The salesman said it was out for just one day and showed no signs of trouble. Price only $400--- Half Off!"^5^Dec 28, 2014 1:54 PM

The 1.8-2.8 aperture Zeiss lens is now the sharpest lens I own and requires no sharpening when I process my raw files. I shoot in manual mode nearly all the time which was easy to set up because of the flexibility and customization abilities of the camera.

Sure it could take a while to go through & tweak the settings to your liking, but Sony has made it quite easy to customize buttons and shortcuts so it's really not an issue. It even has a help button to explain what each function does!

It is unfortunate that it doesn't have a touch screen -- it would be cool if I could just tap anywhere on the screen and the camera will automatically focus that area.

The actual use of this camera did not live up to the hype....for me. One big complaint I have is when trying to do a selfie and the screen is in position so you can see yourself..you have to hit the shutter and then a countdown ...3 -2-1 and the shutter fires. I don't want this. I want to hit the shutter to take the photo. When I take a selfie with my young grandson I need to be in control. Maybe you can change this. I don't know. 
Another downside is the blown out highlights. For a camera in this price category and caliber that is not acceptable to me. The overall image was not as sharp as I anticipated. The exposure was not what it should been too. On playback on my computer, as you started to zoom in the image became overly pixelated. The camera had many manual controls but I feel I should get acceptable results without having to tweak every shot. Then I used my friends Canon g 7x Mark 2 and the images were spectacular on the Canon. The exposure, color, saturation, highlights, etc on the Sony was lacking compared to the Canon. Yes, you have to decide what features are important to you as each camera offers something the other doesn't. 
I wanted a EVF that the Sony has, I like the touch screen of the Canon. 
The Canon also has a bigger zoom ratio. The bottom line for me is IMAGE QUALITY. I think the Canon is much superior to the Sony. 
I guess with somethings maybe you will sacrifice quality for other features, such as portability, EVF etc. I think about the special mementos in my life, my daughters' upcoming wedding, the birth of a grandchild, first steps, birthdays, once in a lifetime vacations , etc I will choose the best image quality anytime. My choice is Canon."^1^Aug 30, 2016 1:23 PM

would be an exciting camera that deliver. Sensor Resolution is still at a high 20.2 megapixels, from the exact same backside-illuminated chip in the RX100 II. The screen can now be tilted upwards 180 degrees, or downwards 45 degrees. There's also a new XAVC S compression option, with a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (Full HD) or below, and a bit rate of 50Mbps.

The quality of photo goes beyond those of lower end point and shoot as expected for any camera in this price bracket. I opted for this over the alpha only because of the size. Otherwise it will lose out to most DSLR/Bridge cameras. Also the Mark IV just came out, although with a significant price increase, just FYI.

It also seems like making you pay $600+ for a camera isn't enough - Sony will charge you extra for unlocking certain apps. Just do a quick search for the PlayMemories Camera App and you can browse the selection.

I assumed it was time to upgrade to a 'real' camera and researched quite a bit. I really liked the Sony a6000 series, Nikon D5300 and some Canon's as well. It's tough not to drop $2,000 if you starting from scratch. I tried them out in store and in the end it was the size/bulk and potential to drop a ton of money that made me go back to looking at point and shoots. A family member is a semi pro photographer that still has a t4i sitting around with a 1.4 50mm lens. Head to head you can not tell the difference when reviewing shots on the computer. However with the Sony it is far easier to quickly make changes and see on screen how your shots will look. I was surprised that a majority of sub $1,000 dslr's do not offer this feature. I am very happy with this pocketable camera and the photo quality is that of a mid range dslr."^5^Apr 5, 2015 8:33 AM

For video, you have very sharp 1080p at 60fps, 720p at 120fps, intelligent steady shot for pro quality moves without a steady cam. This excels in photos and shoots cinema quality video.

Diverbrian^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100m-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6573182?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I will be completely honest here. I bought this thinking I would try it out and return it after my trip. I went to France for two weeks with this camera and my Nikon D750. I wound up using my Nikon 3 times for astrophotography and every other time I used the Sony. I decided to keep the camera and sell my A6000 which is what I was previously using as a travel camera. When using the kit lens on the A6000 I couldn't tell the difference in the quality between the A6000 and the RX100 III. Sony has yet to make any good lenses for that camera without going to the full-frame E mount lenses. The only improvements for my photography for this camera would be to add more magnification to the viewfinder and to not have the camera shut off when closing the viewfinder. (The latter has been corrected with the Mark V version for 500$ more.) I did add the handgrip which really made the camera handling so much better than the smooth front. I think the M5 version also has this built in now. I picked up two extra Sony batteries a charger and a screen cover and this is now my go to camera for holidays and day to day shooting. A fantastic addition to a DSLR or the perfect camera for someone who just wants to take really nice travel pictures.

PS. Since I said I was going to be completely honest I will admit to you that after the first day of shooting in full manual in constantly changing light as I went in and out of chateaus I wound up switching to full auto and with VERY few exception of tough lighting all the pictures came out amazing."^5^Apr 19, 2017 8:25 AM

Although size is one of its biggest strength, it does result in some limitations like very limited Zoom range. Also, it would have been better if it had touchscreen (comparable camera from Canon has touchscreen at a much lower price range). Also, it is very pricey for a point and shoot.

I've only owned it for about 2 months, and honestly that's not enough time to learn what this little camera can do!
1) the BEST camera is the one you have with you, and while I would stop short of calling it 'pocketable', it is small enough to take with you nearly everywhere without a big hassle.
2) Image quality is SUPURB! At 24 megapixels, there is more than enough room to crop photos to your hearts content and still have plenty of detail left to print nice 8 x 10's or larger with no worries.
3) Beginning photographers will appreciate the well-laid out and detailed menu system. Not only can the camera 'walk you through' the different shooting modes, it explains when you should use them and why. There is a shooting modes for nearly ANY possible situation, yet more advanced shooters can still take manual control over all camera functions.
4) This. Lens. Is. SPECTACULAR!!! The low light performance of this camera has to been seen to believe it!! This Zeiss 1.8 glass delivers amazingly crisp pictures WITHOUT a flash when most other cameras (including some DSLR's) would be hard pressed to capture a respectable image with one! I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but it's TRUE! Simply second to none in my opinion and I've been behind a camera since LONG before 'digital' was even a thought.
Yes....it's a little more expensive in the opinion of some people. But if you want to capture great images, instead of coming up with excuses and explaining the pictures you SHOULD have snapped, THS IS THE CAMERA TO BUY! PERIOD."^2^Oct 22, 2014 7:00 PM

My only complaint is the charging system, which requires you to take the battery out and plug it into the proprietary battery charging system. I had thought that you could use the usb data cable and plug it in to charge, but that will not work. This requires you to bring that additional accessory along with you or have multiple batteries, which usually isn't too big of a deal. Aside from that one issue, this item is definitely a good purchase. There are relatively few point and shoot cameras in this price range that also boast the 20 megapixel resolution that this does. -- This review allows only for photos to be uploaded with 5 mb or less of image size and the majority of the images that I have shot with this range between 7 mb and 12 mb, so I found 2 photos that were under this file size that were shot with the camera. They are definitely not the best ones that were shot, but may help. These were literally the only 2 I had that were under or equal to 5 mb."^4^Jul 10, 2016 11:35 AM

The shutter lag is a little annoying. I have several premium DSLR cameras that record the frame the instant the shutter button is depressed. This camera has some lag, resulting in missed action shots. But it is compact and lightweight and easy to travel with, which is why I bought it. And, the price was great.
Battery life is limited - you will need a second battery if you are going to take many pictures (50 or more) on one charge.
Setting up the software for external communication is NOT USER FRIENDLY. I ended up going to Google for further explanations. In the end I can use my cellphone as a control device. Great, but so what?

I do wish they had different colors with the wifi capability but blue is all I saw available. Great point and shoot camera that I would recommend to anyone. The only thing I did not like was it did not have a panoramic shot setting!! I like to take photos of nature and things so it was something I really wished it had. It was quick to shoot photos and adjusted well but I really couldn't live without panoramic shots so that's why I couldn't stay with just this one.

Most of the time in Auto mode most of the features seem to work just fine. It finds faces, focuses, and tracks them well. Changes to Macro for close ups. White balance under different lights keep whites white.
The WiFi has not connected. Have tried twice about a half hour each time before giving up. The memory card fits slot on computer and that works just fine.
My old camera has a dial to set basic Program settings; mountain, portrait, low light, fireworks, vivd color, etc This camera you have to use the screen and function button and then up, down, left, or right function to get to common program modes. Some settings are saved so with one button push you can get back to last setting, others are reset back to factory.
My issue is the mountain program setting which I use very often. First, it is not saved and you have to go thru about five button pushes to reset it. Second, the focus is not locked at infinity, its range is from 9 feet to infinity. Which means it keeps focusing on near objects. From inside my deck doors I know have many pictures of a deck railing in focus an out of focus deer in yard. Also from car I have an in focus guardrail and out of focus bear with cubs in field. There is a work around for the focus issue that takes only a few seconds but sometimes you just dont have the time to push shutter half way and make sure it focuses on main subject; mountain setting should not need to find subject to focus."^3^Jan 21, 2018 6:54 PM

I already have a DSLR and wanted to use this a on the go camera for photos, but mostly for videos. Very light weight and simple to use. The zoom makes a lot of noise and is slow when recording. Focus can take some time before it fully focuses on subject. Great photo quality and video is at 720 not 1080. If it is, never found out how to change it (and I'm used to changing the quality formats on several devices). 

Good for your money if you just need to a small simple camera for quick shots. Fits easily in your pocket and in your hand. Would recommend for buying a camera for someone needing a camera to take on vacation or what not for a great price.

I played around and managed to find the settings I wanted but am sure it does way more if I would take the time to learn about it.

Everything else is very good about the camera however, takes nice pictures, a little better than my older A3100IS Canon.

Fits nicely in her purse or pocket. 10x optical zoom. I like that it comes with a separate battery charger. A lot of cameras these days do not. With the separate charger, you can be taking pictures while a second battery is charging. The reason for only 4 stars is that we really haven't taken that many pictures under different conditions, so I am not sure about the picture quality under different conditions."^4^Jun 22, 2018 5:54 PM

While the megapixels may be same as a smartphone camera, this one has faster speed than most phones. The result is more photos in focus, especially when taking photos of kids who don't sit still. The auto settings are also great for quick adjustments to low-light or other preset formats. Zoom feature is great and doesn't result in grainy photos.

The shake in videos is jarring. This camera is comparable to something that would have been released in the very early 2000's. I purchased this for the carefree simplicity for on the go fun however it's literally unusable if you have any desire to enjoy your memories. I'd recommend purchasing the HTC re from 2014 even though it's five years old and most likely difficult to find. Do some research and you'll see that the re far surpasses the IVY REC which is mind-blowingly shocking as it's 2019 and we're talking about a camera from Canon. Do your research, this is a 100% unbiased review (I've never previously reviewed a product) but I've been so burned by this I just had to air my disbelief. I guarantee this will be pulled from shelves or never to be seen again after these initial units are severely discounted and sold."^1^Oct 21, 2019 3:22 PM

KLC7^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-stone/6367050?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this free IVY REC Outdoor Camera (Riptide) to review. I found it to be a great little camera, unbelievably small for all that it can do! I was able to take clear crisp photos as good if not better than my smartphone camera. 
     What I also found surprising was even though it is advertised as an outdoor camera, it takes great pictures indoors too. There is no flash feature for indoors, but as long as there is light in the room, pictures come out great. 
    The video option is doable. Not necessarily the best but it does what it says and for those moments when a short video is needed, it is fine. I like the fact that it can all be downloaded to your phone or computer later.
    I think this little camera is marketed for younger people for it's usability to travel and rugged exterior. I took photos in the rain without worry. If dropped, it can withstand the pressure. The camera itself has an attachable clip which makes it easy to carry; I clipped mine on my purse strap. 
   The only drawback I personally had with the camera is trying to open the little door for inserting the  MicroSD card and the cord for the USB port to download and charge. My husband had no problem opening it but I simply couldn't manage it. Perhaps not the best feature if you are older, have arthritis or other issues with strength.
    I would recommend this product especially for children when they want a camera of their own but might drop an expensive smartphone when taking a picture."^4^Dec 3, 2019 1:20 PM
Bev31^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-stone/6367050?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this camera fot free in exchange for a review. I like the simplicity of the design overall to make it more 'point and shoot.' The wheel on the back to choose the shooting mode is very easy to use, but does require using a fingernail or something similar so I don't believe it could be turned on by accident. There is no option to review pictures, or to really see the picture before you take it, so how good the picture turns out is based either on luck or by practice. The clip is very nice, and allows the camera to easily be attached to a belt loop for easy access. The accompanying app requires little set up, but after that is pretty easy to use. The app let's you see the photos or videos you've taken and then download them to use elsewhere. I don't appreciate that the app is mandatory in order to have full use of the camera, but I understand that it is part of streamlining the experience so I accept it. Overall it is a nice simple camera for on the go, and it would be nice for people who just want to be able to take quick pictures but aren't worried about professional quality."^4^Dec 3, 2019 12:04 PM
satisfied1^/sony-dsc-h300-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4076008?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^96^11^"Respectfully disagree with the negativity of the previous reviewers. Purchased this product having thoroughly researched and thought about what features were of top importance. The combination of such a high megapixels number and zoom ability is currently rare for this product's price topped everything. Before and after purchase, used every feature this product has to offer the user to make sure it worked properly and meet or exceed needs. If it didn't, was prepared to return it but that was not an issue or necessary. Quite the opposite. Very satisfied. There is even an Easy mode / setting built into the camera that you can set it to and just aim, adjust the framing of the shot and click the shutter. If you don't want to use this setting, just turn it off and take the time to at least learn to totally use the camera. As with any product, you may have to learn by experimenting with the features. If you want to immediately use it on a vacation, such as a previous user mentioned they did, of course things may not go perfectly because there might be a slight learning curve until being able to operate it exactly as you wish. To blame the camera for not doing something, like focusing, without being totally familiar with the inner workings and subtleties and precisely to properly adjust the settings seems unfair for this model. You must realize the level of features, including advanced, you have here. It's like if someone drives a regular every day street car but has never driven a more advanced car. It may be possible to operate some of the features but not others. People should not be so quick to criticize this product. You have to know, as a consumer, what you are committing to purchase before do so. Educate yourself as to what is important before purchasing. Even spend some time in the store touching it and hands on using every feature. It might be beneficial. For what it has to offer the user, the price is great! Totally happy with it!"^5^Apr 2, 2014 1:16 AM

In my opinion they continue to improve on their camera's and at the same time keep them affordable. I bought a similar camera from another brand with the same features for $150.00 more. It was shabby in comparison and I promptly sent it back. I consider myself an amateur photographer who just enjoys capturing those special memories of our family and grandchildren. Not to mention that I live in the mountains and have wildlife galore. This camera is amazing. It takes wonderful pictures , the zoom is quick and I haven't missed a moment or lost a shot yet. I'm having the best time learning and playing with my new camera. I only wish that it had a rechargeable lithium battery instead of 4 AA's. I did buy rechargeable AA's and a charger. But a regular digital camera battery would have been allot nicer. Other than that I truly cannot find one thing that I am disappointed it.

I will admit that I was a little skeptical about buying it based on some of the other reviewers comments, but I decided to purchase it anyway and I am very glad that I did. I love it! This is actually my first camera that I've ever bought, and I found it very easy to use right out of the box. I wanted to make the switch to a camera after importing my phone's pictures onto my laptop and realizing how grainy they looked. After doing the same with this camera, I can safely say that it takes wonderful clear photos! It has many different settings and options to choose from, and all are very easy to navigate through. Other reviewers have complained about the 'slow' auto focus and shutter speeds, but I find the speeds to be normal and it works great for me. If it was a more high end type of camera, then maybe I would understand the complaints but for the price of this camera, I think it was a very good deal. As a beginner camera, I highly recommend this camera to anyone who is interested!"^5^Jan 23, 2016 12:27 PM
Swipesy^/sony-dsc-h300-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4076008?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^36^10^"I bought the Sony DSC-H300 at Best Buy while on vacation in Washington D.C. I don't have a smart phone (just a little flip phone for emergencies), so I wanted to get something. I'm still getting used to the settings and such, but my initial impression, after 200+ photos, is that it's a huge step up from my previous camera (Sony DSC-P72), or any other camera I've ever had.

I went from 3.2 to 20.1 megapixels and the difference is astounding. So is going from 3x optical zoom to 35x! Photos are clear, image stabilization (not available on my old camera) is an extremely nice feature to have, and this new camera is almost as easy to use as my old one. I haven't tried the video recording feature yet, but I didn't buy it for that anyway. I bought it because I wanted something that could take very good photos, have more zoom that I had before, and didn't cost more than $250. I was looking for something with at least 10x zoom, then I saw this one with its 35x zoom. Needless to say, it caught my attention.

I read the reviews posted here and elsewhere before buying. There are good and bad reviews on just about everything out there, and I've learned to look at the overall picture (no pun intended) rather than place too much importance on bad reviews, though that's not so say I ignore them completely. Quite the contrary.

It's not perfect, of course, but for the price I paid I think it's a great bargain and has everything I want in a camera. It came with a set of four AA batteries, and those batteries lasted through all 200 photos and the time it took to download them to my computer. By comparison, my old camera ate batteries for breakfast.

I'm a happy camper with this camera. As an example, I've attached one of the photos I took with the camera. Due to the file limitations on this review, I did crop the photo and reduce the colors to reduce the file size, but the full-size photo look the same to me, and I have good eyes. The photo was taken from the Washington Monument, which is about 0.57 miles away line of sight. It was not taken at full zoom either.

Downloading photos is a breeze with the included USB cable. There's no WiFi, but that doesn't matter to me. I might try getting some rechargable batteries for it, but I haven't had much luck with rechargables in the past. Maybe they're better now?

I'm looking forward to taking more trips now, since I now have a camera that can take much better photos than I was able to before.

I don't normally give five stars on anything, but four seems a bit low too. I'd rate this camera at 4.5 stars.

I'm not a professional photographer, but I've won many contests and awards with my photos. This camera can take awesome pics in macro - or with the incredible zoom. The focusing is quick, the LCD screen can be moved to different positions to make it easier to see in bright light, and it has a viewfinder for those of us 'old school' photographers! Easy to use in any mode! I've taken many Ribbon Winning photos with this camera! The few issues I have with it is not with it's performance. The lens cap is useless, and is easy to fall off and get lost. It doesn't come with a printed manual. I'm not one to run to the computer every time I need to know something about the camera - so that is probably my biggest beef. And altho I don't take many flash pictures as I feel it gives things a 'fake' look, I have to say I don't like this flash at all. It almost always makes people look way over exposed. But this camera is so awesome in low light, you won't have to use flash very often. You can take a photo in such low light with unbelievable results - you'll be blown away! This is my 2nd Sony, and I'm sold! I have many film SLR's and a Canon DSLR, but this HX300 is my 'go to' camera! I wouldn't be without it!"^5^Apr 14, 2018 5:57 PM

Johabilus^/sony-dsc-h300-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4076008?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"This camera provides wonderful flexibility, high-quality photos, a 35x zoom and good, balanced handling all at a very reasonable price. I hike a lot. I use it primarily in macro mode, and I mount it on a walking stick (read 'monopod'). It has given me wonderful wildflower photos from the very first.

I'm often in rough terrain, so I frequently shut the camera down between brief bursts of photographing in order to protect the lens. Because of that I use a lot of battery power. But a battery change in the field is easy for this camera; you can do it one-handed. Even with all the 'on-off-on-off' I still get almost 200 photos from a set of fully charged NiM-hydride batteries.

I love it."^5^Feb 20, 2016 1:25 AM

It's a good size for someone with big, somewhat clumsy hands. I like that it comes with a neck-strap and has a 'simple' menu mode. It also has a lens cap that is attached to the camera, so it cannot be lost. My grandpa was able to take pictures, upload them to his computer, and e-mail them. The pictures he took are really sharp with good color. Another bonus is that is uses normal AA batteries, so when they drain out, replacing them is easy.

That said, there are some cons:

- The battery/SD card compartment cover is not easy to open/close and feels flimsy.
- It's not incredibly obvious which way the batteries are supposed to be oriented. There are markings in the battery slots, but it's very hard to read."^4^Sep 18, 2015 5:54 PM

I figured that if I lost the camera it wasn't a huge deal, but if I lost my phone that would be a major issue. The zoom is very good although you have to be quite steady to get a good picture, but the auto stable function helps a lot. There are a lot of settings to learn but mostly I use the automatic mode. My girlfriend is surprised at how good of a picture it takes and she's an amateur photographer. There are two things that I don't like a lot, one is I would prefer a manual focus option as this auto focus is slow or acts confused at times. The other thing is it takes four AA batteries, and it can chew through them if you are using it a lot so bring spares."^4^Mar 25, 2019 7:39 AM

On the plus side, this camera is relatively easy to use and takes great photos. But the cons far outweigh the negatives in this case. First and foremost, the battery life is awful. I have had this camera 2 months and gone through 3 sets of 4 batteries--and taken about 400 photos during that period. Using the zoom lens doesn't help here but this camera is a battery drainer. I have now had to purchase rechargeable batteries and the performance of this unit is even worse. And all of this connects with the second con about this camera which is that it weighs too much to lug around. Bottom line: if you're looking for a camera to take on vacations in particular, I would not recommend this one because of these two factors alone."^2^Nov 2, 2016 9:03 AM

If you are really dedicated to getting into photography then you might not give this one a second look, but if you're dipping your toes in the water this is a great camera to try things out.

While the lens is fixed in place, it means one less thing to try and have to learn about as you get started. Its also good as a grab and go as its ready to go right there.

The only reason I give this a 4 out of 5 is that you dont even have the option to be able to swap the lens, and it uses 4 AA batteries rather than something with a longer battery life."^4^Jan 16, 2015 4:26 PM

It takes too long to focus for the next picture (can't find what to focus on) so I miss the shot. It stinks at special effect shots (like shooting through an abbey window at a castle. The castle burned out-and it was an overcast day). Every time it started to sprinkle I was concerned about moisture and wouldn't take it.

But I was not totally happy with it once I started to use it. The digital zoom is over stated. It is effectively only 2X the optical zoom. The auto-focus is slow and the ability to change aperture and shutter speed is somewhat cumbersome. My other cameras are Canon and Nikon, so maybe I'm just not used to the way Sony presents its menu options. It also was not very good at taking pictures in low light. This camera is not a total loss. It comes with a glass lens - something almost never heard of at this price point. The ISO range is great and the exposure compensation is really good. At this price point, this is a very good camera, but I would prefer other brands for a few more dollars."^3^Jun 30, 2016 7:09 AM

mathewade77^/sony-dsc-h300-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4076008?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^14^23^"Bought this camera before heading on vacation to Costa Rica. Miss MANY great shots due to trying to focus, and 1/2 the time it NEVER did focus. Whether it was close or far, the camera took forever to focus. And again, many times it never did focus, so, I missed some really great shots of animal life (poison dart frogs, sloths, and others).
There was no Micro option, which may have made some of the closer pics better/more focused.
The shutter speed was also very slow, so, it made me miss several pictures due to this as well.
As it states it the title, 'You get what you pay for.' The price seemed right, but it is not worth it.
Also, I thought in the description it stated, 'Battery included.' Yes, there were FOUR batteries, not rechargeable. Another major flaw, as you have to bring MANY extra batteries, which loads you down.
Also, night pictures were very bad. I tried using the 'Scene' Night feature with and without flash, tried 'SImple' feature with and without feature. None of them turned out well."^1^Mar 16, 2014 4:17 PM

I was full of excitement, anticipating the great photos I would take. Well, I was heavily disappointed by everything about this camera. Its like a junky play toy, dressed up as a real camera. I can testify that any cell phone camera I've ever had takes better pictures than this thing. Every time I took a picture, a bright orange light came on and could not be turned off. Also the flash is blindingly bright and can't be turned off. I searched the options numerous times and read online tech articles. No dice. Every one of my subjects would refuse to participate in the photo and complained of their eyes seeing spots. Then when I looked at the photos, everything had an orange tint, and looking towards a light made blue streaks like sun rays. Awful awful awful! It made everything I photographed look very unattractive. Meanwhile, I consider myself to be a passionate amateur digital photographer, and I love playing with this medium, creating art, collages and zines. This camera does not even have the option of black and white or sepia. I swear, it sucks in every way. Please save your money and get a nice cell phone camera. Mine is an LG Stylo 2, and the front camera is 15 megapixels, the rear is 8 megapixels. This camera says 20 megapixels, but it takes very low quality photos."^1^Mar 23, 2018 5:38 PM

Parkersspace^/fujifilm-finepix-xp140-16-4-megapixel-waterproof-digital-camera-sky-blue/6333186?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"Previously on vacation I would buy those waterproof throw away fuji film cameras, pay 25$ for the cameras, pay to develop the photos and get what came out.  It is very difficult to view anything underwater on any small camera, so you kind of point it and hope.  I did get used to viewing the screen through my goggles and could at least make out a large rocks or a shell I would aim for with lots of fish or coral near it.  I could then zoom, focus and shoot.  I am a semi professional photographer but not underwater.  The quality of the photo when taken in highest quality and largest size, though the camera over processes like all point and shoots, when edited to clear haze and shrunk to a 2500px longest side was great and hid most over processing artifacts created by the camera. It did a colour reproduction in and out of water but it is not my professional DSLR.  For the money it was awesome.  Fun and easy to use.  I quickly learned the set up and appreciated being able to adjust the white balance and have jpg's with a high enough quality and size to edit. I snorkeled two days for 4 hours each day, had the camera under water the full time and 0 issues, it worked flawlessly and much better than the throw away i would normally use.  It will pay for itself in 4 snorkeling days.  Attaching photos, they have been edited to remove haze and to my liking.  The wonderful thing about the camera is i can take photos, throw away those that don't work without paying to develop them and keep what i want, and edit them to my liking, unlike the film throw aways."^4^Nov 4, 2019 9:03 AM

It always ranked in the top 5 of underwater cameras. I used if for snorkeling and ran into several big issues, the main problem was the camera would take a long time to focus or not focus at all. When you would zoom the problem got worse. The other problem was 'bubbles' on all video or photos. Not sure if water got in between the lens and waterproof glass or condensation. The final issue was the glare on the screen while snorkeling, it made it almost impossible to see what you were shooting. Oh, one more thing. While taking a video when you would zoom you could here the motor noise in your playback. No good. I bet I deleted 80 - 90% of photos and videos. Lucky we brought our GoPro Hero 7 black on the trip.

  - Easy to use 

Cons: 
  - The screen is not visible when wearing polarized sunglasses

First thing I noticed is this camera eats up battery power if you leave the Bluetooth feature turned on (which allows you to sync the photos to you phone or tablet via the app which is way cool IMO).

Photogenie7^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-vii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6364719?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"I am totally amazed at this camera. The picture quality is excellent as is the quick and accurate focusing. The low light performance is excellent too. I was skeptical to buy this camera and considered the Sony RX100 VA as it has a faster lens but I wanted the longer zoom and touch focus. The V7 has performed wonderfully in all lighting conditions. The lens is still fast  enough for me as I got great night shots, focused, clear, sharp. I did a few selfies and the photo was sharp as could be with excellent color. The features rival the Sony DSLR. Best Buy did price match so I saved a considerable amount of money which was one reason I bought the camera as I did not want to spend 1200 Dollars on a camera. After using this camera I can tell you it is worth  the price. Best camera out there. Since I saved so much money on the camera I bought an extended warranty, fitted case and extra batteries. Great accessories if you buy the camera. I know that Best Buy will fix or replace the camera if anything goes wrong for 3 years. Extra batteries are a necessity. The case protects the camera. There are two different styles of cases but I am not sure if Best Buy carries both. You can get it at a well known photo retailer in New York City. However, Best Buy carries a very popular fitted case and excellent Sony case. 
I took photos in total darkness with the flash and the the photo quality was excellent. The camera focused accurate with correct exposure. Most camera would have a difficult time focusing in total darkness without a light assist. Not this camera. Read all about the features of this camera and you will see it is in a class of its own. I highly recommended this camera. You will not regret buying it."^5^Feb 20, 2020 9:27 PM

Granted both are premium but different price categories still the auto focus on this is well worth the price difference and the quality of the menus feels like a pro would easily enjoy with so much customization its nonstop of potential. When I invested in this for Our Micro Family vlog I thought noway would this be amazing but it really grabbed me and proved me wrong. The thing that I love most is that I have power of a 24 mm lens and all way out to a 200 mm zoom which is great. The 4k recording does not overheat after five minutes but instead around 30 minutes which is nice. 
Now onto the bad side, there is no wall charger in the box and that is a 49 dollar optional addon.

The pictures are amazingly sharp and I used the 200mm zoom quite a bit.  The Sony was able to focus and take a clear picture even though our tour bus was in motion.  When we visited a National Park, we were extremely lucky and saw a tiger appear briefly from the bushes,  I was the only one on my vehicle that captured the whole body of the tiger.  The other people with smart phones and slower cameras got only half the body or tail before the tiger disappeared in the bushes.

GEO1^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-vii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/6364719?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^6^"This is an expensive point-and-shoot.  It was much anticipated.  There will likey be an rx 100 viii next summer.  I'm sure the new iphone 11 pro can take similar quality photos.  This camera is likely best for vloggers.  The tilt screen works great for this and selfies.  The video quality is great, very little shake.  The sound is also good.  You can record in slow motion and time lapse directly in the camera.  These feature are fairly easy to use but you won't likely use them much.  Stills had good resolution and the autofocus was on spot most of the time.  Eye detect AF doesn't always stick to the eyes.  There is also eye AF for video.  It shoots a high amount of frames per second (90 fps?).  The focus on the subject is not as sharp as I expected at high frame rates.   The optical zoom is 8x and gets you close enough for shooting sports action from the stands.  The Sony app this camera connects to works great to send pictures and videos directly to the cellphone and television.  This camera is a good fit for someone who wants a versatile camera on the go without having to carry a mirrorless, lenses or flash.  I couldn't find a dedicated travel case for this camera.  It is quite small and definitely does not belong in your pockets.  If you want higher resolution pictures you'll need a bigger sensor and camera!  So if you're fine with above average quality pictures and video from a point-and-shoot, use this camera in Auto mode and it will work great.  Sony has the best autofocus on the market hands down.  I did not keep this camera, I found the a7riii was a better fit for me."^4^Oct 9, 2019 10:30 PM
sumofan^/sony-cyber-shot-rx10-iv-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera/6111512?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^0^"This is my fourth camera in the SONY RX line. I started with the initial RX10. As SONY introduced the next iterations, there were notable improvements. The RX-10iii was an excellent camera in particular: fast lens, great range. But, with the introduction of the RX-10iv, SONY made it impossible for me to not move on. Same superb 24x600 mm ZEISS lens, 20 megapixel 1' sensor, recent modification removed the slight delay when shooting moving objects such as birds or planes. This is a Point and Shoot camera (meaning the lens is permanently fixed to the body ... unlike DSLRs, which have removable lenses. It has a wealth of controls, but also takes absolutely superb pictures in AUTO mode - for those wanting to get right down to just plain getting great shots without wrangling with manual settings. The camera itself has the heft and feel of a DSLR and, with that 600 mm range and low light capability of that very impressive Carl Zeiss lens, I offer the suggestion that this camera would fit the needs and desires of very many budding photographers. Additionally, this one camera replaces a bag full of heavy/expensive lenses. You'd have to have had to lug heavy camera bags housing a DSLR and an array of lenses to appreciate this previous sentence! :-) I have tried many cameras (including DSLRs and expensive lenses), but have always returned to the SONY RX-10 line. The pictures I've taken, per my subjective viewpoint, are excellent. What else is there? Go into Best Buy, the folks at the Camera section will be more than happy to let you try one in the store (no, not getting any AttaBoys for this!)."^5^Feb 23, 2018 4:53 PM

Big difference in my opinion regarding focus speed and focus tracking. Was it worth it to me - yes. I have seen better focusing in low light and catching my moving grandkids in focus. Both cameras have excellent photo images. If you plan on outdoor pictures, nature photography, etc, then I would stick with the RX10 III, since it will focus plenty fast in those situations. If you plan of focusing fast moving objects or low light situations, I would go for the RX10 IV."^5^Nov 24, 2017 4:21 PM
MandarinDuck^/sony-cyber-shot-rx10-iv-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera/6111512?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^11^0^"I had the original APS-C sensor 2005 Sony bridge camera, DSC-R1, as my first digital camera which was extraordinary for its time. I then upgraded to Sony's 1' sensor bridge camera DSC-RX10 (mark I) which was lighter in weight and extended the zoom to a 24-200 mm equivalent. I loved this camera but its limitation in telephoto range prevented great wildlife and bird photography as well as its slow focus in certain situations had me eagerly awaiting this Mark IV. This camera extends the zoom to 600 mm telephoto for wildlife and birds.while the phase detection focusing solves the slow focusing problems with the preceding Mark I, II and II versions of the RX10. It is hard to imagine a version which would lead me to upgrade again. The only way to replace this camera with a DSLR or mirrorless would require a large camera bag full of lenses. For active travel, the RX10 Mark IV is perfect and solves the shortcomings of other bridge cameras."^5^Nov 11, 2017 8:33 AM
jjsereday^/sony-cyber-shot-rx10-iv-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera/6111512?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^9^0^"Sony's RX10 is an incredibly capable camera. As a professional I never thought I would purchase a bridge camera but the ability to capture 4K video on a 24-600mm F4 lens is something that I couldn't pass up. 
I use this camera as a 3rd camera next to the Sony a7Sii or a7Rii. It has Slog which can be graded to match color nicely and just able all of the camera settings and capabilities as the a7 series.
For photos the IV added higher and longer FPS which is great for sports or any fast passed action that needs speed and great autofocus.And doing so at 600mm is unreal.
Definitely check it out. It is one of the most versatile camera on the market and for under $2k it's definitely worth it."^5^Nov 22, 2017 12:33 PM
Doc100^/sony-cyber-shot-rx10-iv-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera/6111512?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"This is a professional quality camera with two major benefits not seen in any of its competitor products: 1) it has Sony's best autofocus system and 2) it has the longest zoom range of any camera of this type except for one model from Nikon which is inferior in every respect.

1. Autofocus. You will want to use the 'center lock-on AF' option whenever you have a moving subject. This causes the camera to dynamically focus on your intended object even if it moves in the frame and even if it temporarily moves OUT of the frame and then back in. If you are trying to photograph moving objects (children, animals) this feature is a game-changer. It even works BOTH for movies and still shots. No camera manufacturer has autofocus as good as Sony. This camera can focus in 0.03 seconds without the 'hunting' seen in contrast-detection autofocus systems.

2. The lens. This lens is nothing short of spectacular. You can get reasonable wide angle shots and stunning telephoto shots without changing lenses. The goal of all photography is to 'get the shot' which is more difficult if you have to fumble to change the lens when you need either a wider or more telephoto shot. You don't need to do that with this camera due to the incredible lens range. This lens is also tack sharp at all focal lengths. To get comparable-quality lenses for an interchangeable lens camera you would have to spend at least $2000 for each of at least 2 lenses!

Some have suggested that the sensor on this camera is too small for low light work. I can tell you I sold a micro 4/3 camera which a sensor about twice as large as the 1 inch sensor in this camera, and this camera takes better pictures, including in low light.

The price is high on this camera; no other camera manufacturer makes a 'point and shoot' camera this expensive, but as in all other areas in life, you get what you pay for. This is the kind of camera one would want to buy and use for literally everything for years.

ENTER the RX10 IV: I no longer have to switch lenses. The built in zoom lens is *sharp* even at the 600mm end! The phase detection auto focus is fast and accurate just like the advertisement says. And the built in image stabilization works great too.

In regards to recording in 4K, I've had NO problems with overheating, which unfortunately happens with the a6500 every now and then.

The only things that I'd like to see improvement in a future RX10 V would be:

(1) No 4K video at 60fps
(2) I wish it had at least 24MP of resolution
(3) No built in neutral density filters
(4) No way to reprogram the zoom ring to simply do nothing. (I sometimes bump the darn thing every now and then when I'm using the manual focus ring)
(5) Dual memory card slots. Let's face it, some of us will be using this camera in semi critical/critical applications. Having backup memory is important.

I liked how the zoom has good reach, and the fact that it produces raw files was a plus for me since I like to make adjustments afterwards. The picture shown is after using Cyberlink's PhotoDirector (similar to Lightroom) to pull out more details, which is a great aspect of having RAW files.

For my wife, she wanted the zoom, and is thrilled with the picture quality. If you need more low light, go Sony, but realize your shots will hardly looked zoomed in. Note also that the Panasonic has a really low f stop, great for isolating your subject, but not so great when you want an f16 with lots of depth of field.

This did reach my expectations with picture quality and portability (fits in my coat pocket nicely). 
A bit too costly for a point and shoot - more than some of the DSLRs in market. But the only other point and shoot camera that can match it in specifications of this product line is Sony RX series which is way more costlier. Its auto-focus is nice but slower than competitors (My friend has an RX100 Mark IV). Its packing is cheap for a 650$ product, it doesn't matter since you are not going to use that box anyway. But, you might feel that you got a duplicate product looking at its packaging.

Its 10 X Zoom is stable and thanks to its 1 inch sensor, night shots are very good (nearly the best - but you can use the built in night modes to get a great night picture). The picture quality is standard (do not expect it to be like a DSLR, they have a more controlled focus and bokeh effect). The most important and the the main function is its 4K modes (video, burst shoot) - this is fantastic, especially with the 5-axis image stabilization. The Post Focus is not really what is expected to be. The battery has a fair performance, depending on what is used more - video/still-photos/4k Burst etc., I did not like the view finder, reason for it being an electronic - but I knew this before I bought it. There is no screen articulation, which I do not need - I am not using it for v-logging or a fan of selfies. I mostly use it for landscape or random still life photography. The camera has a WiFi to mobile communication via app - This is amazing for this generation making your life easier, you can just transfer the pics and even take pictures remotely without touching the camera. If you are looking for a nice travel camera that fits in your palm and which can quickly capture good images, this is best in the line (only rival being Sony Rx series, other do not even match). It has several other features, which I tested and can go on writing about them - that is for you when you buy one. Happy clicking."^5^Nov 20, 2017 11:20 AM

It has a nice 10x zoom, and a relatively fast lens at the wide end. There is complete manual control, and more features that even an enthusiast is likely to use. The image quality ranges from acceptable at the telephoto end wide open, to very good at the mid to shorter focal lengths with the lens stopped down a little bit. But the convenience of having a decent length of zoom lens makes it worth the slight trade off in image quality at the longer focal lengths, especially considering the small size of the camera.
But what I am really impressed with is the 4K video quality, both at 24 and 30 frames per second. There are also a number of features and controls you can use while shooting video. And the video quality doesn't seem to suffer at the longer focal lengths like the photo image quality does. Overall, I think a novice to intermediate level photographer will be very satisfied with this camera. Throw in the excellent video, and compact form factor, and this is a definite winner.
I had considered the newer version of this camera, which has an even longer zoom range, but the lens was a little bit slower and I didn't think that would be as useful for the kind of photography I do. Plus I shoot a number of micro four-thirds cameras when I really need top notch stills and or 4k video quality.
From an overall enthusiasts perspective it earns four stars, but for an overall camera for a beginner or intermediate level photographer this is definitely a five-star camera."^4^Jul 8, 2018 8:40 PM

This hit the spot. The 20x zoom was used a lot more than I thought, and the larger sensor delivered better low light photos and other benefits. The size was very reasonable considering the zoom capabilities of the camera. 

There are an incredible number of features built into this camera. Many more than I could master prior to the trip, unfortunately, One that did come in handy was the 4K snapshot mode, which was perfect for capturing the perfectly timed shot for sporting events.

Pros- large sensor, small size, good zoom range, extensive features. Decent battery life.

Minuses- no built in geo-tagging. No manual focusing, and auto-focusing seemed slow at times- or else I didn't choose the right mode.

However, unless you're pixel peeping, you probably won't notice it. The lens is also a little bit slower than a lot of other 1' cameras, because it has such a long zoom range. Overall I think it is worth the trade-off. It has great manual controls, is fairly straightforward to work with, and the touchscreen is fantastic. This is a great all-in-one camera to take on a trip, if you don't want to bring your larger interchangeable lens camera with you.
Any recent overseas trip, I took an Olympus e-m1 Mark II with several lenses, the Canon g7x enthusiast camera, and this. I took the overwhelming majority of pictures with this camera. In camera raw processing is very nice also.
The overall video features and quality are outstanding on the camera, lots of customization available on the video.
I would actually recommend this camera over the newer version, because although the zoom range is longer on the new version, the lens is a little bit better quality on this one, and the apertures are faster. Plus being an older model it's less expensive.
If you are looking for the ultimate in image quality in a pocketable camera, get the Sony RX100 mk 6. But you'll pay three times more for it."^5^Apr 13, 2019 2:26 PM

Finally got tired of inferior mobile phone photos so decided to pick up a bridge camera that can fit in my pocket and produces decent quality images. Researched the current line of advanced point & shoots and settled on the ZS100 because image quality appears comparable to the others and it has a 10x zoom, which makes it more versatile.

Obviously image quality of a 1' sensor is not up to full frame standards, but I've found it much better than my mobile phone and unless I pixel peep, can produce images that are very acceptable.

The biggest benefit I've found is that it has expanded my ability to be creative and capture images that I wouldn't have taken before. Generally I use a tripod with my DSLR, which takes time to set up. The ZS100 allows me to shoot quickly and hand-hold shots from various angles with surprisingly good results.

The only negative I feel is the difficulty in controlling ISO, aperture and shutter speed. Maybe its just a matter of getting used to the controls, but I would have preferred separate controls like what's offered with the LX100. I was very tempted to get the LX100 except for the slightly larger size and limited zoom range.

All in all, I'm pleased with the ZS100 and look forward to using it as my casual go-to camera."^4^May 5, 2017 7:32 PM

The ZS 8 was 14.1 megapixel, 16X zoom. 
I enjoyed the ZS 8, but recently the zoom function has not always worked. I thought this would be great replacement because of the longer zoom, higher resolution, and view finder in addition to the lcd back screen.
After working with the ZS100, in a variety of shooting situations, I decided that it was not the camera for me, for the following reasons: 1) the viewfinder was really difficult to use wearing glasses. If I removed my glasses, then I couldn't see the adjustments made with the diopter. 2) Unlike the most recent edition of the ZS cameras, this one had no texture at the points where you hold the camera. It is a smooth surface. This made it difficult for me to grasp the camera securely while trying to make adjustments. 3) I shot comparison images with the ZS8, IPhone 7 and ZS100. I did not see a significant improvement in image quality.
I returned the ZS100 and purchased a Sony HX400V. It is a substantially larger camera, a bridge camera. It also has a fixed lense with a 50X optical zoom, A tiltable 3' rear screen, an optical view finder, and better gripping surfaces. An additional bonus for me is that I also own a Sony A58 SLT, that has very similar controls and functions."^3^Feb 6, 2019 10:56 AM

LowerEastSider^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/5298501?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^57^3^"I looked at much more expensive cameras but settled on this one because it generally had good reviews and was just small enough to fit into a pocket.

I did not want to spend a lot of money on something that could get damaged, dropped or stolen.

The picture quality is above average without a lot of graininess or artifacts. Even when zoomed-in to a reasonable level on a large screen monitor, most photos look very detailed. And, the colors are quite pleasing and natural looking.

It is best at taking still photos. That being said, when I set the camera in burst mode, I was able to get some decent shots at a recent bike race. But there are better cameras with faster lenses if you plan on taking a lot of action shots.

The 'P' mode offers some controls for things like exposure level and white balance. But this is a camera designed primarily for automatic use. There is no function dial, so you must go into the menus to make changes to the settings.

The camera does a better than average job of taking good photos using the auto mode. And, even in the program mode, it still operates mostly automatically.

The 25X zoom range is certainly more than adequate for most users.

This is not one of those cameras that amazes you with it's shot to shot speed. But for most people it is more than adequate.

You will not feel like you have a 'brick' in your pocket or purse with this camera. It is quite lightweight and not too long or wide. The next most expensive Cannon model offers better performance, but it is (in my opinion) simply too large and heavy to tuck in a pocket.

I bought a small canvas case that I hook to my belt. This keeps the camera protected and it is always ready for use.

This camera is a good value for someone who is not a 'camera person' but wants pleasing, lifelike photos. You could spend additional money and get more features, but not necessarily better quality photos."^4^Jul 2, 2018 7:26 PM

BattyFoto^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/5298501?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^26^8^"First let me say this. This camera is nice and good for this price range, which is why it has 4 stars and I would recommend it....
 If you can get past the following points...
**Please note though, the whole purpose of this purchase was for a higher megapixel camera that could give me crisp macro (close up) photos of my artwork. 

That being said, here's my opinion:
1. This camera is tiny! Think almost flip phone size, which makes it very awkward and hard to grip right with average adult hands.
2. Very impressive zoom photos. I used it to take exterior detail photos for an insurance claim. When I took 2nd floor photos of the details around windows, you would have thought they were first floor! So it did what I needed it to there.
3. No cords come with it. You take the battery out to charge it using a plug in adapter. 
4. I ended up not being able to get it to connect to my laptop at all, so I just took the memory card out each time. This was a let down.
5. Cannon menus are a bit confusing to me. My son has a T5, which I tried to use a few times before and couldn't get the hang of things. Beginners be careful and really read the manual and try how to videos online.
6. There's a clicking noise it makes. It's the small metal pieces making up the lense protector. So when it's closed/off, for some reason mine made noises when I moved it around. Just an annoyance.
7. Okay here's the main reason I took it back. The closer shots were not as impressive as I expected per the many reviews saying it's good for that. I'm sure it's better than average though. However, in my case, I need really detailed photos of my artwork to be able to make prints of good quality. This did not deliver. Now, I might have been expecting way too much for a $200 range camera, but I was just going by other's opinions. 
So there ya go. This is just MY humble opinion also lol.
I would call myself a hobbiest photographer. Not an expert, but more than a beginner.
Thank you!"^4^Aug 9, 2018 7:24 AM

TexasFlyer^/canon-powershot-sx620-hs-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/5298501?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^2^"I'm glad I bought it but it has a few issues. The battery did not last very long and stopped charging after one charge. It told me it wasn't a real Canon battery. That was problematic because I bought it just prior to going on vacation to have a better camera than my IPhone 7. I found two aftermarket batteries and a car charger on the road and they worked so well, I really only needed one. It is a much better camera, than the IPhone 7, but my biggest disappointment was my inability to get decent photos of the stars and moon in the desert sky. I tried every setting for hours and hours. Vibrant is a little too 'vibrant' It will take a woman's face from 'discreet' to saloon hooker. LOL. The Zoom feature was the best part. For my taste, it has a few too many artsy settings to throw fairy dust on your photo but I guess to each his own. I guess the sad part is that I will probably need to run all my vacation photos--- (600) through a photo app or software before I post them. But they are good photos to start with. But my wife just bout an IPhone 8 and it takes a better standard picture than this camera if you don't need zoom and 20mp density photos. The other nice thing is that adding another 600 photos to my IPhone might start giving me memory issues, at least with cloud back up. So I am glad I bought it, but will use it for the zoom feature in the outdoors mostly."^4^Nov 25, 2017 4:25 AM

I was shocked at first. I have arthritis and I was afraid it would be difficult to hold, but it wasn't. I'm an amateur with cameras. I didn't read the manual before using it on a recent vacation, yet it was user friendly for taking basic photos. 

The battery is a chargeable battery. It doesn't come charged out of the box, so be prepared to have time to charge it. (I learned the hard way - I took it on vacation still in the box.) Also, it is a USB charger. I tried to use it via my cell phone wall adapter, but it didn't work. I had to charge it via my laptop. 

One difference is my old one had view finder to look through and a screen - this one only has a screen. I keep forgetting - annoying! Another difference is the pop-up flash. It helps me remember it's on. One disadvantage is the buttons are small - tiny really - hard for me to read. You have to purchase a memory card separately."^5^Jun 7, 2017 8:19 PM

To power the camera up, you have to try and push the little power button on top. I had to use my finger nail to push the recessed button down.

They eliminated the auto flash like the older model had. So if you are taking pictures and the sensors decide you need a flash, you leave your shot, twist the camera sideways to find the little slide button then you raise the flash by using your fingernail to push the tiny little recessed button on the left side.to pop the flash up. Then you go back to your shot.

The other buttons on the screen side are close together and recessed. You have to be right on to push them or you will push the wrong one. The dial around the Func set button is small and when you attempt to push on the outside ring, there's a good chance you will also hit the func set button that you didn't want to push. There are 4 buttons around that dial that are also recessed and close together. Not easy to use.

The door on the right side which you open to get to the HDMI cable hook ups is held by two little plastic strips which I have a feeling would not last that long.

Well, this camera does not. I ordered one on Amazon for $5. How am I suppose to transfer photos if I am at someone's home or a location when wifi or removing the memory card is not an option? You will need the cable. 
The free memory card is to small to be practical. The SanDisk Extreme PRO 128GB SDXC is not stocked at the BB store. Available for half the price at Amazon. That is the best card for this camera. (the micro card is to slow). BB would not give credit toward a better memory card. The free card is a wasted product.
Finally, no storage or travel case. 
So, after you buy this camera you need a transfer cable, better memory card and travel/purse case. I would not give this as a gift because it is not a complete package. More a fault of Canon than BB. What's next? Charging extra for a battery charger? 
I don't like the pop-up flash. That is obsolescence engineered into the camera.

I wanted a genuinely pocket-sized camera that could pack a punch, and boy does this little thing rise to occasion.

I knew it would have stellar photo quality because it uses, pretty much, the same sensor as the G7x and G5x series, which are incredible advanced compacts. What I didn't expect was just how small the G9x Mk II was going to be when I took it out of the box... This thing is TINY. And for the past month the photos and videos I've taken with it have pretty evenly matched those from the G7x and G5x I've used in the past.

There are 2 (minor) downsides to the G9x though. The first being the lack of a flip or articulating display. And the second is the fact that you cannot record in 60fps when in auto mode, you actually have to switch the dial to movie mode and set 60p as your desired recording frame rate.

At full price ($529) the camera is a bit overreaching. But at it's now pretty common $429 price it's a no-brainer to add to your camera arsenal."^5^Jun 2, 2017 5:43 PM

InlandPNWShooter^/canon-powershot-g9-x-mark-ii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5715504?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"This camera is currently available for $399 USD, which makes it hands down the best value in compact cameras right now. Sometimes I don't want to pack along my bigger Fuji system with multiple lenses, so I just bring this along instead. It doesn't disappoint. JPEG images look great straight out of the camera. Or, if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and messing with a RAW file, you've got that option as well. Take some time to dig through the menus to see what options are available to you. The in-camera HDR processor is surprisingly effective. I also use the time lapse video feature as well. Images are reasonably sharp, probably more than I would expect in a camera like this. And certainly more than sharp enough for web use. 

Physically, it's small and somewhat weighty due to its metal construction. It just feels sturdy.  Power up is quick; just the amount of time it takes for the lens to extend out of its housing. I've used the Canon phone app to transfer photos to my Android device, and it works like a champ. 

Just know what this camera is good for. You'll get nice shots of your kids indoor birthday party, but probably not of their indoor sports. You don't get much reach with the lens, so you might want to move up to the G7XmkII if you need longer zoom. I'm finding that it's great for travel/nature/landscape work, and an occasional street scene that I might come across. 

If you just choose this as your only stand-alone camera, I think you're making a good choice. Take some time to learn it and to understand what it can and can't do, and you should get years of great images."^5^Jun 26, 2019 6:22 PM

My only complaint is the charging system, which requires you to take the battery out and plug it into the proprietary battery charging system. I had thought that you could use the usb data cable and plug it in to charge, but that will not work. This requires you to bring that additional accessory along with you or have multiple batteries, which usually isn't too big of a deal. Aside from that one issue, this item is definitely a good purchase. There are relatively few point and shoot cameras in this price range that also boast the 20 megapixel resolution that this does. -- This review allows only for photos to be uploaded with 5 mb or less of image size and the majority of the images that I have shot with this range between 7 mb and 12 mb, so I found 2 photos that were under this file size that were shot with the camera. They are definitely not the best ones that were shot, but may help. These were literally the only 2 I had that were under or equal to 5 mb."^4^Jul 10, 2016 11:35 AM

This camera has some lag, resulting in missed action shots. But it is compact and lightweight and easy to travel with, which is why I bought it. And, the price was great.
Battery life is limited - you will need a second battery if you are going to take many pictures (50 or more) on one charge.
Setting up the software for external communication is NOT USER FRIENDLY. I ended up going to Google for further explanations. In the end I can use my cellphone as a control device. Great, but so what?

The only thing I did not like was it did not have a panoramic shot setting!! I like to take photos of nature and things so it was something I really wished it had. It was quick to shoot photos and adjusted well but I really couldn't live without panoramic shots so that's why I couldn't stay with just this one.

Most of the time in Auto mode most of the features seem to work just fine. It finds faces, focuses, and tracks them well. Changes to Macro for close ups. White balance under different lights keep whites white.
The WiFi has not connected. Have tried twice about a half hour each time before giving up. The memory card fits slot on computer and that works just fine.
My old camera has a dial to set basic Program settings; mountain, portrait, low light, fireworks, vivd color, etc This camera you have to use the screen and function button and then up, down, left, or right function to get to common program modes. Some settings are saved so with one button push you can get back to last setting, others are reset back to factory.
My issue is the mountain program setting which I use very often. First, it is not saved and you have to go thru about five button pushes to reset it. Second, the focus is not locked at infinity, its range is from 9 feet to infinity. Which means it keeps focusing on near objects. From inside my deck doors I know have many pictures of a deck railing in focus an out of focus deer in yard. Also from car I have an in focus guardrail and out of focus bear with cubs in field. There is a work around for the focus issue that takes only a few seconds but sometimes you just dont have the time to push shutter half way and make sure it focuses on main subject; mountain setting should not need to find subject to focus."^3^Jan 21, 2018 6:54 PM

I already have a DSLR and wanted to use this a on the go camera for photos, but mostly for videos. Very light weight and simple to use. The zoom makes a lot of noise and is slow when recording. Focus can take some time before it fully focuses on subject. Great photo quality and video is at 720 not 1080. If it is, never found out how to change it (and I'm used to changing the quality formats on several devices). 

Good for your money if you just need to a small simple camera for quick shots. Fits easily in your pocket and in your hand. Would recommend for buying a camera for someone needing a camera to take on vacation or what not for a great price. But personally I would not recommend if they can afford something more higher quality.

It is smaller and lighter than the camera I cant find at the moment which I enjoyed but its features are a little harder to access because they are somewhat buried in menus. It worked great as a point and shoot even without the additional features. I took the book with me but never got around to reading it. I played around and managed to find the settings I wanted but am sure it does way more if I would take the time to learn about it.

Everything else is very good about the camera however, takes nice pictures, a little better than my older A3100IS Canon. Zoom is better, wide angle is better, Movie picture size is larger and file format is smaller so less bytes for a movie. it would be the perfect camera if it remembered the Macro setting.

The shake in videos is jarring. This camera is comparable to something that would have been released in the very early 2000's. I purchased this for the carefree simplicity for on the go fun however it's literally unusable if you have any desire to enjoy your memories. I'd recommend purchasing the HTC re from 2014 even though it's five years old and most likely difficult to find. Do some research and you'll see that the re far surpasses the IVY REC which is mind-blowingly shocking as it's 2019 and we're talking about a camera from Canon. Do your research, this is a 100% unbiased review (I've never previously reviewed a product) but I've been so burned by this I just had to air my disbelief.

KLC7^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-dragonfruit/6367051?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this free IVY REC Outdoor Camera (Riptide) to review. I found it to be a great little camera, unbelievably small for all that it can do! I was able to take clear crisp photos as good if not better than my smartphone camera. 
     What I also found surprising was even though it is advertised as an outdoor camera, it takes great pictures indoors too. There is no flash feature for indoors, but as long as there is light in the room, pictures come out great. 
    The video option is doable. Not necessarily the best but it does what it says and for those moments when a short video is needed, it is fine. I like the fact that it can all be downloaded to your phone or computer later.
    I think this little camera is marketed for younger people for it's usability to travel and rugged exterior. I took photos in the rain without worry. If dropped, it can withstand the pressure. The camera itself has an attachable clip which makes it easy to carry; I clipped mine on my purse strap. 
   The only drawback I personally had with the camera is trying to open the little door for inserting the  MicroSD card and the cord for the USB port to download and charge. My husband had no problem opening it but I simply couldn't manage it. Perhaps not the best feature if you are older, have arthritis or other issues with strength.
    I would recommend this product especially for children when they want a camera of their own but might drop an expensive smartphone when taking a picture."^4^Dec 3, 2019 1:20 PM
Bev31^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-dragonfruit/6367051?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this camera fot free in exchange for a review. I like the simplicity of the design overall to make it more 'point and shoot.' The wheel on the back to choose the shooting mode is very easy to use, but does require using a fingernail or something similar so I don't believe it could be turned on by accident. There is no option to review pictures, or to really see the picture before you take it, so how good the picture turns out is based either on luck or by practice. The clip is very nice, and allows the camera to easily be attached to a belt loop for easy access. The accompanying app requires little set up, but after that is pretty easy to use. The app let's you see the photos or videos you've taken and then download them to use elsewhere. I don't appreciate that the app is mandatory in order to have full use of the camera, but I understand that it is part of streamlining the experience so I accept it. Overall it is a nice simple camera for on the go, and it would be nice for people who just want to be able to take quick pictures but aren't worried about professional quality."^4^Dec 3, 2019 12:04 PM
dranreb^/canon-powershot-elph360-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/4866811?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^28^2^"This camera is small and lightweight. It easily fits in a pants pocket or purse (even a very small purse). I was very happy with how easy it was to carry around and use when traveling. I wish it came with a case though. The large, bright screen makes it easy to compose pictures. Anyone familiar with the Canon Rebel series would find the menus on this camera similar and easy to use. The camera gives you a lot of control in manual settings, but I also found the AUTO mode to be quite effective for most of my needs. I am very impressed with the photo quality, especially the accuracy of colors, like a blue sky. (I have seen other cameras 'wash out' a blue sky but not this camera.) The camera also does an excellent job in scenes with high contrast. The photos come out great and require little or no editing. Battery life is excellent and I like that the charger does not have a cord. One less cord to drag around. The charger's prongs fold up, too, so it is very portable.

One minor complaint is that I wish the lens had a wider angle in order to take more impressive landscape photos. Another complaint, which causes me to knock one star off the rating, is that the wifi is very clunky. It requires you to download an app onto your computer and sign up for a Canon image service. I would have expected to only need to download an app. Not create some kind of account. The wifi is a useless feature to me and I am happy to continue putting the SD card into my computer or printer slot.

Overall this was a great purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very portable little camera that has a good zoom and takes great pictures. It is good for travel because it does a great job in a variety of shots, whether you are taking landscape photos, close-ups, or photos of people. I brought this camera along on a trip where I also used my iPhone 6s for some pictures. The Canon ELPH 360 took better pictures, hands-down."^4^Feb 28, 2018 9:08 PM

I've owned a few ELPH cameras through the years and this one is as great as the others! Good features for a $210 point-and-shoot camera. Smartphone cameras are catching up in quality BUT Point-and-Shoot cameras are still better because they have a physical zoom lens. 
This camera has great photo quality, burst mode at about 7 shots a second, good low-light images, decent battery life(Make sure you have at least 2 spare batteries if you're going to be taking photos all day. And it's small and slim which it will easily fit in a pocket or in a small case with spare batteries attached to a belt loop.
Overall, a great compact camera. I definitely recommend the ELPH 360 HS over the ELPH 180 or 190 BECAUSE of the HS system, image stabilization(Especially when recording video) It's definitely worth the extra $40 or so.

It does lack a true manual mode, however (allowing the user to set shutter speed and aperture manually). The control buttons on the back are flush with the case, making the camera somewhat difficult to use in very dim light conditions. As with all point-and-shoot cameras that have no viewfinder, the display will be hard to see in direct sunlight. It has a lens cover that opens and closes automatically, which prevents losing a separate lens cap. The camera has connectors on the right side for USB AV out and HDMI interfaces, but they are covered by a cheap plastic cover that is difficult to get open until you file off the catches a little bit. The Li-Ion battery is small (only 800 mAh), and I have not yet determined exactly how long it will last (the manual claims 180 pix). I have only used the USB port to transfer pictures directly to my computer without going through an online service. I have not tried setting up the Wi-Fi interface yet to see if it would be easier to use. This camera has both High Speed Burst mode (about 7.2 pix per second) that will group the pictures and Continuous Shooting Drive Mode, which allows pictures to be taken continuously while the shutter button is held depressed (about 2.5 pix per second; pictures are NOT grouped)."^5^Jul 31, 2018 4:43 PM

But I've been cycling a lot lately and I wanted something smaller and lighter. I didn't expect to find it to have almost twice the Megapixels as my last SX so that was a pleasant surprise. If you're use to using PowerShot then the User Interface is about the same thing. Design choices come down to compromises. I would have preferred a screen that tilts up but I like getting so much picture taking power in something smaller than my hand with a good image stabilizer capability. I really like being able to carry this little guy around my neck or tucked into a little gadget bag on the bike. I haven't considered mounting it on the bike because I think that the vibrations may be a little harsh for it.

And really liked the Canon 300 better. It was much easier to use and when you would take pictures on the VIVID they didn't look FAKE. Today I went taking pictures of the changing of the leaves and Used the vivid and also the regular. The Vivid looks so fake. I was disappointed because I had to delete over 1/2 my pictures. However
This camera dose take good CLEAR pictures. I am sharing 2 pictures. One of the regular setting and one on Vivid."^3^Oct 19, 2016 5:43 PM
Harry^/canon-powershot-elph360-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/4866811?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^18^14^"I purchased this wonderful camera on February 15, 2019. I downloaded the required software and then spent about 3 hours trying to get the Camera connected to my computer. I then went on-line and downloaded the 157 page used guide but the chapter for connecting to a computer was for Windows 7 users. Canon customer service told me that the Camera worked perfectly on windows 7 but there are problems with windows 10. They blamed the problem on windows 10 but their camera was 'perfect'. The person asked me to make a number of changes (adjustments) to my computer so that the camera could upload pictures. I had no idea what I was doing but I was told that my adjustments would not hurt my computer or prevent any other software from operating correctly. The Camera still didn't work after about an hour of discussions and making computer changes. I was told that I could use a USB cable but I could still use Wi-Fi. I was told that sometimes it takes about 50 or more tries to connect the camera to a computer that uses windows 10. Each try takes about 5 minutes. Forget it. I returned the Camera on February 18th.

I question Canon's comment that the Camera works perfectly on windows 7 - you can't even purchase a computer that uses windows 7. Why does Cannon continue to sell this? Why don't they pull it from the shelves. And why doesn't Best Buy, Amazon, and other vendors inform their customers that Wi-Fi only works on Windows 7. What a colossal waste of time."^1^Feb 19, 2019 12:42 PM

The advanced technology will be of interested and value to some users who will spend the time of master the somewhat complex directions. For me, a pocket camera is superior to my iPhone allowing greater control over framing of the scene. The Flash is superior to my previous Canon camera.

So you can't move the photos onto your computer with a USB cord. You have to use wifi to do it wirelessly with the faulty, unreliable Canon software to get your photos off of this camera. And you need to register with Canon and fumble through a clumsy installation process before you can do that. That also requires that you have wifi available to you when you want to do the transfer - not just to install the software but also every time you move photos from your camera to a computer. I guess many people don't care, but that can be problematic depending on where you're traveling, and at home I'm wondering if it adds to data consumption. And the software for transferring the photos doesn't even work right, so I'll probably end up pulling out the SD card and using a card reader instead to transfer the photos. This is frustrating because the camera otherwise is pretty good. It's friendly to use, with the necessary features. It's a decent cheap point-and-shoot. I just really don't like this nonsense about not having a port to plug a cable into. That's a deal breaker, the way I see it.

Of course, if I was going to capture some cheetah hunt on some African safari I will have use something else like an A7 or similar but for the all day, semi pro, to have the advantage of carrying only the necessary equipment, feeling free, this camera is a great choice. Ok, indoor: that is a 50/50 answer and I explain: you first need to understand that if you are not going to be the weeding photographer or sport photographer for the event, you only need to catch that especial moment as the spectator for the event. The quality of the photos in manual mode (the one I use 99% of the time) depending on the illumination inside the dome (if it is a sport stadium) or a basketball court, will depend on when to change from Manual to Superior Auto. I used this camera on a religious event and I was able to catch from one side of the coliseum to the other side of the coliseum (about a 100 feets) with good quality, very good pictures. The video was of a very acceptable quality for the distance, lens, camera body (I was asking so much but filled the expectation). It is very easy to transfer photos and video using the Wi-Fi connection (moving photos to your phone; first you need to install in you phone the Play Memories App from the App Store  it is free). For the average photographer and for the money this camera brings all she/he will need. As said before, if you are covering the event and like greater quality pictures you should look to a different camera like a DLSR in the range of $900.00 or more and some quality lens (about $2,000) and the gear and so on. If you only want to have a great photo, carry a small bag and also enjoy the party, this is the camera, you wont regret it. Be sure to by a spare battery. The first one lasted about 4 hours a lot of pictures with 4 clips of a bout 7 minutes each. Then change the battery for the other remaining 2 hours of the event I was covering. As said, great pictures for up load in a PC, Internet, print, also print to a big 8 x 11 without loosing quality. Great camera!"^5^Dec 16, 2016 9:31 PM

The ease of use in automatic mode is matched with the great results in quality and sharpness. The camera performed great, especially capturing my kids that never seem to stand still. The only flaw is the lens cover does not come with a lanyard, so keeping track of it was a constant concern. The battery lasted for three days of picture taking. You need to purchase an extra battery and standalone charger. The camera only comes with one battery and must be plugged into the wall to charge via USB. If not for the battery issue I would have gave it 5 stars."^4^May 14, 2016 11:02 AM

Other reviews have said it is not a night camera - they are incorrect. It takes great low level shot. After it takes a low light shot, you can watch it adjust the shot to a clearer photo. It is not a pocket camera, but with hand strap it is easily carried without fear of dropping it. It has the best lens stabilizer I've seen, but the longer the shot, the greater care you have to use to get a clearer shot. I haven't tried a 256 GB SD card, but it easily addresses a 128 GB card. There is not normally a big delay between the press of the shutter button and the camera being ready for the next shot. Best yet it has a Carl Zeiss lens. It is not an all weather camera - take care in inclement weather and in dusty environments. Love this camera."^5^Dec 11, 2015 5:07 PM

I have taken lots of pics and vids and everything worked as expected. pic quality not the best, but decent considering the sensor size. light is your friend. setting the pixels to 5M also helps the sensor. Within the past 6 weeks an error code (e:62:10) started to display. I tired the work arounds found on the internet and that worked for about 1 month. Now I am finding that I will have to spend ~200$ to replace the lens, which is ~1/2 the price of the camera after 3 years and 1 month of use. I really like this camera and I imagine that when I look for a replacement the best option will still be this model. Hopefully this issue has been resolved. I want to stress that this camera has never been handled poorly. When I cannot clear the code you can see the lack of image stabilization in the view finder and in the pic. If I had written this review before this error occurred it would have been 5 stars. I am really disappointed that this happened after 3 years. Maybe Sony will help me out."^1^Oct 23, 2018 8:36 PM
Dillman^/sony-dsc-hx400-20-4-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4384007?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^13^5^"The camera takes superior pictures in daylight/bright light but the low light is extremely poor. I have a DHC-HX200 and it is superior in low light using the same settings. The DHC-HX200v can capture a illuminated museum display with great accuracy. Nice black background and crystal clear foreground. The HCX400 has a gray background with a huge blob of out of focus light for the foreground. Absolute terrible in side by side photographs between the HX200v and the HX400v. The worse thing about the HX400 is the memory card slot. When I change batteries, opening the batter cover partially ejects the SD card. I took over 100 irreplaceable pictures with the HX 400 with no error showing. After the last it shows a ' No card' error came up. Upon investigation it seems when you press down to close the battery compartment it ejects the card. There is no warning but the pictures are not saved. I could see the pictures when I shot them and after 'Processing' it went to the next picture but the pictures were not there at the end. I reseated the card and carefully closed the door. The next picture I took was saved with the next sequence number meaning the 100+ shots I took were gone with no trace of the files. I ran a card recovery software and there was no data on the card for the missing pictures. I lost a lot of memories with no way to recover and no error indication. My memory card works great in my HX200v. The 400v has incredible issues."^3^Sep 26, 2016 5:08 PM

While you don't get the flexibility, sensor quality or full capabilities that you get from a mid to high range DSLR, this is quite a capable camera. Probably best for families wanting to take high quality photos with extreme zoom, this camera delivers. Zooming to the maximum optical zoom - it's quite easy to take a steady shot. The stabilization technology is amazing. The sensor that turns on the view finder and turns off the screen is handy. That's another important point of this camera: It has a view finder. This may seem antiquated, but if you're making a decision to move away from a DSLR, it's a must - as it allows you to effectively frame your shot while steadying the camera (IS can only do so much) and is a must outside in the bright sunlight (as it's hard to see even the brightest LCDs).

Thousands of users on the Internet have the same problem, see for example http://sony-e-62-10.tk/ or look for E:62:10 on the Internet. If I had known I would never have bought this model.

And 3, I feel that at $350 on sale, this was a lot of camera for that price. So far I am very pleased. Love the WiFi and ability to use my phone as a wireless remote. I've even been 25 or 30 feet from the camera and remained connected. It will be great for taking family pictures.

Seagull5^/sony-dsc-hx400-20-4-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4384007?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^1^"I have come to the decision that for the money a bridge camera will give you the best all around camera for the money you invest. I own three now and each one has its advantages. The HX400 is a solid feature laden camera. The glass used in the lens is top notch. The focus is quick so any sports or Birding shots are not lost. As far as low light photos go being it has a small sensor it can struggle to find focus.
My other cameras are a Fuji S1. Another bridge with one big plus. A Weather resistant 24 to 1200 mm which is great for Florida. Also has a hard time in low light. The last and a great all around piece of equiptment is the Lumix FZ200...very bright F28 lens which will keep the F28 up to 600mm.
The HX400 is a very good camera....I had to buy a second one as I sold the first one and missed having a really good fun camera. Enjoy"^4^Dec 29, 2015 1:48 PM
milo^/sony-dsc-hx400-20-4-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4384007?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"This is a phenomenal camera for the price.

I bought this as a second camera for my wife to use while on safari. She's kryptonite to anything technology if it can break or stop working she will find a way to make it happen. With this camera however, she ended up taking some amazing photos on our trip of fast moving animals at distances I couldn't believe. The videos turned out even better.

Reasons to buy:
-This a great does-it-all camera: Enough megapixels to take photos for large print, good enough glass to make them clear and more
-The 50x (1600mm equivalent) zoom takes great photos at long distances with the right lighting - my wife got photos of monkeys at 500 yards that my 200mm/F2.8 would never be able to. The clarity was phenomenal and some will be on our wall, you'd swear we were closer
-The video quality is outstanding and the slow zoom makes for great landscape shots that zoom in on objects far away
-GPS- We were deep in the African bush and when I synced our photos all of them were geotagged, pretty cool
-Wifi - Using the playmemories app on Android or iPhone, you can control the camera and take photos or send your best ones to your phone from the camera for sharing online
-If you are already bought into Sony's camera line: this takes the same batteries and has the same menus as many others
-Viewfinder is good enough, it gets the job done. For better long distance shots, this is a must and is why the cheaper long zoom cameras without an EVF are just about useless
-Build quality is really good. The camera is also super light"^5^Sep 4, 2018 12:49 PM

The 50x zoon is great. I took a picture of the moon FREE HAND. it turns out pretty good. The camera took several pictures of the moon and re-compose them into one which I call it cheating. The craters are visible without magnifying much on my laptop. The other pictures are sharp and exposed just right.
The Firework program is not that great. Maybe I don't know the camera well enough. I did not have any pictures to bragg about. The night portrait program works well. it cuts down the blue tint from the sky to virtually nothing. The colors are true.
The battery ran out on me once. I am considering to buy a spare.

First day out with this Sony point and shoot I captured pin-sharp photos of birds like I never had with the Canon products. Without a doubt this Sony point and shoot is a dream to handle.

The Sony DSC-HX400 gives me an enormous zoom range, eliminating the need for interchangeable lenses. This means a big reduction in the weight of the camera/lenses set. The sensor is a phenomenon, producing images vastly superior to point-and-shoot cameras of the past. Even the low light capability is very good.

Raymond^/sony-dsc-hx400-20-4-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4384007?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I am upgrading from the DSC-H5 to the DSC-HX400.
I will start by pointing out that the camera does everything Sony says it will do. Specifically useful to me are 
 - image stabilization (clear pictures at full zoom)
 - good clarity in low light
 - good automatic composition (auto mode and super auto mode)
 - battery life is much better than the H5
The HX400 behaves like a higher end DSLR.

A couple of things I don't like:
 - the HX400 is bigger and heavier than the H5
 - pop-up flash is not auto-pop-up even on force flash setting.

The biggest beef with this camera compared to the H5 is the fish-eye starting point of the zoom lens. The H5 started out at 36mm equivalent which was fine for taking group photos - low distortion if any on the edges. The HX400 starts at 28mm equivalent which really stretches the faces of anyone outside the central ~2/3 of the composition. Zooming in to 1.5X fixes the issue but kills the spontaneity.
Hey Sony, can we get a setting to wake the camera up to a certain zoom level (but everything else stays automatic)?

In general a great camera that takes some getting used to."^4^Aug 31, 2018 5:31 PM
PebblesCO^/sony-dsc-hx400-20-4-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4384007?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I have been using a friends camera (the 300 model) for a few years and loved it. While at tournaments (only time I've used it so far), my friend noticed that it was slow to take pictures. There seemed to be an unusually long lag time between taking one picture and the camera being ready to snap the next photo. This is using the automatic feature. When I took it for USA Games tournament, I got to use it for the first time. I noticed that when taking distance photos, it struggled to focus (the 300 model did an OUTSTANDING job with focus). Then, when I got where it would take the telephoto shot, it wouldn't focus for the next shots, etc. I found the only way to get it to focus again was to power off the camera and turn it back on. I missed a number of precious photos of my athletes receiving their awards or performing in their events because of this focus problem. Taking camera back in case it is a lemon. Since the 300 model didn't have any issues, it is surprising that the 400 and newer model would have these difficulties.
Love the adjustable back viewing screen -- one of the major selling points for this camera. I had been also looking at the Canon T5i or Nikon 5300, which also have adjustable screens, but neither got near by budget of $500 -- even for Black Friday sales (only the T6 model hit $500, but doesn't have adjustable screen). I recommend getting a camera with the adjustable back viewer. It is so handy when you need to take pictures over other peoples's heads or down low -- like when taking pics of little kids. 
I'm hoping the focus issue can be corrected. I loved the quality of photos from the 300 model and was hoping for similar performance with the newer model. The 300 model took excellent distance photos, that when you zoomed in on the computer, didn't become pixelated and made it seem like you were a lot closer. I take sporting photos and often take photos from across football fields. The quality of zoom made that 100+ yard distance look like the photo was taken less than 10 yards away."^4^Aug 12, 2018 7:58 PM

 I just purchased this Sony 7-16-2018. I had read about the great zooming, It Is truly amazing! I mean amazing! But no one really talked about macro much. I have a little Canon Power shot SX710HS that takes the best macro pics and 30x zoom but I wanted more, so I bought a friends used Nikon P600, the zoom is great, and I got good photos on sunny days but the barrel started to stick, plus macro wasn't as good as my Canon. So I got this Sony 400, I took this Sony out of the box and used Auto for all the flower pics in bright sun on the river bend and for the most part they were all great, but I couldn't get focused up close on some of them. I don't know what ISO 200, 800, Aperture etc means, when do I use those settings? I need to learn that stuff, So I used auto. One problem I had with this Sony, as soon as you turn the camera on, it wants you to set the date, I'm not sure if it's just me but it won't set and stay so I have to hit cancel everytime I turn the camera on. When I press cancel, it goes to a screen 'go to www.sony.net/pm for playmemories software'. So I have to press two things before I can even begin to photograph. So let's get to MACRO, my Canon I can zoom to a bee on a flower and see pollen on it's legs and it is in focus. I can take a photo of just the bee, I've tried and tried to get that close on this camera but it loses focus each time. I got ants on a leaf (see photo) but it won't let me zoom into the ant. I turned the ring on the camera and it would show me the ants up close on the monitor but then it didn't capture the photo that way. Today was partly cloudy, I got great photos of a squirrel in the tree but not of birds on a feeder. I took from across the yard to behind a tree 4 feet away from the feeders. Being in the correct setting would've helped I'm sure. Not having a portable charger I thought would be no big deal, well it is! Having to plug the entire camera into the wall outlet especially with such a short charger cord is ridiculous and takes a lot longer than a portable charger. I will have to see if there's a charger I can buy and get an extra battery. If there is I suggest you buy one also. The Nikon 600 you can edit photos right on the camera, I haven't found that on this Sony yet. Oh the volume for the shutter, The Sony 400 kept showing function is disabled when trying to turn the shutter sound down. I did an online chat with Sony and he kept saying to record a video and I could then change the volume, it took 20 min for him to understand I just wanted to change the shutter volume, he finally said there's not a volume, it's either on or off. Ok so ISweep Panorama onscreen instructions say move the camera left or right or up/down. I kept trying the up and and it didn't work. First you have to go to menu, to the camera icon and scroll down to Panorama direction and set the way you want . Now on to Handheld Twilight setting, it's better than what I expected from reviews. I wish I could post more than 2 photos here to show you. Haven't tried night photos yet. And lastly, don't do what I did by just going to auto and start taking photos because there is actually a wonderful camera guide in the camera (that I just now found) that tells you tips and what setting to use for different lighting and where to find the setting in the controls. So turn the camera on, go into a shooting mode, press the ? button on the bottom right side and then menu and the onscreen help comes up. There's apparently a lot packed in this camera but it will take a beginner like me awhile to learn it. But my suggestion is go for it! 4 stars only because it's my 2nd day to use it and had problems with not getting the up close like I wanted. Maybe the instructions will help me with that now that I know they are there in the camera"^4^Jul 17, 2018 9:06 PM

I purchased the Sony camera based on a number of glowing reviews. I was first disappointed with its performance. The zoom mechanism is not sensitive at all. Then, when rapid fire shooting, the camera stops after ten shots and begins a lengthy image-saving process. But worst of all, this cameras images are nowhere near the sharpness and quality that I got with the old Canon camera. When enlarged, the images are very grainy, even at the lowest ISO. The details look like smeared paint. I am very disappointed with my purchase and feel like I threw away the money that I used to buy the Sony camera. I wonder if I just got a bad individual camera, because of the good reviews that I read. Oh well, you live and learn."^1^Apr 21, 2018 1:16 PM

However, I came to realize it was my unsteady hand that caused the blur. Excellent night shots of the moon, seeing great detail.

To be more serious with video, the accessory external mics are probably a good idea. For still pix, I am impressed with the low light capabilities.

Lyssakat89^/sony-dsc-hx400-20-4-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4384007?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"For the past few years, I have only had Nikon cameras; however, I started getting tired of them lagging and thus, missing my shots. With having 4 younger kids, it's hard to capture good pictures of someone not moving, so it's important to find a camera that can take good movement shots and my Nikons were not doing the job. On top of it, they would shut down randomly. I swore I would never get away from Nikon; however, I have done extensive reviews and I decided to try out a Sony. I decided to go with the open-box item because it was almost $100 cheaper. I just placed the order yesterday and it already arrived today. I took it out of the box and was pleased to find everything like brand new. I was also pleasantly surprised to feel how sturdy it felt. It was heavier than my latest Nikon P600, but for that reason, it does feel sturdy and better made. I haven't tried out too many shots yet, but for the few that I did, it definitely felt a lot faster and more crisp than I was used to on my Nikon. I am anxious to get outside more and take some more shots and especially more shots of my kids. I also love the zoom feature so far and the fact that you can zoom in 2 different ways, either on the lens itself, or, the button on the top. So far, I am pleased with my purchase and glad I chose to step out of my comfort zone and try a Sony!"^5^Apr 12, 2016 4:03 PM

It's not super fast, but that's not what it's for. It's sharp as a tack, but it can get overexposed when shooting in lots of light wide open (this could be my own fault, but I don't think it is). The f/2 aperture is powerful, and it shoots clear while capturing lots of color at night. When shooting up close you can also get a decent bokeh in the background.

Currently have no fix for this and waiting to hear back from Fuji about this (was told by Bestbuy) that it was not their problem and needed to be dealt with by the manufacturer.

First, it does what all the pro reviews say it does; that is, take wonderful pictures in an all in one and very compact format without a need to pack much else besides the camera. Two, I cannot recommend spending $1,299, plus whatever for accessories, for this gear simply because just about every other camera is just as good, and allows interchangeable lenses, and some in this price range have 4K video, too. But, the retro styling and small size may tip the scale for you, it did for me. There is a lot you can learn with this camera, both about the camera and about photography by using the camera.

While it won't be replacing my professional rig for most purposes, it is a great step up from a cell phone for vacation shots and even some natural light portraits.

Pros:
- Great in natural light/good lighting.
- Super portable.
- Full manual control.

Cons:
- It struggles a bit in low light/at high ISO.
- The focal length was a bit wide for me, so I bought the 50mm adapter.
- Not the best in high-speed situations.  If you're used to a DSLR, you might feel like you're 'missing' some action shots (kids playing, etc.).

Overall:
Great combo of form factor, image quality, and price, especially for travel/situations where a bigger camera setup isn't as ideal."^5^Jul 18, 2019 12:44 PM

The build quality is fantastic and if you're into manual shooting, this camera is definitely for you. It's not really for sports or spur of the moment grab shots, but for pics where you want to take your time and create an artistic photo. The downsides are 1) the fixed focal length, so if you don't want to use your feet to zoom, it's not for you 2) leaf shutter - the parameters of shooting with a leaf shutter take some time getting used to, but it's a bonus if you shoot often with flash 3) no IS - neither inbody nor optical.

However, it is not a camera for nature photography as the colors need to be adjusted all the time, most likely because they are optimized for portrait. 
A major annoyance is the number of buttons. There are too many. They all can be customized, which is fine, but you need to remember what is doing what, and then you discover that if you use some options, your initial choice you made no longer works. For example, if you choose Raw, the option to use the focusing ring to zoom digitally (which is an interesting option) does not work. But it takes time to find that this is why the digital zoom does not work!
Another major shortcoming is that it is too easy to hit a button, which triggers an option, which then had to be cancelled. This is especially the case of the quick menu button which one hits all the time. I guess that overtime one would get used to it. Overall, I am a bit disappointed by this camera. It is overpriced for what it offers. I have used in the past film rangefinders, which are so much easier to use and DSLR, which works much consistently the way you intend them to work. With this camera, the settings change too easily. Too bad, particularly in view of price of this camera."^3^Jun 18, 2017 7:07 PM

Great photos, excellent video, and very easy to operate. We still have this camera and love it. One of the reasons I upgraded was I could use the same batteries I already had with the new camera.

The good is this camera looks and feels great. Comes with an upgraded processor, 4k video and timelapse and a ton of bells and whistles. That is about where the good stops and the bad starts.

With the upgraded processor it seems to have some lag from when the shutter is pressed and when the image is taken. Big problem, I am trying to capture action and you really have to adjust your timing, but that is just the start.

The 4k video in a bright room was grainy and almost unwatchable - i didn't even share any of the dozen or so videos I took because they are so far from the quality I am used to. The focus on the video is another huge problem. It had trouble and would keep adjusting the focus during recording also adding to make these unwatchable.

The photos also leave a lot to be desired. I tried every mode and auto and the same result. Grainy, unfocused, even in good light. Low light forget it. The 4k timelapse was okay, it takes 24 minutes to make a 24 second clip and that was okay. The photos/video just did not cut it for the pricetag. I took this back. I may buy another of the camera I bought this one to replace.

I returned this unit for the video/photo quality - out of focus, grainy, even in good light. Check other reviews and judge for yourself - better yet go try one in person before buying to help avoid yourself the trouble of a return."^1^Oct 3, 2018 1:56 PM

Under the dim high school lights you can see the difference between this camera and my 7D but it still looks good.  The zoom on this camera is CRAZY!  I do not use the digital zoom.   This was my first game to use the camera tonight and what I did not like was where the record button is and how it feels.  My other cameras have the button on the back where I can see it and it is easy to press.  The record button is small and level with the camera.  I had a hard time finding it without shaking the camera.  I am attaching two images to show what the optical zoom can really do.  I had to reduce the quality slightly so I could attach the images.

It does have a neat function where you can bluetooth sync your phone and camera to use your phone as a remote. Just be warned it does seem to change the formatting on the card to do this.

Back in the day, I used a film SLR, digital SLR, and eventually a Canon SX10IS.  For personal reasons, I didn't want to bring something even that big along.  I'm SO happy I didn't!  The zoom on this baby is incredible! Quick video! So light, and intuitive to figure out without needing to refer to the quick start guide.  And my pictures and videos were AWESOME!  My dad, who fancies himself a semi-pro, and carried all of his big gear and lenses around, was a wee bit envious of how quickly I could get a shot just as good, if not BETTER than his! I think my zoom was better than anything he had with him!  ;)

*I loved*: size, weight, instructions on screen for various features, movable screen (to see better in glare situations, or for selfies!)

*Meh*: wrist strap is so long that it's practically non-functional (I had to swap with another device I had for fear of dropping camera), screen location seems like it might get scratched and camera is hard to hold without getting your fingers all over it (my SX10IS has a screen that opens up + a viewfinder), wi-fi capabilities are quite cumbersome/slow and I haven't found a way to send just one photo instead of dumping them all (Admittedly, I have not yet paired my smartphone with the camera, so maybe that's different.)

Thing was tough also fell and dropped it while the lens was open, after cleaning it up, things functioned 100%. Left it at the auto focus most of the trip, before buying this I compared it to a half a dozen different cameras it stood out from the others with quality pictures. Really solid feeling camera.

SawwhetMA^/canon-powershot-sx740-hs-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6287925?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I had tried to split the difference between my cell phone camera and my cumbersome 'good' camera... i wanted soething i could lift with one hand, turn on, and take pix also with one hand. I got a sony that should have been ideal but the camera would not save off the raw data and even great pictures looked 'muddled' when I zoomed in. I tried for a few years to love it, hoped for sweet firmware update of my dreams, but nope.

I went to Best Buy and picked the cameras up, tried them out, and ultimately settled on this one. I barely had the money for it - budgets being what they are, you know.... but at home, right out of the box, there was the familiar cannon button layout... and I fiddled a bit with the settings... and now - i'm taking pictures again!! To attach to documents, of my family, of my pets and other people's pets... i'm getting excited to start another 40-pic theme collage (20x40, print at walgreens, slip in a frame, and voila, decorate the walls with memories).

5 stars, really? Well, yeah. I decided there was no 'point' (har har) in taking off a star because it isn't quite trim enough to slip flat into my pocket. There's a wrist strap that I can shorten and use a carabiner to hang from a belt loop on those hands-free days. I can fit it in my pocket book. But most of all, MOST of all... 5 stars alone for pics not looking 'muddled' when I zoom in. 

I havent printed any blowups yet, but I will and I'll update the review after that if I can... 

I recommend going in to a store (when you are off quarrantine) and holding this in your hands and trying the controls out. I am so glad I did. There are 2 cameras I can upcycle now that i have this one to take their place!"^5^Mar 20, 2020 6:03 PM

Out of the box its an excellent YouTube videos, with supplied lenses. Comes with a very nice telephoto len as well in this bundle. This camera is so versatile that with all of its abilities kinda seems like a new camera every time you get a new app! The camera apps work great! The apps alone are awesome! Things you just cant do with a regular camera. Because its mirror less it can shoot up to 11 FPS! The apps also help beginners get the exact settings correct for a certain type photo. Now the software. The PlayMemories app lets say, is terrible. I got a Nikon a month ago. This camera takes better pics and video. But the PlayMemories app is the worst. Thank goodness once you get to know the camera you can get around some of it. I have a Cadillac camera with Edsel software. Its really bad. I wont say it doesnt work, but what should be minutes turns into hours. Its almost like after they got done designing the camera, the app was just slapped together. This software, (PlayMemeries) should be recalled. I sure hope Sony is working on the problems. Right after I got it there was an upgrade, made it a tad easier but way short of plug and play. More like plus and pray it works this time. With it Ipad, Android phone and PC, the software flaws are even more appearent. I cant say enough good about the camera. Weather your a pro or amature,m your will love this camera! You may cry however every time you have to use PlayMemories. You will have memories alright after using this garbage, truly sad garbage software. Really disappointed in it t say the least. It takes it from fun, to a nightmare of searching the internet for the same problems everyone else is having. I literaly found out to make it work from a photography studio. Sony has got to be aware of this! With the other manufacturers are catching up with mirrorless, Sony really needs to get on the ball with this mess or it will cause a huge Loss in sales from word getting out. Just read everything and expect some hiccups when trying to set up WiFi. Truly a nightmare. The camera is so good at its price though I would still recommend. You will know more about photography by the time your hooked up. Im speaking of the Playmemories app that has all the problems. The camera apps are great however. Playmemories is the software that communicates with the cam and computer. Really bad!!!!"^4^Feb 13, 2019 12:38 PM

The shake in videos is jarring. This camera is comparable to something that would have been released in the very early 2000's. I purchased this for the carefree simplicity for on the go fun however it's literally unusable if you have any desire to enjoy your memories. I'd recommend purchasing the HTC re from 2014 even though it's five years old and most likely difficult to find. Do some research and you'll see that the re far surpasses the IVY REC which is mind-blowingly shocking as it's 2019 and we're talking about a camera from Canon. Do your research, this is a 100% unbiased review (I've never previously reviewed a product) but I've been so burned by this I just had to air my disbelief.

KLC7^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-riptide/6367054?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this free IVY REC Outdoor Camera (Riptide) to review. I found it to be a great little camera, unbelievably small for all that it can do! I was able to take clear crisp photos as good if not better than my smartphone camera. 
     What I also found surprising was even though it is advertised as an outdoor camera, it takes great pictures indoors too. There is no flash feature for indoors, but as long as there is light in the room, pictures come out great. 
    The video option is doable. Not necessarily the best but it does what it says and for those moments when a short video is needed, it is fine. I like the fact that it can all be downloaded to your phone or computer later.
    I think this little camera is marketed for younger people for it's usability to travel and rugged exterior. I took photos in the rain without worry. If dropped, it can withstand the pressure. The camera itself has an attachable clip which makes it easy to carry; I clipped mine on my purse strap. 
   The only drawback I personally had with the camera is trying to open the little door for inserting the  MicroSD card and the cord for the USB port to download and charge. My husband had no problem opening it but I simply couldn't manage it. Perhaps not the best feature if you are older, have arthritis or other issues with strength.
    I would recommend this product especially for children when they want a camera of their own but might drop an expensive smartphone when taking a picture."^4^Dec 3, 2019 1:20 PM
Bev31^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-riptide/6367054?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this camera fot free in exchange for a review. I like the simplicity of the design overall to make it more 'point and shoot.' The wheel on the back to choose the shooting mode is very easy to use, but does require using a fingernail or something similar so I don't believe it could be turned on by accident. There is no option to review pictures, or to really see the picture before you take it, so how good the picture turns out is based either on luck or by practice. The clip is very nice, and allows the camera to easily be attached to a belt loop for easy access. The accompanying app requires little set up, but after that is pretty easy to use. The app let's you see the photos or videos you've taken and then download them to use elsewhere. I don't appreciate that the app is mandatory in order to have full use of the camera, but I understand that it is part of streamlining the experience so I accept it.

I am a professional photographer so I am very particular about my cameras. I usually purchase Sony Cybershots but I decided to switch up after doing a lot of research and a final recommendation from the store clerk. I'm not disappointed that I did. This camera is perfect, it shoots nice crisp pictures and has manual settings. It's small so I won't have to carry around a bulky camera to get professional quality photos. I love it."^5^Sep 20, 2017 6:19 PM
joshuaafterdark^/canon-powershot-g9-x-mark-ii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/5715505?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^18^4^"I picked this camera up about a month ago as a complement to my main camera, the EOS M6. I wanted a genuinely pocket-sized camera that could pack a punch, and boy does this little thing rise to occasion.

I knew it would have stellar photo quality because it uses, pretty much, the same sensor as the G7x and G5x series, which are incredible advanced compacts. What I didn't expect was just how small the G9x Mk II was going to be when I took it out of the box... This thing is TINY. And for the past month the photos and videos I've taken with it have pretty evenly matched those from the G7x and G5x I've used in the past.

There are 2 (minor) downsides to the G9x though. The first being the lack of a flip or articulating display. And the second is the fact that you cannot record in 60fps when in auto mode, you actually have to switch the dial to movie mode and set 60p as your desired recording frame rate.

At full price ($529) the camera is a bit overreaching. But at it's now pretty common $429 price it's a no-brainer to add to your camera arsenal."^5^Jun 2, 2017 5:43 PM

I bought this as a present for my wife, who uses it in AUTO for the most part. She is very happy with it, her only complaint is that the lcd screen can be hard to see in bright sunlight. She didn't try to increase the screen brightness to the max, so that may help on her next outing. If you are an enthusiast, you will have no trouble figuring out all the options and settings. If you just want to point and shoot, that will be fine too."^4^Jun 2, 2017 6:05 PM
InlandPNWShooter^/canon-powershot-g9-x-mark-ii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/5715505?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"This camera is currently available for $399 USD, which makes it hands down the best value in compact cameras right now. Sometimes I don't want to pack along my bigger Fuji system with multiple lenses, so I just bring this along instead. It doesn't disappoint. JPEG images look great straight out of the camera. Or, if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and messing with a RAW file, you've got that option as well. Take some time to dig through the menus to see what options are available to you. The in-camera HDR processor is surprisingly effective. I also use the time lapse video feature as well. Images are reasonably sharp, probably more than I would expect in a camera like this. And certainly more than sharp enough for web use. 

Physically, it's small and somewhat weighty due to its metal construction. It just feels sturdy.  Power up is quick; just the amount of time it takes for the lens to extend out of its housing. I've used the Canon phone app to transfer photos to my Android device, and it works like a champ. 

Just know what this camera is good for. You'll get nice shots of your kids indoor birthday party, but probably not of their indoor sports. You don't get much reach with the lens, so you might want to move up to the G7XmkII if you need longer zoom. I'm finding that it's great for travel/nature/landscape work, and an occasional street scene that I might come across. 

If you just choose this as your only stand-alone camera, I think you're making a good choice. Take some time to learn it and to understand what it can and can't do, and you should get years of great images."^5^Jun 26, 2019 6:22 PM

Im not even going to get into the cool new features. Canon has a lot of sponsored YouTubers that can show that stuff off. My opinion is based on the reality of actually using the camera. And it hasnt been good. That focus complaint is real. The touchscreen focus is hit or miss. But the face detect focus is broken. Sometimes the white box does seem to identify faces but it just wont focus. I know the common complaint is that a 2020 camera should have Dual Pixel autofocus built in, but the bigger problem to me is that this seems like a focus downgrade from the previous model. 

I really like this camera so Im tempted to stick with it and hope that a firmware upgrade is on its way. But then again, this is Canon and Im just not sure when/if theyll actually address the problem."^1^Aug 8, 2019 11:01 AM
DavidsAlterEgo^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^0^"I too was really looking forward to this release. A pocketable camera with great form factor that has a fast lens, built in ND filter, microphone input, touch screen menu system, USB-C charging, an easy system to transfer media wirelessly to my phone and a tiny flash that is surprisingly useful.

I pre-ordered it and was excited to add this to my photography arsenal alongside my other Canon cameras. The small size is perfect to carry along every day when the DSLRs stay at home. And the image quality is fantastic IMHO, provided youre shooting static subjects and are able to lock focus.

But.. and its a big but, the autofocus. Its terrible! Seriously, my old Canon S90 has a better autofocus and thats a 9 year old camera.

Additionally, if I even think about taking 4K video in anything but ta walk-in freezer it overheats in no time and locks up on you rendering the camera completely useless until its cooled back off.

I could go on and on about how awful it is, but see for yourself on the various (non-sponsored) reviews on YouTube. Its so bad, Im embarrassed for Canon and this is coming from a Canon fan with storm cases full of their products and former employee..

I honestly dont think Ive ever been so disappointed in a camera which is a shame because this one had so much potential."^1^Aug 12, 2019 7:59 PM
MadMensch^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^20^6^"I pre-ordered this camera the day it was announced as a replacement to our G7X Mark 2. The main feature I really needed was the Mic input, and the 4K option was nice as well. 

Thus far weve recorded a couple videos for our YouTube channel (The Montes Family) and if you watch the video titled How well do we know each other? youll notice the camera goes out of focus at certain points in the video and seems slow to correct. All previous videos on our channel were shot on the G7X Mark 2 and we didnt have that issue with the Mark 2. So it seems the concerns about autofocus on the Mark 3 are legit. My only hope is that the issue is fixed in a future firmware update because its unacceptable for a camera at this price point.  

The only reason Im keeping the camera is because I do like the fact that I can now connect my Rode mic directly and I no longer have to sync audio. Other similar compact cameras such as the Sony RX100 do NOT have a mic input so alternative options are limited. 

Other things to keep in mind; 4K video is limited to 9 mins per shot and the camera now requires a USB-C cable to connect to your computer (not included). I did have issues accessing my media directly from my MacBooks finder app, but was able to finally retrieve the media once in Final Cut Pro. Overall, I really wanted to love this camera but the autofocus issue has tempered my enthusiasm for now. Ill have to hold off on recommending this 100% until its addressed."^3^Aug 10, 2019 12:59 AM
joshuaafterdark^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^14^3^"So I preordered a G7X Mark III after LOVING the G1X Mark III and G7X Mark II, due to the fact that it had an external mic input and uncropped 4K (the first of any Canon camera to as well I think). So the camera comes in, I pop in the battery and my SD card, go into video mode and turn on 4K at 30 fps to do a sample test in excellent lighting and the entire camera falls apart. There box is around my face making it seem like I'm in focus, but nope it's drifting everywhere and once it does lock on focus it loses the moment there's any slight movement.

TLDR: On paper an excellent little compact camera at a great price compared to the RX100 VII, but the autofocus make it completely useless for video which is who this camera is targeted at."^2^Aug 10, 2019 8:53 AM

The audio on this camera was ok, so I used a small microphone on side and worked amazing. This issue I could overcome, what I cant get past is the horrible focus system. I know it doesn't have the dual pixel system like m50 but for the price the auto focus could have a better computer system for it. Vlogging with the camera for Our Micro Family we need a good camera, and this one did not work.  I would be interested in canon releasing a firmware update to improve the camera but the other issue is adobe does not support cr3 the new raw file format from canon so i had raw files I could not edit either. 
Long story short, canon is amazing brand but did not deliver enough to impress this vlogger."^2^Aug 2, 2019 2:25 PM
SlowMN^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III is a high quality camera with many great features. It gives the user extreme portability while allowing for professional level photos and videos.

The camera was paired with the SanDisk Extreme Plus 128 GB UHS-I microSD card, which is ideal for 4k video due to its fast read and write speeds and for storing a large number of high resolution photos. 

Features to note:
* 3' multi angle touchscreen LCD: The touchscreen is responsive and is easy to view from any angle. I did not have any issues with hitting a wrong button. When it is flipped up or down it is firmly attached and doesn't feel like it is going to snap off. The versatility of this screen allows the user to position the camera at angles other cameras could not while maintaining the ability to see what the camera is seeing. I think this is great because nothing is worse than recording something and finding out you or the intended object are not even in the frame! Overall, this screen is well implemented and a great feature.

* 4K video: The camera has the ability to record 4K video at 30 fps and HD video at 120 fps. It can be recorded in both horizontal (landscape) and vertical (portrait) positions. It has a multi angle touchscreen that can be flipped up 180 degrees so the user can see themselves while recording in both the horizontal or vertical orientation. Streaming is only available on YouTube and there are some additional requirements/limitations. There is the option to add an external mic to the camera in addition to the standard stereo quality mic that is included; however, the standard microphone delivers clear sound. Lastly, there is a HDMI output so videos can be played back on a large TV. These features allow the user to create high quality videos without needing to purchase a stand alone video camera. The quality of the videos are excellent, especially when recording in 4K. 4K is very power intensive/heat producing and I found recording shorter segments (a few minutes at a time) was the most efficient so the camera wouldn't get too hot. When recording in lower resolution, the camera did not experience any overheating issues. If you are thinking about vlogging/streaming or creating home/casual videos, this camera hits the mark.

* WiFi/Bluetooth technology to transfer photos/videos: Using WiFi technology, it was straight forward to transfer files from the camera to a smart phone. I used an iPhone 11 Pro Max running IOS 13.3. You download the CameraConnect App from the Appstore and follow the onscreen instructions. It gives you the option to connect via Bluetooth or WiFi. The directions are clear and even the most novice user should be able to successfully pair the camera and phone. ***A note for connecting via WiFi - If you have an installed VPN that connects on demand, you will be unable to connect to the camera until you turn off this option in the VPN settings on.*** Within the App you can turn on/off geotagging on photos if you do not want that information available. 

Please note there was a known issue with auto focus but this has been addressed by Canon with a firmware update on 12/12/2019.

Overall, this camera is excellent. It is compact in size but packed full of amazing features. It allows you to take beautiful high resolution photos with its 1 inch 20.1 MP sensor and up to 4k 30 fps videos. I believe it out-competes all smart phone cameras in both photo and video quality. It is highly competitive in its camera class. I highly recommend this camera."^5^Dec 27, 2019 11:18 PM
drumanji^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I've shot a lot and have had this since day one/launch and with patience I've been getting some decent shots out of this thing. (Lifestyle, product shots, at the beach, indoors.) I was waiting until I could view the RAWs. However, I have to make an effort to make sure what I wanted in focus is in focus. It likes to focus on the background leaving subjects out of focus. Once its locked on though the shots are great. So the AF on stills isn't as bad as with video. But it's so bad for video I don't even consider using it... especially if i wanted to VLOG and can't 'man the camera.' The focus box shows you're the object, but focuses the opposite. It takes ages to finally lock onto focus, but its fickle to lose it again. That and the overheating while using FHD 120p or 4k. I'm also stuck with 30fps as the lowest framerate it can go. If I switch to PAL I can get 25fps at least. That being said I bought this for my wife who never really used cameras other than a cell phone. I wanted something for her that she can literally point and shoot and maybe she'll gain interest in some gear, but I'm having trouble justifying why things don't work or are out of focus for her. Back to video: I've resorted to finding focus on me, for example, and switching to MF to be able to have peace of mind that it wont jump to the background. Of course, I have to make sure I stay the same distance the whole time though. I still have a few weeks before I am out of my return window and I'm hoping they release a firmware fix. If not, then I know what is going to replace this. (Hint: it has 24fps, doesnt overheat, Eye AF etc)

Pros: 
-Size:Feature Ratio
-Ergonomics
-1.8 aperture (W) | 2.8 (T)
-FAST high speed capture
-Touch Screen Menus 
-ND filter
-MIC input
-Flip screen
-Wifi/Bluetooth
-Image Stablization in Video is decent enough (no complaints)
-FHD 120/60 fps
-No crop 4k (take a hint EOS R lol)

What I don't Like:
-no viewfinder
-AUTOFOCUS
-FHD is a little soft
-lack of dual pixel AF
-overheating in 4k and FHD 120p
-no shoe for the mic (not a big deal)
-no 24fps
-contrast focus, not phase detect 
-no LOG profile
-constrained ISO in 4k
-battery life could be better

All that being said, I can get decent results out of the camera, but that is not without putting in some solid effort and patience. Using this thing is tedious. I've never googled or looked up a camera (almost daily) AFTER I bought it to find fixes or to see if others share the same problem. What good is a camera if the pictures you care about aren't in focus? What good is a camera with video if the video isn't in focus and you have to throw out footage? What good is a camera that doesn't let you use it because it overheated?"^1^Aug 20, 2019 11:02 AM
Bren^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"If I can sum up my review in a short manner, it is only that you NEED to ignore these reviews that are outdated and/or ignorant of the fact that Canon has released a firmware update to address the problems this camera was having with autofocus etc. Before I did anything shooting or filming, I made sure to update the firmware first. 

The steps to do this are fairly simple, but there are only a couple of poorly shot videos on the internet that outline how to do it in simple terms. I will give a crack at it in this written review. 

The equipment required is an SD card, a computer with internet access for downloading the firmware update (version 1.2.0 as of December 12th, 2019), and a bit of time. I formatted the card in the settings on the Camera (this wipes it completely clean, so be careful) and then plugged it into the SD card reader for my computer. On Canon's website, I looked up the firmware on the support page where I was able to download the Zipped folder containing the update file and PDFs in different languages on how to perform the upgrade. There are both Windows and Mac OS X versions available. I unzipped this folder and dragged the file PSG7X3_120.FIR onto the SD card (not inside a folder, just the main page). I then flipped the setting wheel to 'P' and pressed the view button to turn it on. On the settings page, go to number 5 and scroll down to firmware. It will show you the current firmware version (1.0.1. is what mine displayed) and it will ask you if you want to update the firmware. Select OK. It will then go through the process and shut off. When you boot it back up to check, it is updated! It then gives you the option of two autofocus modes; Mode 1 is what you want for a quicker, more adaptable autofocus while filming.

The process is simple enough, taking less than 10 minutes, and is worth taking the time to do for a camera whose predecessor is so esteemed and loved by many. 

I hope this review and like I said, ignore the negative reviews that make no mention of updating their camera first with the latest firmware! Thanks for reading this and have a good day!"^5^Dec 23, 2019 6:54 AM
SirGalahad^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"So, I got this to try and increase my quality for my YouTube tech reviews and to possibly use on my Twitch stream for a face cam. For the most part it is a good choice, as it does a lot of things right, but as many other reviews have mentioned, there are some glaring negatives that will make a lot look elsewhere. Im not an expert at cameras. Im almost as run of the mill as you can get. Ive been using my cell phone (iPhone X) to do any of my picture and video recording needs but wanted to upgrade. 

The first thing youll want to do when you receive the camera is install the two firmware updates that have been released since the camera first came out. The first includes an improved autofocus that is substantially better but still doesnt fully rectify the issue. The second adds a 24-fps option to video recordings. Two things that were desperately needed and should have been available at launch. The update process is relatively simple. Its strange to me that this camera has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but you cant download a firmware update through that. 

BUILD QUALITY/USE: 

The materials on this camera are a mix of plastic and metal. Overall, it feels well built. It has a small spot for your thumb on the back right and a small hump on the front right with a matte material to help with grip but because its so small and light its not the most comfortable. Most of the time I tried to use two hands just to insure I didnt drop it. When vlogging there is a nice area to grab even when the screen is flipped up so there shouldnt be any problem there. 

On the front of the camera you have a 20.1 MP, 1-inch sensor, 24-100 mm f/1.8-2.8 zoom lens with a control ring around the lens, which can be used to perform multiple functions such as shutter/aperture control, zoom, EV compensation, and ISO adjustment. On the front right is the small handgrip I previously mentioned. In single shot mode you can track subjects and take advantage of face detection. This works well but as you can see from other reviews, it isnt flawless, and can leave a lot to be desired. These options dont work with burst capture. It supports 4k 30 fps but only for 10 minutes at a time or else it will overheat. You can also do 1080p 120fps slow motion capture, but it is not as sharp as the other modes. Stabilization is good. I didnt have any problems and it was better than my phones. When in focus, image/video quality is very good with low image noise, nice colors, and good detail. There is softness at the edges of the lens and tends to overexpose itself. Image quality and overexposure is better on this camera than on my phone. 

On the top of the camera going left to right you have a power on/off button, shutter release, below the shutter release is the zoom, then a mode dial, and under the mode dial you have an EV compensation control which goes from -3 to +3. All these buttons feel solid without wobble. Some may say they are a bit tight as it can be hard to switch the modes with just your thumb. 

On the rear of the camera, going left to right, top to bottom, you have a high quality (but not quite as high quality as some smart phones) LCD touch screen with an adjustable tilt that goes up, down, and forward for vlogging/selfies. A lock exposure (*), record video button (usually 1080p 30/60fps), a command dial that has four direction presses. On the outside of the command dial is a rotational dial that does the same thing as clicking in a direction. Up is for drive/delete, right for flash on/off/auto, down for info, and left for macro/manual focus. In the center is a q/set button. Under that you have a play button to review previously taken photos/videos on the memory card, and a menu button to adjust settings. By pressing the q-button it gives you a lot of other options to select either through touch or through using the direction buttons to further adjust your picture depending on the setting you are on. 

On the right-hand side, you have a micro-HDMI, USB-C port, and Wi-Fi button. The camera has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Setup is straight forward and easy. Via Bluetooth you can connect to your phone and send pictures and then upload to social media that way. You can also control the camera with that as well. Wi-Fi allows you to upload your photos to certain cloud platforms and certain social media sites. You can live stream directly to YouTube but during a live stream it does not capture the footage to your memory card. In camera charging is supported but it also comes with an external charger. 

On the left you have your flash slider which pops the flash up and a 3.5 mm microphone connector. 

On the bottom right, you have a battery port with the memory card holder. It supports SD, SDHC, and SDXC memory cards. Battery life for my use was great. However, it wont last you all day shooting with a CIPA rating of 235 images. 

PROS:
 Ease of use
 Everything except the auto focus just works and works well. 
 Picture/video quality (at this price point and when in focus)
 Ability to manually control a lot of features. 
 Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. 
 Zoom
 Touch screen
 Excellent pocket camera for vlogging. 
 Works well on streams (twitch) as you can passthrough without anything on the screen. 
 Literally pretty much everything about the product except for price and autofocus. 
 Has better quality photos/video than my iPhone when setup correctly.


CONS: 
 No EVF
 Auto focus is much improved with new firmware update, but it still leaves a lot to be desired. My phones focus is so much better. 
 Battery wont last all day for shooting. 

CONCLUSION: 

This camera is packed full of features and the spec list for this price point is great. Build quality, operation, and ease of use works great except for the focus. It is a good pocket camera that is made as a point and shoot camera for noobies like me. It was easy to setup and learn. Picture/Video quality is good when it is in focus. I have very little negatives. However, the focus leaves a lot to be desired and makes me not want to use the product. As I feel like I spend more time trying to get the stupid thing to focus on what I want than I do making content. It also takes me more time because I must go back and record or take a photo of something if it is out of focus. Or skip forward when editing video to wait for it to focus. You can also miss moments waiting for the camera to focus. Yes, the picture/video quality is better than my iPhone X in all regards. I can also take photos in dark or bright environments better because the lens is better. Though not dramatically and at this price point it is a very hefty tax to pay for it. I reverted to just doing manual mode for almost everything (including focus) and my experience with that is great and has made me enjoy the camera a lot more. But doing so made me learn a lot more about cameras than I was at first expecting.

With all that said. I just dont know if I can recommend this camera strictly due to the focus. As I think the target demographic for this camera is for individuals like me who have very limited knowledge of cameras and just want it to work. But you must fiddle with settings to get the best quality out of it which requires a learning curve. Most reviews from people who know what they are doing dont seem too put off about the focus. Likely because they are doing manual mode in which the camera is great. For those who are more casual users and arent as serious about picture quality and learning new things, then I just dont see why the camera on your cellphone wouldnt be adequate enough and allow you to save $750."^4^Dec 30, 2019 6:26 PM
doop22^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"My knowledge of cameras and photography boils down to can I trust my cellphone to capture my subject quickly, accurately and look good enough on Auto settings to share. But since I received the Canon PowerShot G7 Mark III, I've been trying to branch out and fiddle with White Balance, ISO, Focal Length, RAW and the likes that comes with working with a real camera. I've learned a little bit to get better shots but Auto mode works just fine for me.

Overall, I definitely see the benefits of owning and using a Real camera but just whipping out my phone and snapping my subject such as my cats is just so much easier.

Back to the camera. It's packed full of features that make it a compelling option for a beginner like myself. Has WiFi, and Bluetooth to connect to my phone, laptop or email to get my images to things I use everyday from the app. The charging/transfer over USB-C is a great touch for future proofing. The flippable view finder is great for vlogging if you're into that. 16x zoom helps you get in 

On the downside, the camera has issues with my SD card saying it can't be found or requiring a reformat only to end up working again through a power cycle.

In the end, I do enjoy using the Canon, when I remember I have it around and wish to use it. A great beginner option in features and price until you can get into DSLR and Mirrorless options."^4^Dec 19, 2019 8:53 PM
Njuice^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Although smartphones have made it easier for anyone to be a 'photographer', there is still a need for high quality standalone cameras. The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III continues to prove the need for cameras by offering high end specs but while also conforming to the smartphone era.

PROS:
- Once unpackaged, you notice how small the camera feels and overall how elegant it feels. Its a nice mix of having so weight and form to it so that it feels high end - but not too much to make it feel clunky. I am a big fan of the black design and I think overall its very pleasant to have and hold.
- Set-Up is mainly a breeze! There are a few options you set up on the front end and then its ready to go. Of course you can do a deep dive into the options menu to change preferences etcbut if you want to you could start using this camera almost right out of the box which is great.
- I would highly recommend you utilize the Canon Camera Connect App and I think most users will. This app is overall what you will use to communicate from your smart phone to your camera. It offers tons of great features including taking a pic, quickly transferring that picture to your phone, and then you can edit/post/send that to whatever you need to. Very easy to use and great idea for many people as they want content instantly.
- The 3 inch touchscreen is one of the best feature of this camera. It really provides clarity for the images/videos as well as offers incredible ease of use. The multi-angle view is fantastic when taking different angles but also for the selfie view, its a way where you can take a picture or take video and see exactly what is being taken. It really helps makes your content better overall.
- I was very impressed with how great the 4K video looks on this Camera. It just adds to much depth to whatever you are recording and playback looks wonderful on it. Very pleased that Canon did so well on the 4K!
- Finally, most importantly this Camera takes pictures so well! The lighting is always great, there is great definition in the picture, and the auto-focus is great. I know some people had issues with the focus at first but Canon has a Firmware update out and its essential to download as you should update firmware on anything you use.

CONS:
- The box does not come with a few items I wish it had which is a USB-C Cable, carrying case/pouch, and a memory card. All of those you will have to provide on your own.
- Updating the Firmware requires you to plug your Camera into your computer via a USB-C cable and downloading the firmware from the website. You would think a camera like this could do it all via WiFi with no cables but it doesn't and I think its a step back for the ease of use for the camera user.
 
BOTTOM LINE:
- The Canon G7 X Mark III will make so many people happy: travelers, vloggers, social media users, and those who just want to just capture family memories. It has enough ease of use to just grab it and go, but enough deep features for people who really want to dive into making the best content possible. I used to think my Smartphone took pictures that were just as good as professional cameras, but after using this I know how far off I am!"^5^Dec 18, 2019 9:26 AM
1ShadowFox1^/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/6359937?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"We live in a generation of cell phone photographs. And why not? The cameras incorporated in modern cell phones are ridiculous The clarity, processing ability, and convenience because its always there. But can cell phones really compete with a modern quality purpose built digital camera?

My first impression of the Canon Powershot Mark III was that feels SOLID. This camera is heavier than you would think and you can usually tell the quality of a device my how solid it feels. And to dive further, every knob, button, and switch on this camera feels VERY well made. I have no doubt that this camera will survive travel and usage for some time. 

When its comes down to using this camera, my experience has been that there is a STEEP learning curve to it. I am not the most experienced in sophisticated camera usage. I have used my Samsung phone a lot, I LOVE using my variety of GoPros, but I wanted to graduate to a true 'skilled' camera. There are LOTS of settings, the camera will integrate into your phone, it might even fold laundry for you. I have used this camera very heavily throughout the holidays and I am pretty sure I havent even scratched the surface on what this camera is capable of. 

What this camera does not do...FOCUS! I have read reviews prior about this camera and seen the complaints regarding the focus speed of this camera, but Canon came out and said this issue was resolved with a software update. It has not. This camera takes a LONG time to auto focus. I took my daughter to see Santa before Christmas and thought this would be a GREAT opportunity to get acquainted with this camera. Static shot in a controlled environment. Easy, right? NOPE. This camera would NOT focus. After 2-3 minutes of my toddler sitting quietly on Santa's lap and behaving extremely well, this camera would not focus at all and I could not get a picture of my little one with Santa at all. Luckily the retail store Santa was at was supplying free pictures. This is unacceptable to me. There was nothing complex to this photo at all. I was able to catch other family photos in different environments, but none more important than the picture I missed out on.

Also, going from very cold outside to temperature controlled indoors I have had issues with the lens fogging over and taking a long time to become usable again. 

With practice, I believe I will get better with this camera. I have a vacation in May in which I am heading out of country and will be taking this camera with me and video blogging. I am hoping by then I can get more familiar and take all of the great pictures and videos in the world. But I still feel that this camera and its auto focus needs an overhaul. Until then, I really can't recommend this camera.

Long story short...at present time I can not see a reason to bring this camera with you as its difficulty of use and the auto focus is terrible. Your cell phone will do everything you need and them some. This camera will leave you frustrated.

However, there are also a few key drawbacks of the camera. The biggest of these is probably the autofocus system, which is considerably slower than that of the Mark II. The internal audio for the camera is also lacking, and since there is no hot or cold shoe to attach an external microphone, it is difficult to mount. Hopefully one of the leading microphone companies will come up with a solution to this problem soon. Its 4K abilities are also limited, especially since you cannot record sound when recording in 4K. The camera does well in low light, and is great for quick stills, but it has a ways to go in terms of video. If new firmware updates are able to improve the autofocus system and a company like Rode comes out with a good external mic that sticks to the side of the camera, this will be a great vlogging camera! Until then, I will probably continue to use my Mark II."^3^Dec 22, 2019 5:21 PM

So I had to buy that instead. Its a shame. They didnt give it dual pixel auto focus so its pretty much useless. They make better cameras at a lower price it doesnt even make sense.

While it does sometimes struggle to autofocus, it's an issue that resolves itself pretty quickly once you touch your face on the touchscreen viewfinder. Once you do that, the rest of the video normally stays in focus. 

One thing we have loved about this camera is that on the touchscreen, there's a button to start/stop the video. In addition, this camera is AMAZING in low light conditions which has been a huge plus since our house only gets good natural lighting for a few hours every day. 

The Canon G7X mark III also gives a wider picture on video mode which has been nice for vlogging because we're able to fit more in one frame. While we don't normally use a microphone, it's nice that this model can actually have one. 

Overall, we've loved this camera and personally think it's a huge step up from the mark II. The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the autofocus isn't 100% perfect every time you use it."^4^Aug 27, 2019 2:05 PM
radarvector^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5755149?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^66^0^"First off, I'm a 40+ year Nikon System shooter, from film SLR's to DSLR's. I've been searching in vain, quite some time, for a first class compact prosumer type camera. Something that I can carry with me at all times and not sacrifice high image quality.

This is it, for me. This camera is phenomenal on every level.

Hiking around with 5 DSLR bodies, and 20+ lenses is not practical, and invariably I'll leave out the lens that I wish I had brought with me.

No more. This is the perfect 'walkabout' camera, and Nikon has nothing in this category that even approaches the image quality of this little gem.

The Zeiss optics are clear and bright, the autofocus system is fast and accurate, the creative options are extensive. Pricey? Yes, somewhat, but the old adage that you get what you pay for applies here.

I recommend this to all enthusiasts and serious photographers out there. You will not be disappointed!"^5^Nov 2, 2012 6:21 PM
TBCass^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5755149?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^64^12^"I have been an enthusiast photographer since the 60's. My primary cameras have been mostly SLT types. I have on occasion tried more compact type cameras as something more convenient to carry around but they have been, without exception, unacceptable to me due to mediocre image quality, manual capabilities and overall speed and responsiveness, auto focus and shot to shot times in particular. When this camera first came out I was impressed by the universal praise it received from professional reviewers so I decided to give it a try as a take everywhere addition to my camera kit.

I have had the camera for over a month now and have taken over well 1000 photos with it and am happy to say it, if anything, exceeds my expectations. The speed is DSLR like including fast auto focus. Due to the ability to customize the functions of the wheels and buttons I have it set up just the way I want it making it extremely easy to use whether for manual or automatic use.

As far as handling, at first the small size put me off but after a few days I got used to it and now I have no problems. Some people complain about the lack of a hand grip but for me it isn't needed on a camera this small and light. It may make one handed shooting a touch more difficult for some but it hasn't caused me a problem. I usually shoot 2 handed anyway. I was even able to use it simultaneously with my A65 holding the RX100 in my right hand, the A65 in my left, shooting video with the RX100 and stills with the A65 pushing the A65 shutter button with the little finger of my right hand.

The only thing lacking with this camera is an eye level viewfinder but I can forgive that omission because with a camera this small a decent one would be impossible to include without increasing the size of the camera significantly. The LCD is usable in bright sun when you set it to the brightest setting.

Last but not least the image quality. In this area I have no complaints at all. Up to iso 800 it can compete with any DSLR, at iso 1600 and 3200, it is a small step behind. At iso6400 I find it unacceptable but few cameras of any kind are acceptable at 6400 as far as I'm concerned.

All things considered, the combination of small size, speed, handling and image quality make this camera worth every bit of it's $650. In face I call it a bargain. If I could give it 6 stars out of 5 I would.

A final comment about video. I am not as serious about video as I am about stills but, other than the lack of a separate microphone jack, the camera is very good with results competitive with Blue Ray quality. The built in stereo mic is adequate for general use.

A final comment about the flash. Some complain about it's location but I have no problem and it can be bounced, a first for a built in flash. Besides, there's no else you could put it."^5^Sep 23, 2012 6:12 AM

I am traveling to Argentina to do mission work for over a year and I wanted DSLR quality pictures and full HD 1080p video that could fit in my pocket. I have exactly what I want in this camera. I didn't want to be carrying a huge DSLR or a micro 4/3 around in my hand and get robbed in a foreign country. This camera is perfect to whip out of your pocket, take a picture with less than a second power on time and snap that picture with almost no focus time. When people see my photos they ask if they came from a DSLR because they are so sharp, bright, crisp and clear. I love the ring around the lens that spins, you can have it adjust the zoom, the exposure, the filter, anything you want, and the Function buttons and menus are completely customizable. The shooting filters are so much fun to play with, it has in camera HDR, color selection with blue, green, yellow, and red, miniature focusing, watercolor, color pop, B&W and so much more. Photos at night time are amazing. You get what you pay for and I would pay even more for this camera with the quality you get that actually slides into your pocket. When I opened the box, I was actually surprised to see that the camera was smaller than I thought. I bought a waterproof/dustproof Pelican 1010 case that it fits perfectly in and a lcd scratch protector from Sony. I am thoroughly pleased with the camera, it is super fast, all metal build, and stunning quality.

The only con that I can find is that the black paint on the exterior stratches easily, but can be fixed if kept in a case.

And with the review above, the manual is lacking, but once you start using the camera it is extremely easy to catch on."^5^Aug 23, 2012 6:25 PM

If you want a quality camera that will literally shoot in the dark and get the image others will miss, This is the camera for you! The images blow me away even at high iso. Video is crystal clear and image stabilization is great. I love the way the camera charges by simply plugging in. Keeps things very simple and works with any car or home usb charger. Seriously, there is nothing not to like. I used to carry a bag of gear everywhere I went. Now I carry my Sony in my pocket all the time. My last point and shoot was a Canon G11 with a 2.8 lens. This will knock its socks off especially in low light. I tried like crazy to like the G11 but always felt it was a compromise. Not with this. I'm now getting exactly what I want.

I have too many hobbies to take on photography too but I wanted to get 'good enough' to stop having rookie mistakes in what would otherwise be great shots.

Although I firmly believe that 'knowing the technique' is the key to a better shot and that hardware cannot fix the eye of a bad shooter, this camera re-defines that to some extent. Out of the box it eliminated many of my 'quick-shot' mistakes and it takes amazingly clear, well-focused photos. In full auto mode it does an outstanding job of picking the right settings.

Can my shot's be better if I learned more about photography technique and control, absolutely! I bought this expecting to do just that... however what I have found is that I use it more as an excellent point-and-shoot and still only use 10-20% of it's full capability as a full-featured camera.

It's quite a bit larger than my previous point and shoot but small enough to have with you most of the time. Jumping to a full-body SLR meant I would only have it 10% of the time I need it and with the RX-100, it will be closer to 80%.

Things to consider...

If you buy the form-fitted leather case for it (which is excellent BTW), it does add enough bulk that it's no longer pocketable with the exception of jackets and cargo pockets.

The flash is in an awkward location. i've almost dropped the camera twice when it popped up under my finger and startled me.

When zooming into a picture in playback mode, the default is to jump waaaaaay too far into the picture and you have to zoom back out. I wish this was configurable (or that I could find where if it is...). 1/2 as far would be ideal for me.

It's almost as much as an entry-level full body SLR, but don't let that scare you away. It's well worth it and VERY unlikely you will get camera envy any time soon."^5^Sep 12, 2012 5:51 PM

You will need to adjust the autofocus choice I think, but otherwise you won't have problems. The camera makes good choices.

The experienced photographer will be getting this camera because they want something more DSLR like, but can fit in a pocket and/or be inconspicuous when used. How this beats all other pocketable cameras: 1. (most importantly to me) it is low-light capable and leaves plenty of pixels for cropping a wide shot where the aperture is 1.8, 2. the 1' sensor gives great DOF as expected, 3. the control ring is useful (I would prefer it to be stepped, and not have to be turned quite as far for use) 4. very quick to take pictures even in low light with the assist beam turned off.

Trumps the Panasonic LX7 in IQ, as well as pocketability. Quite similar in size to the Canon S110, but better IQ due to the larger sensor. These are the only 2 that are cheaper that would offer similar low-light capability if you need to save $150 or so.

I think this camera would be better priced at $525ish. Having said that, I would not willingly give it up for any other pocket camera no matter how much cheaper. I have been waiting for an upgrade from my Canon SD4000 (2 years ago it was the only pocketable camera with low-light capability). But nobody has provided one that did anything better at the same size. The Canon S95,100 had RAW capability, but there wasn't much to be gained from such a small sensor. So their purchase wasn't justified.

Bottom line - if you want a small camera with good IQ, THIS is the camera to get. All other camera's in this size fall short."^5^Dec 7, 2012 11:28 AM

This Sony totally smokes not only them, but everything else in the point-and-shoot category. It's in a class of its' own; nothing I've ever owned comes close except a dSLR with a fast lens. I could find no fault with this camera; it's a dSLR that fits into your pocket.One simple feature really stood out for me: the flash tilts, so you can bounce-flash indoor shots.

The only two things I dont care for is that when you charge it, you charge it from the camera adapter, and not by taking the battery out.

Sometimes, I carry my main system cameras (either the Nikon D600/D3s or a Leica M9). Yet, these systems are heavy. When I want to travel light, I want a high quality camera that can give me pictures that are equivalent to what I would have gotten from either a Nikon or a Leica but that do not take up a great deal of space.

In the past, I have used Canons (S90/S95), Olympus (XZ-1), and Fujifilm (x10). Based on reviews from places like DPREVIEW and photographyBlog, I decided to look at the Sony RX100. Simply put, this is a great camera. What did Sony do right: large sensor - check; good sets of control - check; high quality images - check; a decent Automatic white balance - check; a really compact decision where the lens is protected when not in use - check; programmable lens control ring - check; 10 fps full-resolution burst shooting - check (great for kids and sports); shallow depth of field - check; superb Zeiss lens - check.

This is not to say that this is a perfect camera. In its current form, it lacks an electronic view finder (i.e., a viewfinder that replaces the rear viewing screen -- something nice for those like me who grew up with film cameras with their optical view finders); its rear control wheel is not customizable; there is no built-in memory and lack of 'no card' warning.

Yet, in spite of these minor quibbles, this is a great camera. Buy it - you will not regret the decision. This camera currently beats the best of Nikon (P7700 or P330) and Canon (S110/G1x/G15). This camera has been universally highly recommended in most of the reviews. If you use it, you will see why."^5^May 9, 2013 8:41 AM

The automatic settings do great for everyday shots without having to tinker with settings. When I have a complex shot, the manual controls allow me to take great photos in low light conditions or when focus needs to be honed in to capture the picture.

The photo quality is amazing. The 20 MP image allows me to enlarge and crop the photo without pixelating.

Conclusion - Pros

Excellent image quality and solid ISO performance
Class-leading movie features and quality
A good degree of customization puts your favorite settings at your fingertips
Fast operation, including focus and Raw capture
Flexible lens range (though a brighter zoom would have been nice)
Excellent range of additional features (sweep panorama and auto HDR in particular)
Good battery life for this class of camera
USB-charging (with fast charger) makes it easy to travel light

Conclusion - Cons

Clickless control dial contributes to vague and unengaging shooting experience
Flash metering is unpredictable
Lack of ND filter can limit the ability to use wide apertures
Screen hard to see in direct sunshine, despite WhiteMagic technology
No official option to fit filters onto the lens (third-party glue-on adapters are available)
In-camera raw conversion would add flexibility
Playback confusingly separated into stills, MP4 and AVCHD sections
Lag when trying to zoom in playback mode is irksome
USB-only charging makes it awkward to use a spare battery"^4^Dec 15, 2015 9:23 AM

So, you need to be interested in a small but high-quality camera to consider this one.

If you use this camera as a point and shoot for vacations and other events, then you can leave it in the Auto+ mode and once you get the hang of letting it automatically take exposure brackets or just multiple shots to composite in low light then you will have very high quality images ready to go on the camera immediately.

If you are using this camera as a small and easy to carry enthusiast or companion to a pro camera, then you can set it up to save the RAW data or take the exposure bracket and let you do the HDR and other processing later. Or often you can just let the Auto+ mode do its thing and go back to manual settings only if the results weren't satisfactory.

Startup time is great and it takes pictures pretty quickly. The Auto+ mode slows things down since it does the processing right after taking the images, but it has enough internal buffer storage to hold 5-7 shots before having to pause to write to the card.

The 1' sensor is large for this class of camera, but it still isn't all that big. Other optics and sensor features push it to a higher performance than the larger sensor would alone. Low light capability is impressive for its size and this camera takes better backlit photos than any I've had before. Supposedly the second and third versions of this camera are even better in backlit scenes than this one.

There isn't much in the way of a zoom on this camera. And image quality degrades a bit the further you zoom in. At 20 megapixels though you can get away with some digital-zoom-style cropping after the fact.

You will get some barrel lens distortion with this camera, more than I've seen on other compacts. But, as a tradeoff you get a wider angle lens, so hard to call this a pro or a con."^5^Aug 11, 2014 8:31 AM

It took me a few hours to understand the basics because I ? every option vs trying to study manual. It also has a way to save favorite option setting choices to scroll through that you might use more often. It is great in low light, sunny, panoramic, foggy all settings. Indoors at night in low light like a bar scene I don't even need a flash in fact I haven't even used the flash yet. Megapixels are great. Every shot comes out great. Pictures included are hand held shots no tripod because I don't have one yet. Zoom feature is really great also. The defocused background can get a little confusing but you can widen the area so it focuses more of the picture and if you zoom it tends to pick up the background more like in my sunset pic with tree branch hanging down in front of me, the sunset came in clearer which is what I wanted.

There is no argument at ~$1000 the coolpix A does in fact have a larger image sensor than the ~$600 rx100. Using the Coolpix A what really bugs me is the lack of actual zoom on this thing and the slow autofocus on this thing as well. Lastly there is an annoying thing where there is a little switch on the side to switch to between: macro, auto focus and manual focus. The lack of image stabilization is another bad thing
*** the RX100 lens does have image stabilization.

RX100 advantages does have faster auto focus, in superior auto you do not need to physically hit a switch to go in between macro and auto focus. (it does what it suppose to do auto detect that its a macro picture or other scene options)
*** The Macro on the RX100 is also significantly better as well, I prefer the macro on the RX100 as I can get a closer shot to the object before the focus does not work anymore.

But do realize in real world situations a faster auto focus, image stabilization will generally snap you a better picture than a camera with slower auto focus especially when you are using auto mode on these two cameras.
*** Where the RX100 shines is the faster auto focus being able to snap multiple pictures at once and choosing the best picture of the bunch it snaps. To me if you want an all around camera the RX100 would be the definite choice but if you are maybe just taking pictures of landscapes or non moving pictures on a tripod the Coolpix A might be a better choice.

If you google rx100 vs coolpix a you'll find spec comparisons and reasons why you might wind up falling in love the RX100 over the coolpix A. I also recommend trying them both in person I bought the rx100 first and
*** then bought the coolpix A seeing if I would replace the RX100 but winded up returning the coolpix A."^5^Apr 24, 2013 12:27 PM

I read the reviews here and on dpreview and found that this camera, while not the cheapest, was compact but did not sacrifice image quality. Out of the box I had no problems since I am familiar with the Sony menu style. Took amazing pics at Disneyworld and fit easily in a pocket or purse. Very good low light sensitivity. Christmas lights at Hollywood studios came out well. Good battery life. The popped-up flash can be a bit tricky to push back into the body, but once you get used to it all fits back together well.

Many common used features are easily available with fewer strokes.
On the negative side, the camera is expensive, does not zoom as much as preferred, a little thick to slip in pocket and, the Sony case hangs around your next and doesn't clip on to belt.

After trying it out, I would definitely agree with the image quality! Low light pictures were amazing, and a fast zoom as well... Battery life was actually pretty good too. And it feels solidly built like a quality product should...

The only negative things I can say are:

1) Price is still a bit too high for a pocket camera, even though the 1' sensor does warrant the price range... Does a Canon S110 have an acceptable comparison of image quality for half the price? Might have to try it out for yourself to compare...

2) Body was slippery for me as the front had nowhere to really provide grip, and the thumb grip in the back is pretty small. Definitely make sure to use the wrist strap, as I almost dropped it a few times!

3) The image preview zoom was surprisingly slow, even though I used a Class 10 16 GB card. I'm also not really a big fan of the way Sony's zoom all the way in too tight first, and then you have to zoom out to see more of the picture. I supposed it's nice if you want to quickly make sure a photo you just took is sharp so you can take it again if necessary, but since most of the time the RX100 takes sharp photos, this was more a pain than a gain."^5^May 22, 2013 6:04 PM

CallMeKid^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5755149?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^1^"I got this and though a little dissapointed with the instructions and how to use documents on camera itself. I have you tubed info and googled info and called Sony tech and even they couldn't figure out how to put a micro sd card in it but it says it takes it. Other than that hog wash, once I got the basics of the camera and figured out when the dial is set to SCN to turn the ring on the lens housing to switch to different modes, I loved it, I was finally able to do the Macro shots I wanted where Auto wouldn't do them. The images are beautiful and this camera is amazing for a point and shoot. I'm not impressed with blown up images though, actually kind of disappointed with that. I don't like you can't crop on the camera itself but it does allow you to zoom on an already taken picture for some reason? Sony will refer you to get Play Memories for free but I had a bunch of pictures and my comp blows, so it just kept loading and I could never access anything, but they said I could crop with that program. Other than the negatives I've stated it's small, it shoots quick if want to take a bunch of pictures one after the other, clear zoom is nice, great auto focus if set in the right modes, takes beautiful color pictures and fit's in a case in your jacket pocket. I advise the wrist strap to be used, it's a please drop me I'm so hard to hold onto item. P.S. You won't use the flash much, it just washes out most photo's making them lame."^5^Feb 2, 2016 1:40 PM

This would be the 4th p&s that I've owned and by far the toughest to learn. Yes, I could just let it go on intelligent auto everything but I want my 500 dollars worth!

A lot of what I consider essential features are buried too deep. This requires modifying the camera's settings essential. Specifically, low light is buried in the already difficult to change scene mode. Need to bring that closer to the top and not require so much digging around.

All in all it's worth it. Though the camera is barely a pocket camera, the imagery makes it totally worth the effort and slight inconvenience."^4^Aug 2, 2014 2:07 AM

I got this camera to carry in place of a FF Nikon when it makes better since such as when spending time with family is more important than concentrating on a DSLR but wanted semi DSLR capabilities. My only complaint is the flash pop-up position creates a learning curve on how to hold the camera but the pop-up flash allowing movement for bouncing off the ceiling etc... makes up for this minor convenience.

A bit heavy for a point an shot but worth the weight.
At first some time will be needed to understand the menu and camera settings could be confusing. Control Ring is great for 
manual focus and a must for that one of a kind photo. Color is great and speed and camera reaction is fantastic for a point and shot. 
I have been taken 35mm since the 1960's and have had many cameras. I now have a Sony a200 . however with 15 grand kids i needed something i could carry around in my pocket. Have used other point and shoot cameras but nothing could freeze kids fast enough or could take one picture after another fast ,until i purchased the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100. 
I must admit it took me about 3 months to decided because of the price and not knowing if it would do what i expected of the camera. When I seen on Best-buy wed site and open-box in excellent condition for a price i could live with i decided to purchased(and with a return policy that was 15 days) i would see if the camera could do what i wanted it to and it did... 
Cons
Price .. A bit weighty for a point an shot, Does not use AA batteries 
Flash does get in the way of holding camera when it pops up(But does give good coverage) No view finder Screen a bit hard to view in bright light . 
Overall an excellent point an shot for fast kids and fast movement.
i Purchased the extra metal hand grip and screen saver overlay.
from Amazon ..you will not be disappointed. The hand grip will make holding the camera a lot easier and safer. Also your fingers will not get in the way of the flash coming up."^4^Apr 20, 2019 10:55 AM

One thing - there is basically no user's manual, so you'll have to go online to read everything you need to know about the camera and the futures it holds. But if you have a pc it's no problem. I did it and wrote down the most important to me information, so I'll have it for the future references. Also the location of the pop-up flash is not good.

Charlie^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5755149?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I love the image quality and the size of the DSC-RX100 for which I would give a 5 star rating.  It fits easily in a pocket and takes great pictures.   Because it is small, and has decent image quality I take more pictures with this than I do with my Canon 70D.

Originally the price seemed high, but nowadays one can find this for under $400 which seems reasonable compared to competitive models.  If the camera were more robust I would look at the newer models.

My only complaint is the camera is easily damaged when around water which is why I am on camera number 5.  If I could get this image quality and size in a water resistant/proof camera I would buy one tomorrow.  Until then I will purchase the protection plan and do my best to keep it from being damaged."^4^Sep 7, 2019 8:02 PM

The flash works well and I'm sure there's a reason to extend it from the body like it is but the mechanism seems very fragile and would break easily.

Camera does not disappoint with image quality and controls. Strongly recommend purchasing an external battery charger and second battery so you can continue shooting when the first battery runs out.

The user interface on this camera is very good about describing what the settings will do in layman's terms. Within a day I was snapping amazing pictures. Within a couple days I was handy enough with the controls that I could get shots that make me feel like a pro. I was a little upset with the quality of the video. I didn't spend any time with settings, so this was a little less fool-proof. But, I am a big fan of how capable this camera is for capturing shots from a moving vehicle.

Compared to the highly rated Lumix FZ300, this compact superzoom has more features in a significantly more compact design. The high resolution, numerous filters, time delays, flash syncs and other custom settings beat the majority of bridge cameras on the market. The aperture ring, viewfinder and tilting touch screen were what attracted me to this camera in the first place, but Panasonic's remote image app was the icing on the cake. The app works flawlessly, allowing you to control virtually any camera & video setting from your phone. While this is a compact camera, it is a brick of a compact. You won't find yourself tucking this in the pocket of your jeans comfortably. With the battery installed, it comes in at 300 grams (10.58 oz). It's a chunky thickness of 4.1', 4.3' wide and 2.75' tall. The camera comes with a battery, a charging cord (and a short one at that) and the manual. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of a wall charger. Charging the camera with the battery installed is an accident waiting to happen. The cord is too short for it to rest comfortably anywhere out of the way. I went ahead and ordered a wall charger and two extra batteries to make life easier. Other than that, I have no complaints. Great design, great features, awesome camera! I waited months for this to release and it was worth every penny!"^5^Jun 18, 2017 7:37 AM

That said, I was in the market for a higher-end point-and-shoot and decided upon this. I wanted a viewfinder so I didn't have to always look at the screen, so thought the extra money on this camera was well spent. That all said, the camera is a bit thicker than I'd like. I find myself using my cell phone for photography more and more because I just don't want to carry the bulk of a camera. I was hoping this was a little thinner, a little lighter. That's really the only reason I took a star off, other than wondering when they will next make big leaps in the quality of the photo (maybe we've plateaued) so I can feel justified in replacing my old camera that really is just as good except for the video."^4^Jan 13, 2019 1:36 PM
Jerry^/panasonic-lumix-dc-zs70-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-silver/5866713?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"This is the 4th or 5th Panasonic ZS series camera I've bought. Although the ZS70 is not the latest one, it has a 30x zoom, which is a feature I wanted in my point-and-shoot. I'm a little more serious at photography than the average point-and-shooter, I think, but I wanted the long zoom and realize I've sacrificed some of the picture quality to be had in the newest ZS100. That said, ZS70 still has a lot of features and all of my Panasonics have given me good quality photos. The LCD on this one has a lot more capabilities than my last ZS50. Although the LCD screen swings up (to facilitate selfies), I wish it would swing down. I'm not likely to take very many selfies, but it would have been great to be able to tilt the screen down and hold the camera over my head. That is a missed opportunity for Panasonic, in my book.

If you want amazing zoom in a pretty-close-to-pocket-sized camera, this is the one for you. If you want amazing picture quality, you might want to look to the ZS100, which has a 1 sensor (compared to the ZS70's 1/2.3 sensor) even though both cameras are rated at 20 megapixels."^4^May 17, 2018 3:31 PM

dranreb^/canon-powershot-elph360-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-purple/4866802?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^28^2^"This camera is small and lightweight. It easily fits in a pants pocket or purse (even a very small purse). I was very happy with how easy it was to carry around and use when traveling. I wish it came with a case though. The large, bright screen makes it easy to compose pictures. Anyone familiar with the Canon Rebel series would find the menus on this camera similar and easy to use. The camera gives you a lot of control in manual settings, but I also found the AUTO mode to be quite effective for most of my needs. I am very impressed with the photo quality, especially the accuracy of colors, like a blue sky. (I have seen other cameras 'wash out' a blue sky but not this camera.) The camera also does an excellent job in scenes with high contrast. The photos come out great and require little or no editing. Battery life is excellent and I like that the charger does not have a cord. One less cord to drag around. The charger's prongs fold up, too, so it is very portable.

One minor complaint is that I wish the lens had a wider angle in order to take more impressive landscape photos. Another complaint, which causes me to knock one star off the rating, is that the wifi is very clunky. It requires you to download an app onto your computer and sign up for a Canon image service. I would have expected to only need to download an app. Not create some kind of account. The wifi is a useless feature to me and I am happy to continue putting the SD card into my computer or printer slot.

Overall this was a great purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very portable little camera that has a good zoom and takes great pictures. It is good for travel because it does a great job in a variety of shots, whether you are taking landscape photos, close-ups, or photos of people. I brought this camera along on a trip where I also used my iPhone 6s for some pictures. The Canon ELPH 360 took better pictures, hands-down."^4^Feb 28, 2018 9:08 PM

I've owned a few ELPH cameras through the years and this one is as great as the others! Good features for a $210 point-and-shoot camera. Smartphone cameras are catching up in quality BUT Point-and-Shoot cameras are still better because they have a physical zoom lens. 
This camera has great photo quality, burst mode at about 7 shots a second, good low-light images, decent battery life(Make sure you have at least 2 spare batteries if you're going to be taking photos all day. And it's small and slim which it will easily fit in a pocket or in a small case with spare batteries attached to a belt loop.
Overall, a great compact camera. I definitely recommend the ELPH 360 HS over the ELPH 180 or 190 BECAUSE of the HS system, image stabilization(Especially when recording video) It's definitely worth the extra $40 or so.

It does lack a true manual mode, however (allowing the user to set shutter speed and aperture manually). The control buttons on the back are flush with the case, making the camera somewhat difficult to use in very dim light conditions. As with all point-and-shoot cameras that have no viewfinder, the display will be hard to see in direct sunlight. It has a lens cover that opens and closes automatically, which prevents losing a separate lens cap. The camera has connectors on the right side for USB AV out and HDMI interfaces, but they are covered by a cheap plastic cover that is difficult to get open until you file off the catches a little bit. The Li-Ion battery is small (only 800 mAh), and I have not yet determined exactly how long it will last (the manual claims 180 pix). I have only used the USB port to transfer pictures directly to my computer without going through an online service. I have not tried setting up the Wi-Fi interface yet to see if it would be easier to use. This camera has both High Speed Burst mode (about 7.2 pix per second) that will group the pictures and Continuous Shooting Drive Mode, which allows pictures to be taken continuously while the shutter button is held depressed (about 2.5 pix per second; pictures are NOT grouped)."^5^Jul 31, 2018 4:43 PM

If you're use to using PowerShot then the User Interface is about the same thing. Design choices come down to compromises. I would have preferred a screen that tilts up but I like getting so much picture taking power in something smaller than my hand with a good image stabilizer capability. I really like being able to carry this little guy around my neck or tucked into a little gadget bag on the bike.

I downloaded the required software and then spent about 3 hours trying to get the Camera connected to my computer. I then went on-line and downloaded the 157 page used guide but the chapter for connecting to a computer was for Windows 7 users. Canon customer service told me that the Camera worked perfectly on windows 7 but there are problems with windows 10. They blamed the problem on windows 10 but their camera was 'perfect'. The person asked me to make a number of changes (adjustments) to my computer so that the camera could upload pictures. I had no idea what I was doing but I was told that my adjustments would not hurt my computer or prevent any other software from operating correctly. The Camera still didn't work after about an hour of discussions and making computer changes. I was told that I could use a USB cable but I could still use Wi-Fi. I was told that sometimes it takes about 50 or more tries to connect the camera to a computer that uses windows 10. Each try takes about 5 minutes. Forget it. I returned the Camera on February 18th.

I question Canon's comment that the Camera works perfectly on windows 7 - you can't even purchase a computer that uses windows 7. Why does Cannon continue to sell this? Why don't they pull it from the shelves. And why doesn't Best Buy, Amazon, and other vendors inform their customers that Wi-Fi only works on Windows 7.

For me, a pocket camera is superior to my iPhone allowing greater control over framing of the scene. The Flash is superior to my previous Canon camera.

We didn't want to spend too much since we've invested in a camera for photographing already. So we opted for a simple, compact camera with video capabilities for our toy reviews. So far so good, except my only complaint would be the battery life. I'm used to having my Canon Rebel Eos Xs and rarely ever having to charge it, but this requires a charge with every use it seems. Other than that, it's simple, easy to use and love the auto settings it comes with!

So you can't move the photos onto your computer with a USB cord. You have to use wifi to do it wirelessly with the faulty, unreliable Canon software to get your photos off of this camera. And you need to register with Canon and fumble through a clumsy installation process before you can do that. That also requires that you have wifi available to you when you want to do the transfer - not just to install the software but also every time you move photos from your camera to a computer. I guess many people don't care, but that can be problematic depending on where you're traveling, and at home I'm wondering if it adds to data consumption. And the software for transferring the photos doesn't even work right, so I'll probably end up pulling out the SD card and using a card reader instead to transfer the photos. This is frustrating because the camera otherwise is pretty good. It's friendly to use, with the necessary features. It's a decent cheap point-and-shoot. I just really don't like this nonsense about not having a port to plug a cable into. That's a deal breaker, the way I see it.

Compared to the highly rated Lumix FZ300, this compact superzoom has more features in a significantly more compact design. The high resolution, numerous filters, time delays, flash syncs and other custom settings beat the majority of bridge cameras on the market. The aperture ring, viewfinder and tilting touch screen were what attracted me to this camera in the first place, but Panasonic's remote image app was the icing on the cake. The app works flawlessly, allowing you to control virtually any camera & video setting from your phone. While this is a compact camera, it is a brick of a compact. You won't find yourself tucking this in the pocket of your jeans comfortably. With the battery installed, it comes in at 300 grams (10.58 oz). It's a chunky thickness of 4.1', 4.3' wide and 2.75' tall. The camera comes with a battery, a charging cord (and a short one at that) and the manual. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of a wall charger. Charging the camera with the battery installed is an accident waiting to happen. The cord is too short for it to rest comfortably anywhere out of the way. I went ahead and ordered a wall charger and two extra batteries to make life easier. Other than that, I have no complaints. Great design, great features, awesome camera! I waited months for this to release and it was worth every penny!"^5^Jun 18, 2017 7:37 AM

That said, I was in the market for a higher-end point-and-shoot and decided upon this. I wanted a viewfinder so I didn't have to always look at the screen, so thought the extra money on this camera was well spent. That all said, the camera is a bit thicker than I'd like. I find myself using my cell phone for photography more and more because I just don't want to carry the bulk of a camera. I was hoping this was a little thinner, a little lighter. That's really the only reason I took a star off, other than wondering when they will next make big leaps in the quality of the photo (maybe we've plateaued) so I can feel justified in replacing my old camera that really is just as good except for the video."^4^Jan 13, 2019 1:36 PM
Jerry^/panasonic-lumix-dc-zs70-20-3-megapixel-digital-camera-black/5866714?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"This is the 4th or 5th Panasonic ZS series camera I've bought. Although the ZS70 is not the latest one, it has a 30x zoom, which is a feature I wanted in my point-and-shoot. I'm a little more serious at photography than the average point-and-shooter, I think, but I wanted the long zoom and realize I've sacrificed some of the picture quality to be had in the newest ZS100. That said, ZS70 still has a lot of features and all of my Panasonics have given me good quality photos. The LCD on this one has a lot more capabilities than my last ZS50. Although the LCD screen swings up (to facilitate selfies), I wish it would swing down. I'm not likely to take very many selfies, but it would have been great to be able to tilt the screen down and hold the camera over my head. That is a missed opportunity for Panasonic, in my book.

If you want amazing zoom in a pretty-close-to-pocket-sized camera, this is the one for you. If you want amazing picture quality, you might want to look to the ZS100, which has a 1 sensor (compared to the ZS70's 1/2.3 sensor) even though both cameras are rated at 20 megapixels."^4^May 17, 2018 3:31 PM

I'd recommend purchasing the HTC re from 2014 even though it's five years old and most likely difficult to find.

Do your research, this is a 100% unbiased review (I've never previously reviewed a product) but I've been so burned by this I just had to air my disbelief.

KLC7^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-avocado/6367458?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this free IVY REC Outdoor Camera (Riptide) to review. I found it to be a great little camera, unbelievably small for all that it can do! I was able to take clear crisp photos as good if not better than my smartphone camera. 
     What I also found surprising was even though it is advertised as an outdoor camera, it takes great pictures indoors too. There is no flash feature for indoors, but as long as there is light in the room, pictures come out great. 
    The video option is doable. Not necessarily the best but it does what it says and for those moments when a short video is needed, it is fine. I like the fact that it can all be downloaded to your phone or computer later.
    I think this little camera is marketed for younger people for it's usability to travel and rugged exterior. I took photos in the rain without worry. If dropped, it can withstand the pressure. The camera itself has an attachable clip which makes it easy to carry; I clipped mine on my purse strap. 
   The only drawback I personally had with the camera is trying to open the little door for inserting the  MicroSD card and the cord for the USB port to download and charge. My husband had no problem opening it but I simply couldn't manage it. Perhaps not the best feature if you are older, have arthritis or other issues with strength.
    I would recommend this product especially for children when they want a camera of their own but might drop an expensive smartphone when taking a picture."^4^Dec 3, 2019 1:20 PM
Bev31^/canon-ivy-rec-waterproof-outdoor-digital-camera-avocado/6367458?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^3^"I received this camera fot free in exchange for a review. I like the simplicity of the design overall to make it more 'point and shoot.' The wheel on the back to choose the shooting mode is very easy to use, but does require using a fingernail or something similar so I don't believe it could be turned on by accident. There is no option to review pictures, or to really see the picture before you take it, so how good the picture turns out is based either on luck or by practice. The clip is very nice, and allows the camera to easily be attached to a belt loop for easy access. The accompanying app requires little set up, but after that is pretty easy to use. The app let's you see the photos or videos you've taken and then download them to use elsewhere. I don't appreciate that the app is mandatory in order to have full use of the camera, but I understand that it is part of streamlining the experience so I accept it. Overall it is a nice simple camera for on the go, and it would be nice for people who just want to be able to take quick pictures but aren't worried about professional quality."^4^Dec 3, 2019 12:04 PM

Canon to the rescue! The G5X has the 24-100 mm range of the M2 and adds a great built-in viewfinder, a fully articulated LCD screen, and a solid build with a good grip. It's like a mini DSLR.

I tried both this and the Canon Powershot G7X Mark ii, and in the end, I kept the G7X Mark II and returned this one. Nothing really wrong with the G5 X, but I felt the G7X was superior for my needs and preferences, particularly low light indoor action shots (basketball). I also think the G7X produces richer tones and colors - more of the Canon 'pop' with high saturation that I prefer. These differences were very subtle, but those were the deciding factors for me personally. Both cameras are great though, and it really just comes down to preference. If you prefer an actual viewfinder, then the G5X is the camera for you... I will also add that Best Buy handled the refund / exchange for me flawlessly, with a smile!

As you know I went with the g5x for many reasons like I preferred the flip out screen to the flip up screen because there are so many angle varieties and you can also flip the screen to where it's hidden so you won't get any scratches.

I wanted something that fit in a pocket and yet took photos that were better than a phone or point and shoot could produce. I'm very happy to report that this camera excels in that regard! Picture quality, sharpness, color accuracy, low light/night shots are excellent. The tilting/pivoting screen, hot shoe and the viewfinder are major pluses also. Many of the cameras in this class and price range have one or even two of the above but not all three! I've been shooting mostly in auto mode (the camera does a fine job all by itself) with the occasional aperture or shutter priority thrown in. I found that a much higher percentage of my shots were keepers compared to my point and shoots, almost on par with my dslr. Fit and finish of this all metal beauty makes it look and feel like it should cost a great deal more than it does. Better than some of the DSLR's out there. It feels good in my hand, with all buttons and dials right where they should be. If there was one thing I could wish for it would be for a longer zoom.

I have been trying to connect my phone to the camera through the polaroid pop app for almost 5 hours. Even loading the paper took me so long because I thought you had to push the paper in all the way and for the longest time the camera kept reading that it was out of paper. LUCKILY I stumbled upon a discussion that states you have to put the paper ALMOST all the way in for it to be sensed by the camera. There is not one thing in the 'user manual' that even talks about that. who would've known that automatically? The camera comes with something they call a 'user manual' in reality all it is, is a quick start up guide that is very, very vague. It gives you no information on connecting the camera to your phone through wifi and the app which is probably the most complicated aspect of this camera. I tried calling their 1800 technical support number and it is closed until January 2, what type of 1800 isn't 24/7/365? especially when Im sure they would be the busiest since so many people probably bought this product for Christmas. For the $200 it would probably be in your best interest to just buy a portable printer and a cheap grade instant camera. Also if you're someone who googles for answers, good luck trying to find any answer on how to set this thing up. They're non existant.

I loved the fact that it was digital so you got to review the film before you printed it and the quality stated it was 20 megapixels! What else could you want out of an instant film camera right? Wrong! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The quality of the prints were so bad compared to my $99 Fujifilm Camera. It was so bad I thought I bought a defective one. I actually went back to BestBuy exchanged it for another brand new one and the quality was still complete ****. It shocks me that this product has ONLY positive reviews.

Dwight^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-green/6090004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Didn't give it a four because the first one I got didn't work. Got a prompt no hassle exchange from Best Buy. Produces a picture similar to the old Polaroid, only better quality, quicker, no waiting to develop. Much more compact than the old Polaroids. Can put it in a jacket pocket. Would like it better if it filled the paper. Adding writing underneath with your finger difficult, useless. In addition to the larger print size, this camera has the advantage over the Polaroid Snap Touch in that it lets you know frames remaining for your film, and frames remaining on your Micro SD card. Doesn't have rapid fire pictures like Snap Touch, but it does do GIFs. Very happy with it, friends seeing it want to know, 'Where can I get one.' 'Best Buy' of course. The advantage of this camera and Snap Touch over other instant print cameras is it's digital, you don't have to waste film on bad shots, or you can print many of a good one. With the LCD what you see is what you get, no view finder error."^4^Mar 9, 2018 9:41 PM
Evrosado^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-green/6090004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^3^"So I did research and found mixed reviews for the Polaroid Pop camera. I liked the idea of the bigger size vs the Fuji Instax. I opened the box and set it up. First problem is the app. The camera just wont connect so I can use it as a printer. I liked the idea that I can use it as a printer and print pics on my phone, but unless I can connect the camera to phone, thats not happening. Now on to the prints. OMG they are horrible! I took a couple of shots and like that it wont print every picture I take, but I do want it to print the ones I want. I tried 3 times to print one picture. The camera starts making noise as if its printing and nothing comes out. I try again and like an idiot, Im looking at the slot to see if something comes out. Again, nothing! Third time was the charm and it was horrible. It was a simple picture of my Christmas tree. If this is truly a 20mp camera, I just dont see it. My phone takes better pictures. I was really excited about this camera until I used it. One star is generous, in my opinion. I really wanted to like this camera and have fun with it."^1^Dec 29, 2017 4:32 AM

MikeB^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-green/6090004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^3^"Good camera if you are looking for a point and shoot option that instantly prints. I would purchase additional packets of printing paper, as you get used to it you can really burn through the initial pack. It is not hard to begin using once the paper pack is inserted, there are really useful quick hints that support every feature. The camera allows for traditional photographs, GiFs and Video which I was surprised as the quality is pretty good and the audio as well, considering there is no visible microphone on the camera body. I plan on using this camera for the family photo album, as the iconic Polaroid pictures work well pined up on the wall and posted in a booklet. All in all I rate this camera pretty highly as it does everything an instant print camera should very well.

So far I'm really liking my purchase. I love being able to print classic Polaroid style images. There is also a cool edit feature that lets you choose different filters, frames, stickers and even draw if you want. I definitely suggest getting more paper, since once you start printing you're gonna want to print more, especially because you can connect your smart phone and print photos directly from you phone as well. I'm an adult and loving the camera's features but I can only imagine how fun this camera is for kids. There is something cool about the simplicity of a point and shoot and the vintage quality of being able to print that image instantly to give to friends or put on display.

beatbox360^/panasonic-dmc-fz1000-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/1206401?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^28^0^"This camera does a little of everything. It takes great photos, has a fairly long zoom, superfast focus, high burst rates, good battery life, and of course, it takes 4k video.

I bought this for that last caveat and I am not disappointed. The video is stunning on my 4k display, but even if you don't have a 4k display, the 4k video converted to 1080p looks better than video actually captured at 1080p. Also, the zoom is 25-400mm in 35mm equivalent, however during video it is increased To about 37-592mm which still gives an ok wide angle, while giving a really long zoom. Thankfully there is a really good optical image stabilization or the range would be a mess at the long end. I'm really pleased with the video quality and I'm glad I bought this over a similarly priced camcorder because of the larger sensor(better low light/indoor) and the added fun of taking stills. The quality of which are good enough that I'm considering selling my Canon dslr because I rarely make poster size prints, and even then, this camera could probably pull it off. Not to mention that the focus speed and burst rate put my Canon to shame. I love it.

I've included a picture grabbed from a 4k video. The video was taken from the top level at the back of very large auditorium during a program. To be clear, this photo is not an example of the photograpic capabilities of the camera, but rather a still frame representing video capabilities."^5^Apr 24, 2015 1:49 PM
Bobwhy4characters^/panasonic-dmc-fz1000-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/1206401?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^15^2^"Panasonic FZ1000 Review

Ergonomics and Useful Features
+ buttons are generally easy to find, near your fingers, and stand out from the body of the camera
+ secondary mode dial that gives instant access to Single Shot, Multiple Shot, Timer, Bracketing, and Itervalometer modes. Good job, Panasonic
- however, at times it is easy to accidently wander into the unknown - I found myself shooting at 2500 Kelvin or shooting at plus 1.5 EV because I accidently pressed some button(s)
+ Quick Menu button
+ Programmable Function buttons
+ 4 custom buttons
+ Automatic Viewfinder/Monitor changing (saves time and battery life)
- I prefer to have the red video button the back of the camera, not the top

Mechanical Issues
+ rapid fire in Burst Mode is brilliant
- auto focusing in Burst Mode is poor; it cannot follow an overhead bird in flight
- menu is vast and may take a while to find what you're looking for (a plague of many modern cameras#

Image Quality - I would have guess that the larger sensor and greater MegaPixel count would have put this camera above the other Point & Shoots. Not always so.

Daytime and sunshine - close distance to subject - acceptable to very good
Daytime and sunshine - far distance to subject - unacceptable to good
Daytime & overcast sky - acceptable to poor
Macro - Excellent
Night with tripod - excellent
Night hand-held - very good, but high ISO's

For General Use - family, pets, parties
+ good - I tend to be less critical in these situations. Here, you're more interested in subject matter than you are of the image quality. Many FZ1000 photos are soft and this softness increases on overcast days and with distance to the subject. Sharpness was best on subjects within 30feet or so. Saturation is good and exposure is a bit on the light side. The camera does an good job documenting everyday events. Software-adjusted photos look good on a large screen TV

Setting the metering mode to SPOT and setting i-resolution to HIGH sometimes helps image quality. Shooting photos in Aperture Mode #as opposed to Auto# typically didn't improve Image Quality

Lens suffers from sun flare and a lens hood would be a good addition

As a Travel Camera
+ 16X optical zoom is totally adequate for travel/vacations - you don't need a longer lens.
- this category could be combined with General Usage, but I want to point out that the camera is a bit bulky, making it conspicuous when trying to capture candid shots
- focal length only goes down to 25mm instead of the more useful 20mm found on other Panasonic Point & Shoot cameras such as the FZ70
+ otherwise, good photos with the limitations mentioned in the section above

Macro Photography
+ Excellent, good edge sharpness. The FZ1000 performs well in close up mode, as do all other Point & Shoot cameras

Night Photography with tripod
++ Amazingly good. I shot photos using Night Scene called Clear Nightscape #12, in the Scene Mode, with a tripod. I compared the photos from the FZ1000 to that of the small sensor ZS40/50 and the larger APS sensor from the Fuji X-T10. FZ100 photos are clear and sharp, showing good detail with good edges. Parallel lines in neon signs remained distinct whereas they blend together in the smaller format cameras. Shots from FZ1000, at least in my test shots, rivals those of my larger APS sensor camera! Good job, Panasonic.

It's odd that night photos seem so good and even better than many daylight photos.

Night Photography handheld, no tripod

I also did hand-held night shots using Scene #17 in the Scene Mode. This setting produced some good photos, but the camera pushed the ISO to 3200+ resulting in noise. Still, photos are acceptable and would adequately capture those shots where a tripod is not feasible, i.e. when traveling.

Wildlife
- Perplexing results - For wildlife photos, I check the animal's eye. If I can't get sharpness in the animal's eye, then the camera is a problem for me. I got inconsistent shots. If the subjects were physically close to me #within 25 feet# the FZ1000 did better. However, for longer shots, the smaller sensor ZS40 sometimes did better. This softness from the FZ1000 was not always correctible by software.

I suspect that in some of the photos, the camera was not focusing on what I was pointing at. For example, I found several pigeons on a wire. Oddly, pigeons BOTH to the left AND to right of the one I was targeting were in better focus than the one I was aiming at. Strange!

Flash
- Panasonic loves wimpy flashes, however, the flash on the FZ1000 is relatively decent and does well indoors. There is a flash compensation adjustment. In addition, you can add an external flash.

Digital Zoom#s#
The old adage is to never use digital zoom . However, in recent years, in-camera digital zoom has improved enormously, and if you have to use digital zoom, you won't be disappointed in the Panasonic FZ1000.
+ Intelligent zoom - up to 800mm - very good, little loss of information
+ Additional digital zoom - up to 1600mm - images are still acceptable

Manual Focusing
++ Sweet! The center of the screen enlarges the image and Focus Peaking drives the focus home. As with Auto focus, manual focusing does not seem to work well for distant objects nor for shaded/poor lit objects.

ISO
+ up to ISO800, photos are great
+ a photo of my cat in darkened garage at ISO 1250 was still acceptable after cropping, but this was pushing it. Night photos downtown were pushed to ISO 3200 but were still good

Special Effects or Creative Mode
+ I realize that these special effects can be added after the photos are downloaded on the computer, but don't be afraid to try them out. The One-Point Color is right on the money and the Impressive Art adds drama to the sky.

Scene Modes
- 6 people modes seems like overkill to me
- a food mode AND a dessert mode ? Who cares.
+/- hand-held Night Scene - acceptable
+ tripod Night Scene - excellent
+ Panorama Mode is oddly located in the Scene Mode, not on a mode dial

Missing features from the FZ1000

- EV dial on the body

- 20mm wide instead of 25mm - the much cheaper Panasonic FZ70 goes down to 20mm and this is great for travel - you can take a photo of a building without stepping back into the street

-aperture of f/16 or smaller for land and cityscapes

- Panorama Mode should be on the secondary mode dial, along with Single shot, Burst Mode, etc. modes.

- there should be a Glass Through mode on the scene dial, like other Panasonic cameras have. I use this mode a lot when photographing wildlife in the backyard.

Final Impressions:

#1# The FZ1000 produces good day-light images when the subject is close to the camera. Photos are good for general photography and travel, but weak for wildlife
#2# The camera is very good/great for tripod night photography
#3# The camera is full of great technology.
#4) camera is a bit heavy but ergonomically, it is easy to use and to change functions

Would be nice if the FZ1000 were a little wider and the lens a little faster (it's f2.8-f4 but it moves to f4 rather quickly when zoomed). The 400mm equiv. reach is what sold me over the Sony RX-10. Super customizable function buttons and really quick autofocus and startup. Great electronic viewfinder. Image quality is okay given the 1 inch sensor... not dslr quality but it's not a dslr. I'm no video guy but it seems pretty straightforward and other reviewers liked the 4k video function.

Although the 200 has a longer focal length and wider aperture, the FZ1000 is an equal in light gathering capability, in part due to the larger diameter lens..

If you need a spare battery, I recommend to purchase the original one. Because non-original battery was not decoded so the screen will not show the 'real' run time of its life.

mesess^/panasonic-dmc-fz1000-20-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/1206401?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Bought this camera shortly before taking a trip to the DC/Maryland/New York area so there wasn't much time to get comfortable with it but I have to say it was easy to get accustomed to the controls and ergonomics. At first it seems like a pretty large camera but it is actually really light and easy to carry when walking around. The convenience of not having to carry extra lenses also helped a great deal in that regard. My girlfriend is pretty small and has small hands and she was comfortable using it for long periods of time while walking around the city. She's also more of a beginner photographer so she spent most of her time on the auto modes but the photos came out great none the less. The 25-400mm reach is sufficiently wide angled while also giving you the zoom you need to capture details you might not have otherwise been able to. The image stabilization worked great and allowed for sharp pictures even when fully extended. One major concern with fixed lens long zoom cameras is the low-light performance but I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of this camera. I was able to walk around New York at night and photograph camera buildings, people, and even managed to take some pictures inside a nice restaurant thanks to the silent shutter feature. Performed really well at higher ISO for fixed lens without a fixed aperture. I'm still working on mastering the camera but from what I've seen this camera is a great buy especially in this price range. It's a great camera for travel due to its convenience and also accommodates both beginners and avid photographers alike. I would highly recommend this over other super zoom cameras in this price range and even some more expensive cameras."^5^Apr 9, 2016 10:19 AM

It provides a variety of automatic and manual settings. The zoom lens is sufficient for handling all of my photo needs. Now I do not have to carry around a variety of different lens. A minor drawback is that it makes a soft whirring sound that was not mentioned in any of the reviews I read but after googling the issue, I found that this is a common complaint with this camera. The sound is due to the 5 axis vibration stabilization system that is used. This can be an annoyance when taking videos in a quiet environment because it is picked up by the built-in mic. An external mic may solve the problem.

Techmaster^/canon-powershot-g9-x-20-2-megapixel-digital-camera-black/4608700?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^48^2^"My objective was a small camera that would deliver high quality photos at a reasonable price. I was able to get a super deal, lower than the sale price, so I bought the camera but even at the $449 price, it is still reasonable for a 1 inch sensor camera. With the great deal, I bought a 3 year extended warranty with accident protection and an extra battery. I also picked up a Lowerpro case which is just slightly bigger than the camera so it is still pockeable. I am an active amateur photographer but can't always bring my Canon SLR. I always like to have a camera with me besides my cell phone. My iPhone does a great job but there are times when you want or need a regular camera. This is the niche of the Canon 9GX. I was hesitant at first because many functions are accessible by touchscreen exclusively but it has not been a problem and in some ways it is easier to access the controls. 
The low light performance is excellent and is a rather bright lens at f2.8 but as you zoom in that does change. The photos are very sharp, good color accuracy, and vibrant. The videos are also excellent. I use mainly the P mode but I do use Shutter Priority and Aperture Priority every so often to achieve certain effects, For example, when photographing water such as a fountain, or stream and want to emphasis slow motion or stop motion I will set the shutter speed. I will use Aperture Priority to control depth of field. However, the camera does a good job of depth of field.
This camera in a small form factor gives you full manual control. The camera does not have a viewfinder or articulating screen which would have been an asset. I have had no trouble seeing the screen in bright sunlight and have also taken selfies as well. 
I highly recommend this camera. It delivers. If i had bought a bigger or heavier camera or more expensive that was not pocketable....it would be sitting home a lot.
I trusted this camera for my daughter' s wedding and small grandkids and I have gotten superior results. The upgrade to this is the Canon G7X Mark ii which is excellent, but still no viewfinder but it will set you back a few hundred dollars more and is bigger and heavier. I have used the camera too and I love it. It does edge out the Canon G9X but the G9X is excellent too. I also wanted an everyday camera that i could throw in my bag and by the time I added extended warranty and accessories to the G 7X Mark ii it would cost 1000 dollars and i could not justify that for an everyday camera. That is when I decided on the G9X which takes excellent photos and is smaller and lighter.The camera has a 3X zoom ratio which is adequate for everyday photography. I have used the digital zoom and was very surprised at the great results. I have other cameras with great zoom capabilty so it was not an issue for me.

I owned the first and second version of the RX100 and they're still working well and never an issue or repairs needed. It's a special camera to be sure. I'm fine with the menu system and the way Sony has laid their options out for many years. That said, a camera like this and with the 'power' and potential available... I'd happily take a 30-50% increase in mass to allow a more functional 'rear end' - with the addition of another control wheel or joystick and possibly another option for quick access to common settings to change while shooting. 
I've missed a few shots because of this but I blame me. I'm aware of the 'cons' (the extremely few that exist) and I should've anticipated, set up and would've been able to get the shot. I own a 5d mk4 as well, the original 5D before that as well as the first Canon 7D and recent upgrade to the mkII 
My wife, son and I love the outdoors and photography/videography is the perfect compliment to a day or a week in the woods of Alaska!
We all enjoy photography and video capture as hobbies and have recently learned to fly drones for a ver y cool perspective. 
As owners of smartphones (we're an Apple family and prefer iPhones) we often shoot with them and using or carrying the RX is nearly as convenient as throwing a smartphone in the pocket - but it's shots and it's abilities with both still and motion capture are as extensive as any DSLR. They're just tough to access at the right time sometimes. 

I've owned the model long enough to realize those special shots are best 'grabbed' using 'auto' or program as the intelligence of the ISP is phenomenal!! Awesome captures from auto mode and easily one of, if not, THE fastest camera I've ever shot!
In some of the fastest modes - you'll sacrifice resolution but not at the silly speeds advertised. They're REAL!! I'm floored sometimes with the speeds and tend to shoot with a lower setting as just a  second click'll net ya a dozen shots! 

Lastly the video capture is unbelievable quality for this small a package. The one inch sensor is massive in comparison to the current smartphone offerings and most small point and shoot cameras. Hence the expense. It's not cheap and if it's great photos you're after the V2-v4 models are still exceptional. And available at a LOT less cash. But I'm seriously impressed with the upgrades and continued bright lens and ability awesome files I'm continually getting from the camera and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to a beginner or professional alike as it's a lot lighter than the 5d4 w/70-200 and associated gear - yet the right conditions allow for 90-95% of the quality of the $5,000 DSLR -- and it fits in any pocket!"^5^Feb 1, 2017 8:11 PM

I have a tiny little case in my purse and it's always handy. I've been using it for a lot of macro shots and it blurs the background beautifully.

Mangino^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-v-21-0-megapixel-digital-camera/5655631?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^2^"I wanted something less bulky than my current DSLR but yet is very capable. So I decided on a compact. Compacts have come a long way over the last few years and the Mark V is a great example of an extremely capable compact camera. The picture quality is superb and has a plethora of features you normally only find on high end DSLR cameras. What really distinquishes the Mark V from all other current compacts is the 1' sensor with phase detection autofocus. It's currently the fastest and most accurate autofocus on the market for a compact (as of this review) and competes with high end DSLR cameras. 

If you're a pro currently using a DSLR and looking for an excellent compact to supplement or even replace your DSLR you should definitely give this camera a good hard look. And for the novice or experienced photographer that wants a camera that's less bulky yet easy to handle and operate but are not willing to sacrifice picture quality (like me) then this just might be the camera for you if it fits into your budget. 

I'm very happy with my purchase and look forward to many years of enjoyment with my Mark V."^5^Dec 15, 2016 9:00 PM

I can not distinguish the photograph between this and my 5D Mark III when shoot in daylight. When in dark, it can capture beautiful stars and even milky way, but the noise is noticeable since it only has a 1 inch sensor.

JustMyView^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-v-21-0-megapixel-digital-camera/5655631?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Overall, I am very pleased with the camera. Pictures are clear and it is so small it really does fit in my pocket. I take it out on walks or when heading some place with the kids. It works great for landscapes, flowers, sunsets etc. The focus system is great and it has lots of options, so the little bit of portrait and street shooting I have done has been easy. Using it for kids sports, the very fast frame rates makes it easy to 'spray and pray' and end up with decent shots. And I am only using the medium setting.

Of course, with a camera this size there are limitations. I have used it for photos of soccer and fencing, but the short reach on the lens is limiting. Same with wildlife - good pictures of deer in back yard or birds sitting still, but you can't get birds in flight or a rabbit at distance. The small size also means the controls are close together. Finally, it is not great in darker settings due to the one inch sensor. ISO pushes up high in those settings. The pictures you get in those darker situations are OK for a social media post or Christmas card small pic, but not outstanding. Shooting in RAW and post processing helps some, but it won't replace a much bigger, more expensive multi-lens camera. 

Despite the limitations, it is way easier to take along and I end up getting a lot more pics from it then from a bigger set up. And as my wife has said, the pictures blow away what we were getting from our Iphones."^5^Jun 4, 2018 11:02 AM
ZEUStheDJ^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-v-21-0-megapixel-digital-camera/5655631?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"First I use this mostly for vlogging so for this it is near perfect. Only gripe is that the mount hole on the bottom makes it impossible to put any type of mounting plate on it because it is directly next to the hinge of the battery door. There is a slight crop when using more than the standard (active and active+) stabilization in 1080p mode. You can only get basic stabilization in 4k but there is no crop which is good. Over heating is definitely an issue when shooting in 4k. Indicator light comes on around the 3 minute mark, and cap limit on 4k shooting is 5 minutes. Battery in 4k is bad too, so get an extra battery or two. Slow motion on this is dope, when used in the lower settings like 240fps or 480fps which looks ok in 1080p. Above that you are entering 480p-like video quality. Low light video quality surprised me for being a 1'sensor! 
For picture taking, the camera has good dynamic range but I'm not a photographer so don't take my word for it. I come from using the Sony A6300 and bought this for its compactness.

But at this price point you could get a much better value in getting a DSLR that you can grow with. The RX100v is super expensive for what it does but not for what it includes. What I mean by that is that it packs a ton of great stuff in it l like a viewfinder, ND filter, slow motion, etc. But at the end of the day what it does is takes pictures. $1k for just pictures and sometimes video is too pricey. A Honda gets you to Walgreens just as fast and safe as a BMW. And as usual the elephant in the room is 4k video. I don't have a single device in my home that can 'see' in 4k resolution. And I don't think I will for a few years. By that time there will be better and cheaper cameras than the RX100v.

No matter where you shop, the price isn't going to change. That said, with an expensive price comes a camera that's built with so many great features! From awesome photo quality to amazing video (4K). 

A few things I would mention to anyone considering getting this:

- It's a great camera! Hands down the best small camera out there right now. 
- I'm giving this four stars because it doesn't come with a user manual really and so you really need to learn a lot on your own. It's built with sooo many features that you really need to take some time to learn everything. I definitely recommend going online and watching videos on youtube and such. There's great stuff up there with expert photographer guidance.
- Shooting video in 4K will only give you about 5 minutes. Other video is as much time as you want, but with 4K you can only get about 5 minutes. It looks incredible though
- Definitely buy an extra battery or two especially if you are traveling!! I bought this before going to Asia and it was so helpful!

MaizeNBlue^/sony-cyber-shot-rx100-v-21-0-megapixel-digital-camera/5655631?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"I think it's the best pocket camera due to the slow motion and regular video capabilities. I debated on the LX10 but it peaks at 120p and even then it limits settings. I use high frame rate mode quite a bit, mainly for fun family videos, and whereas the RX100IV missed focus in that mode the V seems to still keep everything in focus. 

As for the regular camera features, it works fine. I don't think there is much separating the 1-inch sensors photo quality wise (other than your preference for colors). 

Not a fan of the menu system for Sony's, apps for example aren't very intuitive and a hassle, but again there's nothing that compares to it in my opinion so I gave it the best rating I could.

I do still shoot some digital and bought this camera as a light and small carry alternative to a larger full frame digital Leica I have been using for years. 

What I like about the RX100V: Very fast and accurate AF, exceptional image considering sensor size, versatile viewing screen plus popup viewfinder, size, available lens lengths and lens speed.

What I do not like: Very unintuitive interface and menu system. I like to have control at times when using this camera even though I bought it mainly as a nice point and shoot - however when I do want control the poor interface gets in the way. If this was my one and only camera I am sure it would become second nature in time, but having used both Leica and Nikon digital before I retired from the photography profession, I know you can still have a wide range of capabilities with an intuitive interface.

I like the other features - the GIF was pretty cool. 

My nephew enjoyed the cool animation that played while printing was going on. Cool little video

I LOVE!!! That you can write on the camera screen with your finger. Same as you would using a sharpie on the picture itself. Can even add a border. Very cool feature. 

Will update the review after I have some more time to play with this. So far, very impressed. Added some quick prints from my phone."^5^Oct 9, 2017 5:54 PM

I was so excited to buy this and get it home and try it out, and now I've had it for TWO DAYS, and it wont turn back on. I used it yesterday, and this morning, tried to turn it on again about an hour later and got nothing. Plugged it in because maybe the battery died? Nope. Left it on the charge for 5 hours, and nothing. It still won't turn on. The camera quality is bad, which is to be expected from the product description, so I was expecting that, and it didn't even bother me, until the camera stopped working altogether. The picture shows what results I get wheb I hold down the power button (big surprise: NOTHING).Do yourself a favor, and dont get this. You'll save yourself a lot of disappointment and time of having to return it."^1^Nov 8, 2017 3:49 PM

Dont expect it to replace your dslr but it is great for spontaneous gatherings and impromptu fun.

lyndsie^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-white/6090000?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^1^"saying that it is easy to turn the polaroid pop into a printer for your phone is literally the most wrong description of this product. I have been trying to connect my phone to the camera through the polaroid pop app for almost 5 hours. Even loading the paper took me so long because I thought you had to push the paper in all the way and for the longest time the camera kept reading that it was out of paper. LUCKILY I stumbled upon a discussion that states you have to put the paper ALMOST all the way in for it to be sensed by the camera. There is not one thing in the 'user manual' that even talks about that. who would've known that automatically? The camera comes with something they call a 'user manual' in reality all it is, is a quick start up guide that is very, very vague. It gives you no information on connecting the camera to your phone through wifi and the app which is probably the most complicated aspect of this camera. I tried calling their 1800 technical support number and it is closed until January 2, what type of 1800 isn't 24/7/365? especially when Im sure they would be the busiest since so many people probably bought this product for Christmas. For the $200 it would probably be in your best interest to just buy a portable printer and a cheap grade instant camera. Also if you're someone who googles for answers, good luck trying to find any answer on how to set this thing up. They're non existant. I did get ahold of the geek squad but the had to apologize because there was not one suggestion they could give me to help except wait until the polaroid tech support opens on jan 2. I really hope this saves atleast one person from the utter frustration that this instant camera is."^2^Dec 30, 2017 7:33 PM

I loved the fact that it was digital so you got to review the film before you printed it and the quality stated it was 20 megapixels! What else could you want out of an instant film camera right? Wrong! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The quality of the prints were so bad compared to my $99 Fujifilm Camera. It was so bad I thought I bought a defective one.

Got a prompt no hassle exchange from Best Buy. Produces a picture similar to the old Polaroid, only better quality, quicker, no waiting to develop. Much more compact than the old Polaroids. Can put it in a jacket pocket. Would like it better if it filled the paper. Adding writing underneath with your finger difficult, useless. In addition to the larger print size, this camera has the advantage over the Polaroid Snap Touch in that it lets you know frames remaining for your film, and frames remaining on your Micro SD card. Doesn't have rapid fire pictures like Snap Touch, but it does do GIFs. Very happy with it, friends seeing it want to know, 'Where can I get one.' 'Best Buy' of course. The advantage of this camera and Snap Touch over other instant print cameras is it's digital, you don't have to waste film on bad shots, or you can print many of a good one. With the LCD what you see is what you get, no view finder error."^4^Mar 9, 2018 9:41 PM

I liked the idea of the bigger size vs the Fuji Instax. I opened the box and set it up. First problem is the app. The camera just wont connect so I can use it as a printer. I liked the idea that I can use it as a printer and print pics on my phone, but unless I can connect the camera to phone, thats not happening. Now on to the prints. OMG they are horrible! I took a couple of shots and like that it wont print every picture I take, but I do want it to print the ones I want. I tried 3 times to print one picture. The camera starts making noise as if its printing and nothing comes out. I try again and like an idiot, Im looking at the slot to see if something comes out. Again, nothing! Third time was the charm and it was horrible. It was a simple picture of my Christmas tree. If this is truly a 20mp camera, I just dont see it. My phone takes better pictures.

I would purchase additional packets of printing paper, as you get used to it you can really burn through the initial pack. It is not hard to begin using once the paper pack is inserted, there are really useful quick hints that support every feature. The camera allows for traditional photographs, GiFs and Video which I was surprised as the quality is pretty good and the audio as well, considering there is no visible microphone on the camera body. I plan on using this camera for the family photo album, as the iconic Polaroid pictures work well pined up on the wall and posted in a booklet. All in all I rate this camera pretty highly as it does everything an instant print camera should very well.

There is also a cool edit feature that lets you choose different filters, frames, stickers and even draw if you want. I definitely suggest getting more paper, since once you start printing you're gonna want to print more, especially because you can connect your smart phone and print photos directly from you phone as well. I'm an adult and loving the camera's features but I can only imagine how fun this camera is for kids. There is something cool about the simplicity of a point and shoot and the vintage quality of being able to print that image instantly to give to friends or put on display.

It is definitely worth having as an adventurer who loves documenting vacations and road trips for Instagram. I would have to say a good Polaroid picture definitely brings in the likes. It even allows you to send photos to social media through the Pop app. Social media aside, I love the easy point and shoot ability and faster turnover time from one picture printed to being able to take another. This is essentiall when on road trips where fast paced action cant be stopped for the perfect photo. The Pop is ready for the spontaneity of life."^5^Oct 11, 2017 3:26 PM
MikeB^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-yellow/6090003?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^3^"Good camera if you are looking for a point and shoot option that instantly prints. I would purchase additional packets of printing paper, as you get used to it you can really burn through the initial pack. It is not hard to begin using once the paper pack is inserted, there are really useful quick hints that support every feature. The camera allows for traditional photographs, GiFs and Video which I was surprised as the quality is pretty good and the audio as well, considering there is no visible microphone on the camera body. I plan on using this camera for the family photo album, as the iconic Polaroid pictures work well pined up on the wall and posted in a booklet. All in all I rate this camera pretty highly as it does everything an instant print camera should very well.
 
I have seen the smaller printers and really like the size of these prints. Others are fun but it is nice having a pocket size print."^5^Oct 11, 2017 3:09 PM

So far I'm really liking my purchase. I love being able to print classic Polaroid style images. There is also a cool edit feature that lets you choose different filters, frames, stickers and even draw if you want. I definitely suggest getting more paper, since once you start printing you're gonna want to print more, especially because you can connect your smart phone and print photos directly from you phone as well. I'm an adult and loving the camera's features but I can only imagine how fun this camera is for kids. There is something cool about the simplicity of a point and shoot and the vintage quality of being able to print that image instantly to give to friends or put on display.

I have the original snap touch, which I loved but this is so much cooler. The pictures are double the size and have the Classic Polaroid Frame. The printing is quite smooth and I think the quality is much better than on older cameras. 

I like the other features - the GIF was pretty cool. 

My nephew enjoyed the cool animation that played while printing was going on. Cool little video

I LOVE!!! That you can write on the camera screen with your finger. Same as you would using a sharpie on the picture itself. Can even add a border. Very cool feature.

I used it yesterday, and this morning, tried to turn it on again about an hour later and got nothing. Plugged it in because maybe the battery died? Nope. Left it on the charge for 5 hours, and nothing. It still won't turn on. The camera quality is bad, which is to be expected from the product description, so I was expecting that, and it didn't even bother me, until the camera stopped working altogether. The picture shows what results I get wheb I hold down the power button (big surprise: NOTHING).Do yourself a favor, and dont get this.

lyndsie^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-pink/6090001?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^1^"saying that it is easy to turn the polaroid pop into a printer for your phone is literally the most wrong description of this product. I have been trying to connect my phone to the camera through the polaroid pop app for almost 5 hours. Even loading the paper took me so long because I thought you had to push the paper in all the way and for the longest time the camera kept reading that it was out of paper. LUCKILY I stumbled upon a discussion that states you have to put the paper ALMOST all the way in for it to be sensed by the camera. There is not one thing in the 'user manual' that even talks about that. who would've known that automatically? The camera comes with something they call a 'user manual' in reality all it is, is a quick start up guide that is very, very vague. It gives you no information on connecting the camera to your phone through wifi and the app which is probably the most complicated aspect of this camera. I tried calling their 1800 technical support number and it is closed until January 2, what type of 1800 isn't 24/7/365? especially when Im sure they would be the busiest since so many people probably bought this product for Christmas. For the $200 it would probably be in your best interest to just buy a portable printer and a cheap grade instant camera. Also if you're someone who googles for answers, good luck trying to find any answer on how to set this thing up. They're non existant. I did get ahold of the geek squad but the had to apologize because there was not one suggestion they could give me to help except wait until the polaroid tech support opens on jan 2. I really hope this saves atleast one person from the utter frustration that this instant camera is."^2^Dec 30, 2017 7:33 PM

I loved the fact that it was digital so you got to review the film before you printed it and the quality stated it was 20 megapixels! What else could you want out of an instant film camera right? Wrong! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The quality of the prints were so bad compared to my $99 Fujifilm Camera. It was so bad I thought I bought a defective one. I actually went back to BestBuy exchanged it for another brand new one and the quality was still complete ****. It shocks me that this product has ONLY positive reviews.

Dwight^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-pink/6090001?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Didn't give it a four because the first one I got didn't work. Got a prompt no hassle exchange from Best Buy. Produces a picture similar to the old Polaroid, only better quality, quicker, no waiting to develop. Much more compact than the old Polaroids. Can put it in a jacket pocket. Would like it better if it filled the paper. Adding writing underneath with your finger difficult, useless. In addition to the larger print size, this camera has the advantage over the Polaroid Snap Touch in that it lets you know frames remaining for your film, and frames remaining on your Micro SD card. Doesn't have rapid fire pictures like Snap Touch, but it does do GIFs. Very happy with it, friends seeing it want to know, 'Where can I get one.' 'Best Buy' of course. The advantage of this camera and Snap Touch over other instant print cameras is it's digital, you don't have to waste film on bad shots, or you can print many of a good one. With the LCD what you see is what you get, no view finder error."^4^Mar 9, 2018 9:41 PM
Evrosado^/polaroid-pop-20-0-megapixel-digital-camera-pink/6090001?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^3^"So I did research and found mixed reviews for the Polaroid Pop camera. I liked the idea of the bigger size vs the Fuji Instax. I opened the box and set it up. First problem is the app. The camera just wont connect so I can use it as a printer. I liked the idea that I can use it as a printer and print pics on my phone, but unless I can connect the camera to phone, thats not happening. Now on to the prints. OMG they are horrible! I took a couple of shots and like that it wont print every picture I take, but I do want it to print the ones I want. I tried 3 times to print one picture. The camera starts making noise as if its printing and nothing comes out. I try again and like an idiot, Im looking at the slot to see if something comes out. Again, nothing! Third time was the charm and it was horrible. It was a simple picture of my Christmas tree. If this is truly a 20mp camera, I just dont see it. My phone takes better pictures. I was really excited about this camera until I used it. One star is generous, in my opinion. I really wanted to like this camera and have fun with it."^1^Dec 29, 2017 4:32 AM

I wanted so badly for this camera to work but it simply doesnt. I think they should recall this product and start over. I ended up getting a Fuji camera and printer.

I recently purchased the Canon G7X Mark ii and in the Short Few Days i was able to use it i Liked it alot, but on the Day the Canon M50 Mirrorless Came out i went into my local Best buy to check it out,it was limited quantity and not on display i asked to see what it looked like and read up on all the specs i knew i wanted it, so i Exchanged my G7X for the M50,for the Extra money that i put toward the M50 i was able to get some Cool Features Software and Hardware Wise. I love the Fact that i have options now for Other Lenses, the stock Lense with IS works Great. Auto Focus with more Points is also a Plus. The Body of the Camera with out the Lense feels a bit plastic and i was concerned at first unboxing even compared to the way the G7X tough Build felt but as soon as i put the M50 Lense on it didn't matter as much and also helps in Making this Camera Compact and lightweight. In Hands the M50 Feels Very Comfortable in my Opinion. I know there are Complaints about th 4K Crop but i did not care and would much rather shoot in 1080p and have no use for 4K. I Purchased this Camera for Quality Photos and Ease of Transfering to Smartphone to Social Media and It does exactly that with the Canon Connect app and the new Auto Transfer Feature is Pretty cool. The Photo Quality is Crisp and Vibrant and some Great Features such as Background Blurring, built in Filters etc... One Great Hardware Feature is Having the Hi resolution EVF (ElectronicViewFinder) it's Beautiful and fluid to work with and an Awesome Feature for Bright days when the LCD can Give some Glare. I could go on about other cool Features but i will conclude with this, for the Price i know you can get a Full Size DSLR but if you're looking for Compactbuild,QualityPhotos,GreatVideos, interchangable Lenses, and all around Fun to Use Camera You won't Be disappointed i know im Definitely not and i made the Right choice."^5^Apr 6, 2018 2:36 AM

But this isn't all about the specs for me, its very easy to use and just pick up and go but still has the options to adjust and change what you need.

- size and form - This is probably smaller then some of you may want but if your looking for something small and the still feels sturdy. I like this camera and I wish they made a battery grip for it. Now this fits my hands good and will be going every where I can take it which is a lot because its much smaller then others I have.

- features - The flip screen is a full touch screen and it works great, this cameras screen is sensitive and works when you touch to focus or select in the menus. Auto focus works great I never really worry about it finding my face or not being in focus and if I want to check the screen flips out to adjust from all sides! I think there are some that won't like the menus and button layout but for the quick little shooter I wanted the auto select knob for present makes it very fast and easy to not search around for things on screen, then in each of those there are very easy on screen menus that pop up with out having to leave the screen your looking at the photo or video with. Now there is some custom feature and great shooting modes like RAW + jpeg and its got wifi and bluetooth, that will link to my phone for cool viewing through your cell phone to use the camera even if your not beside it. This comes in very handy and makes things like taking a quick review photo moving it to my phone or laptop , editing it then posting or using that photo where ever I need it.

- lens selection- this is where the camera with this m mount miss out a little bit and I wish they made a lot more native lenses for this camera, but it doesn't get knocked down because you can get an adapter and use your other EF and EF-s lenses. So that gives it a great selection to choose from and even the EF-M lens are pretty good that I have tried so far and keep it small and light weight! 

- battery life- I might get on here and say the full amount by the shot or hour it does but I haven't had time to test it so far and I just got an extra battery and I don't have problems with it dying very fast. Along with that these are also small and easy to take so you can just throw your extra in any pocket on your bag or back pack and it should fit.

- Photo and video - Im not going to get technical with this because its just a review for people looking to buy and if you want specs and things go to you tube. But this camera to me takes great video right out of the box even with the kit lens. On top of taking great video the photos are really good as well and it does much better in low light then I thought it would! But I'm pretty sure its got the Digic 8 processor which is a bit newer then some out right now so that probably helps. The photos have been pretty easy to use and edit along with being able to set the video the way you want it on the camera most the time and not having to edit in post much to get it looking good. 

One bad but doesn't matter to me the 4k has not got the same auto focus as the 1080 but it still has some type of focus, but it still works and I think some would be happy with this all I can say is the colors looked good when I tried it. But I would test this out for your self and for me right now the 4k takes up way to much space and the 1080 looks great with this little thing to me. 

Now for pros I can't say get it for sure but I wouldn't over look it just because of others saying bad things about the 4k or something sill because its so easy to use and fun on top off that and last but most important of all it has a great price I think most people can afford and will make me feel much safer with being rough on it because I know the body of the camera doesn't cost crazy amounts to replace! 

Either way I like it and would recommend you guys at least check it out and it would be a good back up and travel camera as well.

I originally shoot with a Nikon D850 and am very comfortable with DSLR's of the professional kind. I do want to mention that this camera has a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor which means it is a cropped sensor. The fact that this is mirror-less means it is amazing for videos. Mirror-less cameras are made to be smaller and lighter and generally better for video. The facts that the camera has Canon's amazing DPAF (Dual Pixel Auto-Focus), makes this great for focusing on faces blazing fast. This camera albeit small and compact, has some downfalls. My review is solely based on my experience with editing videos and pictures. I usually like to shoot 4K since I do a lot of nature shoots, I want to give this an honest review. First and foremost, it has a pretty great stabilizer for walking and filming. Shooting at 1080p 60 fps, you can get some nice smooth slow motion shots when edited in post. The lens that it comes with is a 15-45 mm which is not the best in my opinion for photography or videos, it is a great introductory camera for any beginner to enjoy and the ease of use makes it that much better. Now for the 4k video, it does have a crop factor and only shoots at 24 fps. 24 fps gives it a pretty nice cinematic look but the crop factor is what kind of ruins it. It has a 1.7x crop which means that you're gonna need a wide angle lens in order to get a bigger picture (Downside- This camera uses special lenses and there isn't a huge variety out there). The other downside is that at 4K, it loses the DPAF that I mentioned above. At 720p you can shoot up to 120fps which means SUPER SLOW MOTION... Which is awesome in my opinion. You do lose some resolution but anyone getting introduced into the DSLR world, this is the way to go. It isn't a 1DX Mark II, or a Sony Alpha 7R II, but you get what you pay for and get some great quality videos and pictures. I immediately took it off what I like to call 'beginner mode' and start shooting in manual. But I perused beginner mode and it was very user friendly. I'd definitely look into this if you want to get into the awesome world of DSLR's. I know There's a lot of key points I missed but when I look at reviews what I mentioned above is what I mostly look for just to keep it short and sweet. I'm also not going to scrutinize it and compare it to a professional camera worth thousands of dollars. I knew what I was getting myself into so I'd definitely recommend this to a newcomer."^5^May 9, 2018 1:07 AM

Well, I pulled the trigger yesterday, as an addition to my Canon family. I have the 70D, 80D and now the M50.
This little guy is a midget 80D, for the most part, and then you add 4K Video and also the Time-Lapse Movie.
It is easy to setup, the IQ is awesome, on a par with my other 2-bodies.
It feels very good in my hands, and is solid build, for use as a travel camera.
I also bought the COMMLITE ADAPTER for EF to M for I have about 7 other lenses that will work now.
The menu's are very similar to the larger DSLR's by Canon. 
I do not believe that the battery is as bad as people say, but I also purchased 2 for backups.
Video is excellent, 1080P at 60 fps or 720P at 120 fps. I have not checked 4K, as I have no need at this time, but I am sure that a 10-18 mm lens will solve the cropping problem. Overall, this is a monster of a small camera, and I believe that if you try it, you'll like it also."^5^Oct 6, 2018 6:59 PM

It fits neatly in a small Case Logic camera bag which tucks neatly into my back pack.

Major pluses are the APS-C sensor (bigger than most point and shoots), the ability to shoot RAW, the excellent touch screen, the bright electronic view finder, the well organized menu and the ability to customize the camera's operation.

I hope that this will be a start to the more high-end Mirrorless Camera, but you have to start somewhere. I was happy to have gotten this camera because I had no idea that this was an $899.99 Mirrorless Camera. I would have had no way of getting if I waited for a 1 more week.

EVERYTHING else about this camera makes it the best value for exactly what I need - a lightweight, mirrorless (WITH a viewfinder!!) camera with excellent photo and video specs, a great kit lens, a side-oriented viewing screen that doesn't interfere with any other function of the camera, an external mic jack, enough valuable accessories to make up for anything that other reviewers have found lacking (they are comparing this camera to others that cost hundreds if not thousands more, which amplifies the value of this camera that much more!!), outrageously good auto-focus, and the perfect video specs allowing me to make high quality videos that I plan to turn into DVDs to sell as part of my presentations. I need 1080p60fps and this camera does that brilliantly! I love this camera!!

The selling point was a full, well, vari-angle (rotational) touchscreen - the M3 only had limited moveability with the touchscreen. Another selling point was the viewfinder. Honestly, it was the MAIN reason why I purchased this camera because as an original user of the Nikon D70s, I am fairly old fashioned when it comes to shooting. I love a good viewfinder but I also love to have the capability to shoot using the screen. So, I appreciated that the M50 had this feature. And lastly, it has the ability to record/shoot in 4K. Those 3 features alone had me SOLD. 

It's only been a couple of months, and though I am still learning my way around the camera, I am very pleased. It is easy to use (even has the option to turn on and off tips). It shoots clearly. Has the ability to use traditional canon lenses with the addition of an adapter. I'll really get to test out its muscle power on my upcoming trip to Puerto Rico and see how well the battery life fairs because I did read reviews that the battery life is not as strong as it is in other models. So, while I am abroad, I'll see how well it fairs. Outside of that, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this model to anyone looking for something lighter and smaller but with full capabilities of a traditional DSLR. It's also a great camera for beginners dabbling in the art of photography but wants something a bit more powerful than a normal point and shoot camera."^5^May 16, 2019 10:28 AM

One note - if you are using this for the 4K video - look elsewhere as this doesnt shoot 4k as well as other cameras on the market. 

The strength of this camera is its size, cost and the ability to take great pictures. Its a great starter DSLR as well as priced just right. Better than the SL2 and since its mirrorless if you have other Canon lens - I would say buy the adapter.

If you are good with shooting in 1080p - this camera will work great for those that want to get into vlogging. Regardless of if you want to take pics or shoot video this is great camera."^5^Mar 8, 2019 4:54 PM

With the discount, the Canon EOS M50 is a good value for those seeking an entry-level camera. Although it is not fully competitive with some more expensive mirrorless APS-C cameras, it is a capable, compact camera which produces very good results. It has many advanced features that can be used by more experienced photographers, but these are mostly embedded in the menus. Its primary weakness, given the mirrorless competition, is that it lacks in-body image stabilization and does not have as many lens choices as some other mirrorless manufacturers. Nevertheless, it is a very good entry-level camera. For the future, it would be good to see Canon and Nikon get more serious about mirrorless camera products. Overall, they seem to be lagging behind the competition in this market."^4^Jul 21, 2018 6:38 PM

The LCD screen on the Canon M50 can flip to The front. To use the flash feature, you manually need to flip the lens light up; this featured should be automatic.

Brian^/sony-alpha-a6400-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/6324856?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^17^3^"I shot on Nikon for years before moving into Sony mirrorless.

I currently own an a6000 and an a7ii and am very familiar with them. I was looking for something to shoot video with (specifically YouTube and interview videos) so I liked that this didnt have the 30 minute limit. I had no clue how many advances had been made since the a6000 was released. I try to avoid new camera info because it always leads to me getting excited and buying one.

The flip up screen is great and I love being able to monitor myself while recording. I know you can always add a monitor to other cameras (I even own one) but when I have a video idea I want to get it going as quickly. That means I usually forgo looking for the monitor and hoping Im in the shot correctly.

The videos have come out INCREDIBLE so far and Im beyond happy with the purchase. The only thing Im not excited for is re-configuring all of my custom buttons and menus but thats the case with any new camera and if thats my biggest issue then life is pretty good :)

If you own an a6000 or are looking for a camera that does both video and photography really well then definitely give this a good, hard look.

If you're sitting there with an a6300 or a6500 then the decision to upgrade (or is it sidegrade?) is a little trickier. Go to a camera store and test it out... if you love the a6300 then youll absolutely love this camera but if you have the a6300 then you most likely dont *need* this camera. If that makes any sense."^5^Mar 7, 2019 2:45 PM
Stan^/sony-alpha-a6400-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/6324856?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"The A6400 replaced an A6000, which I was very pleased with.  I upgraded to the A6400 because of the advances in AF, mainly the addition of tracking and both human and animal eye focus.  The animal eye focus feature does, at this point, require a simple online firmware update.

The pros with this camera are its compact size and light weight, its excellent Sony APS-C sensor, very usable EVF, very good low light performance, and overall fine image quality.  That, plus the advanced AF features, make for a formidable little camera.

The downside is that it may be too small for larger hands, and definitely does not balance well with larger, heavier lenses.  Although improved, Sony menus are not what I would call intuitive.  The manual that comes with the camera is very basic, and really leaves much to the new owner to figure things out.  Also, as with most mirrorless designs, battery life is relatively poor.

So, if you're looking for a carry camera that doesnt require a padded shoulder strap because of its weight, and want the image quality of an APS-C sensor, the A6400 may be a perfect fit.  Just expect to spend some time with the menus, and a lot of time online figuring out how to set it up so you can take advantage of its many features."^4^Aug 9, 2019 4:02 PM

It will also has no recording limit and does not overheat as fast as the a6500. It may last 5 to 6 times longer than the a6500 before it shuts down about 2-2.5 hrs. I had 2 Canon 70d and had the a6300. although the a6300 had the continuous eye AF in photos it did not match Canons dual pixel AF in video.

Wanted one that would provide excellent focus and 4k video. The 6400 was a lot less money than I was willing to spend, which allowed me to get more lenses and a gimbal and still spent less than many other brands or models. Such a great value.

Once my wife and I started to take pictures and video, I found the camera went way beyond expectations for this price point. 10 frames per second of fast moving objects and found 95% perfect focus on what should have been in focus.

Fairly easy to get around on, and when in a rush the auto modes worked great. I find this is not the case for the 6400. Shooting at a live concert rehearsal, I found the auto modes brightened the image way too much. Fortunately, I had the time during the rehearsal to get good settings in manual mode and get some nice shots at the actual concert. Very pleased with shots of fireworks this July 4th as well. Once you realize that Sony's auto mode is a bit overdone (maybe it's just my camera?) and work the camera in manual mode, you'll have to weigh if it's right for you. Be aware, as many reviews I read attest, the Sony menu system is a learning experience. 

As for me, I love the camera, albeit I do wish the auto modes were tweaked better. I'm shooting with the 18-200 zoom and the 50/1.8. I'd recommend skipping the kit lens, as the one I have for the NEX-6 was never on the camera."^4^Jul 12, 2019 5:41 PM

Not because it was perfect but rather because I saw where it was going and its potential. Coming fronm the Canon 6D, everything was just smaller, the feature set was more robust, and I knew that mirrorless was the future of photography so I decided to become an early adopter.
 The biggest issues I had with the A7ii model was the slow autofocus speeds as compared to the A7Rii, the lack of continuous eye autofocus, and a single memory card slot. Sure, there were a few minor others, but nothing that I couldn't live with. Fast forward three years to the announcement of the A7iii; Sony literally fixed EVERY problem I had with the a7ii...and then some.
 Is this a perfect camera? No, that doesn't exist. Is it close to the perfect camera for me? Yes, indeed! I don't need the 42 megapixels of the A7Riii. I don't need the low-light capabilities of the soon-to-be-released A7Siii. The A9 is a great camera but the benefits of the superior buffer speeds and frames per second just don't warrant the $4K price tag, for my use. The A7iii is the sweet spot between them all!
 The autofocus system was borrowed from the A9 and is super fast and reliable. It now has two memory card slots making event photography more of an option than in the previous generations. It now has continuous eye autofocus. Its like Sony was with me through every gripe and complaint of the A7ii. The price point is just right, the feature set beats all competitors in its class, and it makes shooting fun. With the addition of the previously missing feature sets, I can now spend more time taking photos and focusing in on composition and creativity. I love it!
 Now, the bad. The electronic view finder (EVF) is a bit worse than the A7ii's EVF. it was noticeable at first glance but not a deal breaker. The buffer won't clear as fast as the A9 making the silent shooting mode a moot point in LED lighting (due to banding issues) and the resolution is almost half of what is possible on the A7Riii. And...that's all! Literally. I cannot find any other reason to give pause to purchasing this camera. So much so that I bought a second one as a backup for my event photography. With that said, why are you still here reading this!?! Go buy the A7iii and get out there and start taking great photos. Happy shooting my friend!"^5^Jun 21, 2018 6:20 AM

When Sony came up with NEX 7 more than 5 years ago, it was a head turner in terms of design and image quality. A really small camera can produce image and 1080p video that is good if not better than other APS-C cameras of its generation. The A7 series live up to the expectation with one important upgrade: full frame sensor. Coming to the third iteration of the A7 series, Sony not just give you the best bang for the buck it is now already a mature system with full options of lens line up and accessories.

Compare that to Nikon and Canon, they are just becoming more serious in the mirrorless game. But the true and tried is Sony and the camera for the general purpose shooting is the Sony A7 iii. 

The camera feels and looks good. It is a solid camera in terms of design and portability. 

Image quality is great, enjoy it with your 4K screen so you can realize how good it is. Noise control, sharpness and color is pleasing. Dynamic range is great, the camera is able to capture some really complex lighting conditions. Low light performance is great, will likely to turn heads of Canon 5D series owners. High ISO feels useful not just some gimmicks though you may want to limit shooting above iso 6400. 

Menu customization is great and well structured. Compatibility to Sony A-mount lens is available through a separate mount adapter and it works great although you're going to waste the A7 iii auto focus system by using the adapter's AF system. 

Kit lens is not bad. It is actually good for the money. If you compare it with the Zeiss F/4 lens of the same focal length, you will appreciate your kit lens more as there are not a few people keeping their kit lens rather than getting the Zeiss lens due to insignificant image quality differences between these lenses.

Video quality is also great and options for great video lens are there. You can buy cheaper APS-C power zoom lens, which works great for A7 iii video. No 4K 60fps but that is okay because that is the standard 4K framerate nowadays. Video is still limited to not exceed 30 minutes per clip. Built-in microphone is okay but most people will eventually use external mic anyway if they are serious about their video. One feature that no Canon and Nikon give you even with their newest mirrorless camera that they just announced: dual slot cards. This gives you another layer of security so you know that your image will not get corrupted due to some memory card error. You can also assign the first slot to take JPEG and the second slot to take RAW.

Transferring image from camera to computer and even to smartphones are easy. The app works well.

For those of you who consider getting the A7R iii or A7 iii, the former does give you more resolution. If you have tons of APSC E mount lens, it does more make sense to get the A7R iii because the A7 iii will automatically crop your image to 10mpix while A7Riii will give you several more mpix. When you come to think of it, even with the cropped 10mpix image that can make good quality A4 size prints.

A7 III is a good investment that will last you years."^5^Sep 10, 2018 5:14 PM

I picked up this kit as a replacement and I could not be happier! The build quality feels great. The EVF and rear screen could be better, but I do not feel that they detract from this camera at all. Battery life is insane, I have been setting this camera up over the past few hours while taking about 200 test shots and I am currently at 99%.

The autofocus system is literally INSANE, I cannot believe how fast and accurate it is, even in terrible light with a kit lens. I have pretty big hands, so I did need to buy the battery grip for this camera to be comfortable, but having the extra battery is going to be amazing. I have been shooting Canon primarily for the past 10 years and now I see why everyone is jumping ship and moving to Sony. I never thought I would love another camera enough to give up my 5D Mark IV, but this camera is a game changer. I cannot wait to see what Sony has in store for their future cameras and lenses. Don't hesitate, buy this camera, I promise you won't be disappointed."^5^Jan 29, 2019 7:01 PM

Little did I know that this impulse buy was the start of a Sony Love affair! 

I stalked my local Best buy for months until I finally scored the A7III with 28-70mm lens. While I didn't originally want the kit lens I was just desperate to get my hands on the camera so I bought the kit. I have been pleasantly surprised with the sharpness of the this kit lens and it makes a nice walk around lens. 

I was in need of full frame, image stabilization and the low light capabilities for my professional/client work and the A7III is perfect for me! I shoot a broad variety of subjects and dabble in video so the need for a camera with versatility is a must.

The features I love with Sony are size of camera for my small hands, the Eye AF and the continuous focus tracking is so much better then I had on my Canon gear."^5^Dec 4, 2018 10:32 AM

This mirrorless camera is incredible, the autofocus is lightning fast, unmatchable by Cannon or Nikon. The EYE-AF is nuts! IT works so incredibly well and really helps in both video and stills. The menu systems are very complex and hard to get used to, but that's just part of the learning curve. The only thing I would note is how much more expensive Sony Glass seems to be compared to my Nikon ones.

After returning to BB, I spoke with a very knowledgeable young sales lady and we discussed both cameras and she indicated the images from the Canon and Sony were comparable outdoors, but indoors, the Sony was much better. After a few weeks of use, I agree and would recommend this.

It was quite a bit more expensive than the M50, but if you're not happy with the quality of the pictures, I was willing to spend the additional on the A6400.

Sony cameras in general caught my eye because of how easy the software on them is to navigate in addition to how nice they look. I originally decided to settle on the Sony a5100 because of the flip screen, kid you not the day I went to purchase Sony announced the release of the 6400 and I decided to wait.

I am pleasantly surprised how this camera does in low light. Ive taken a keeper for insta at 16000 iso. 

One thing I do not like is that there is no in camera timelapse video. There is interval shooting built into the camera. On the a6000 with the playmemories app it would make a video file as well as raw images. Now it takes a little more time to convert raw image to timelapse video on the computer. 

One of my favorite things about this camera is silent shooting. Keep in mind at higher shutter speed or fast moving subjects there can be rolling shutter in the image. However I use this feature when doing timelapse with a slow shutter speed.

The 6100L is not likely going to attract professional photographers, but it is not intended to. The 6100L is for everyone else!

With a stellar array of features and functionality, and excellent specifications, this mirrorless, interchangeable lens camera is terrific. The 6100L model falls towards the entry level of the 6100 series of cameras. However, the 6100L is not an entry level camera by any standard. It is a robust and flexible camera with outstanding hardware and excellent lenses.

In my youth I was a dedicated hobby photographer. I shot in both 2  square format with twin-lens reflex cameras and 35mm with SLR cameras. I bulk loaded film, and developed and printed both formats in my home darkroom. I also worked in several camera stores in a major, metropolitan city, and I advised customers and sold every type of photography product including the most sophisticated and expensive cameras and darkroom equipment of the time, including professional equipment. I genuinely loved photography and captured thousands of images on film, many of which I printed. Although the years passed, and the darkroom equipment was sold off long ago, an appreciation of good photography gear and of good photography remains.

Digital photography and automation allow the masses to shoot excellent images. In the hands of creative people, these cameras afford great capabilities to capture shots that would likely have been missed with manually operated film cameras, even with motor drives or the first generation of automation (i.e. the Konica Autoreflex-T).

The choices for todays photographers, amateur or professional are almost limitless. Mirrorless, interchangeable lens digital cameras are an excellent choice for many users, and the Sony Alpha cameras have proven themselves to be excellent, well-respected cameras. The Sony 6100L is just such a camera.

The list of features, functions and specifications is extensive and far beyond inclusion in a brief review. The list of what the camera does not have is far shorter, and what is not present may, or may not matter at all to you, depending on your purpose and intentions for selecting the Alpha 6100L model.

Notable strengths include the Sony lenses. The normal lens included with the 6100L is a 16-55mm, f3.5 power zoom lens which is further enhanced by the cameras digital zoom. The two lens 6100Y model also includes a 55-210mm, f4.5 zoom portrait  telephoto lens. The 6100L is compatible with all Sony E-Series lenses.

The 6100 sensor is a 24.2 megapixel, APS-C, Exmor CMOS sensor measuring 23.5 x 15.6 mm (not full frame). The 6100L has powerful and outstanding Auto-Focus and Auto-Exposure functionality and offers the photographer complete exposure control with more than a dozen exposure modes, five focus modes and eight flash control modes. The Auto-Focus system is fantastic, and possibly the best available. With a spec of 425 auto-focus points and real-time eye AF (human and animal) and real-time tracking, it truly excels, and exceeds anything that I have experienced with other cameras. The 6100L has Sonys latest and most advanced image processor, the Bionz X, which undoubtedly is the underpinning of the excellent image rendition, with accurate color rendition, skin tones, etc.. The 6100L image formats range through 14 bit (compressed) RAW. The 6100L shoots video at resolution of up to 4k, and offers a wide range of frame rates (allowing for a variety of slow or fast motion shooting), image sizes and compression schemes.

The 6100L has an electronic viewfinder as well as a 2.95 TFT, touchscreen LCD screen, which is mounted on a pivot allowing for upward and downward tilt of the high-quality screen. This is particularly valuable when you want to capture low-angle shots without kneeling, and high-angle shots, such as holding the camera over the heads of the crowd standing in front of you, while still having a view of the screen, and access to the camera controls. The screen actually swings a full 180 degrees, allowing you to take selfies with the 6100. A proximity sensor at the viewfinder disables the touchscreen when the viewfinder is in use. The included rubber eye cup is comfortable and still provides for good eye relief for full viewfinder visibility, even when wearing eyeglasses.

The User Interface is complex, owing to the many, many settings and their many variables. Given that many smartphone cameras have UIs that require a familiarization period, the UI of the 6100L is on steroids. The user has an enormous range of options affording superior creative control of the photography, when desired, or allowing the 6100L to soar in full-automation excellence. The complexity of the interface and extensive menus are not the most intuitive, and there is a learning and adaptation curve. Given the numerous icons and graphic display elements, the viewfinder or display screen perimeter can be congested, and due to their small size, may be difficult to easily read.

I readily admit to frequently consulting the 6100L documentation (online  not printed), and there is a great deal of documentation and many useful resources available online from Sonys multiple 6100 series websites. (The primary document, the online User Guide is a whopping 580 pages, and may be downloaded as a printable PDF file, if you can afford the paper and toner/ink).

The 6100 is compact in size and light in weight, making it easy and convenient to carry or pack. The trade-off with a compact camera body, is that with the many control buttons and knobs, the buttons are small and some controls are in close proximity, resulting in occasional unintentional button depressions while manipulating the camera body.

The 6100L is supplied with one battery pack, which utilizes in-camera charging. An external battery charger, and additional battery packs are sold as accessories, and if you intend to shoot a great many stills, or lots of videos, or if recharge opportunities will be limited by location or time constraints, an additional battery pack, and perhaps the external charger, make good sense. The in-camera recharge time is at least a couple of hours. I intend to purchase at least one additional battery pack and the external charger, very soon.

A memory card is required to store images on-board the camera. SDXC UHS-I, V30, U3, C10 appears to be the SD card spec of preference. It appears that UHS-II cards, which may be used in the 6100L, are not of benefit due to hardware limitations. With the 6100L one-lens package there is no body cap or rear lens cap provided, although a rear lens cap is included with the 6100Y, two-lens package. If the camera is stored or carried with the lens off, a body cap should be installed and the rear of the lens should also be capped, as well as the front. The 6100L does not have a self-cleaning sensor or image stabilization (although some available lenses offer image stabilization). The 6100L is equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n but not ac, and the Wi-Fi is 2.4Ghz only, not dual band inclusive of 5.0Ghz. Bluetooth and NFC connectivity are also on-board. There is a built-in microphone and speaker and a mini-jack mike input, but no headphone output jack (why?).

The Sony Play Memories Camera App (smartphone and desktop) has had many critics among users. Early in 2019 Sony released the replacement / upgrade to Play Memories with Imaging Edge. The apps facilitate image transfers, including automatic transfers, and offer some advance functions including remote camera controls as well as editing RAW and even creation of time-lapse video.

I am genuinely enjoying using the 6100L. The feature set and exposure controls are so extensive and robust, that any creative photography utilization is very well supported. In the alternative, the 6100L can be placed in virtual control of the photography and trusted to produce excellent images of professional quality, with more simplified, point-and-shoot ease of use. Of course, how many point-and-shoot cameras will fire at 11 fps, bracket exposures and shoot with a 1/4000 sec. shutter speed that freezes action? Shooting at 11 fps (aided by a decent image buffer) is simply amazing, and rewards you with the potential to capture the perfect shot; just the frame(s) that you hoped for. Low light shooting is fantastic. The specs show an ISO standard/normal range of 32,000 and an expanded ISO range of an incredible 51,200. The 6100 also has a good built-in flash and hot-shoe. Again, exposure control is just incredible.

The camera hardware seems to be high-quality. The lens mount is metal, and lens locking is solid. The body is not the same magnesium alloy, dust and weather sealed body that is provided on the more expensive -series models. The 6100 body is plastic; probably polycarbonate. It really would be nice if the 6100 shared the same premium body as the rest of the -Series cameras. Nevertheless, there is nothing cheap or inferior about the hardware. It is sleek and elegant, and feels good when handled.

The Sony 6100L is really an excellent camera. It is extremely capable and is producing excellent photographs. I am enjoying the 6100L immensely, and could hardly be more pleased with the camera. The size, weight and outstanding features and technical capabilities of the 6100 really make it an excellent camera for many, many applications, and render it the perfect travel camera, as well. Of course I recommend this impressive camera very highly!"^5^Jan 7, 2020 9:09 AM

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*****Review*****
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would consider the Sony A6100 an entry to intermediate level mirrorless camera. When compared to its rivals, I would consider this the better value and superior in terms of image and video quality. The lightweight and compact design makes this camera perfect for traveling or on-the-go. With the A6100, youre able to take stunning photos without being a photographer; 4K video without being a videographer which make this camera immensely versatile.
 
While on paper most features do not seem much of an upgrade from the A6000, in-use I would consider this a long-awaited upgrade. The auto-focus feature is really where the A6100 outshines its predecessor. Also, this camera has external mic-input and a 180 degree flip screen which makes taking selfies easier and (youtube) vlogging possible. While I noticed little difference between the two when taking photos of static subjects, I found the A6100 to edge out on moving/action shots and definitely video. I also think the low-light images and video really delivers. The camera can also be used while charging (battery in unit) so there is virtually no down-time if you need to constantly capture photos or videos. 
 
To get down to the cons, depending on whom you ask, this will vary. I personally think the 16-50mm lens it comes with isgood enoughif you intend to use for quick and easy photos to capture those once in a lifetime memories. For intermediate level, I would highly recommend purchasing another lens kit or body only and invest in lenses. Theres also no in camera stabilization so you may want to opt for lenses with stabilization.
 
I also find that moving the viewfinder a bit cumbersome. I find myself having to grip extra hard so I dont accidentally drop the camera due to the rigidness. With the eyepiece cap on, the corner of the screen is obstructed which is not a deal breaker, a mild annoyance really.

Overall, I think the A6100 is a well-rounded mirrorless camera for those who want a lightweight, compact, more than your standard point-and-shoot and doesnt want the bulk, HEFTY price tag and maintenance of a DSLR.

With a wide range of price points and features, it can be daunting to choose one that will suit your particular needs. Thus, enter the Sony 6100 that hopes to provide great performance with a relative moderate cost. Regardless, if you are a professional photographer or just beginning a new hobby, the 6100 hopes to find its place in an already competitive series from Sony. While the 6100 is a cut down of higher models such as the 6500 or 6600, it is still powered by the same APS-C Type Exmor CMOS sensor that will certainly make it an attractive option for those shopping for a new camera. Naturally, I was excited to try Sonys latest offering.
 
 Once received, the Sony 6100 comes in a rather compact looking box. Inside, you will note several standard accessories such as the shoulder strap, the battery, eye piece, an AC adapter, and a USB cable. Unfortunately, there is only a quick start guide, forcing you to download the full manual. In addition, the 6100 comes in three different kits; my particular kit, the 6100L, comes with the 16-50mm lens pre-attached. As for the body, the 6100 is quite captivating. It has a nice black polish and is smooth to the touch. It is definitely of high quality. Overall, the 6100 feels quite solid and compact. Additionally, it does have a bit of weight to it but nothing that would cause issue. Furthermore, the rubber grip on the right has a nice rugged feel. Looking down from the top, the camera you will notice a slit for the multi-interface slot for optional accessories. Next to that you will see the flash compartment, which will automatically pop up when you press the flash button. Next, you will note the On/Off switch as well as the shutter button on top. To the right, you will see the custom button (C1). The mode selection wheel is next to that, where you can select various modes depending on your needs such as automatic, aperture priority, movie, or scene selection. When you select scene selection, you can further choose from an additional ten different modes such as sports, night scene, or landscape. When the dial is set to automatic, you can choose from either intelligent or superior. On the back, you will notice several standard buttons such as menu and the main control wheel. You will also note the delete button, which also acts as the second custom button. On the top left of the display, you will note the viewfinder that automatically sleeps the main screen when you look through it. Additionally, to the right of the viewfinder is the adjustment wheel for its display. To the right of the display, you will see the AEL button that will also zoom in on your pictures after you have pressed the playback button (you will use the wheel to zoom out and the buttons to position your view). Moving to the bottom, you will see the battery and SD card compartments. On the left side of the body, you will note the USB and HDMI compartment as well as a 3.5mm microphone jack. To open the compartment, slide the compartment lid towards you. Do NOT pry it open! Overall, the layout is fairly straightforward, though may take some time to get use to it. Lastly, you will notice that the 6100 is missing auto/manual focus switch that is found on the 6500/6600.

Next, I would like to go through the main menu and briefly go through its organization. Once you press menu, you will notice six icons across the top: Quality/Image, Move, Network, Playback, Setup, and My Menu Setting. Additionally, each one of these has multiple pages that you can access by highlighting a setting below and pressing right on the control button. There are a total of 30 pages across these six categories. On the quality/image page, you will note several main settings including your picture format (JPEG, RAW, or RAW+JPEG), aspect ratio (3:2, 16:9 or 1:1), JPEG quality (Extra Fine, Fine, Standard), and image size. As expected, your image size presets will change when you change the aspect ratio. For example, when you set your aspect ratio to 16:9, your image size presets are 5.1, 10, and 20 megapixels. In addition, if you set your image to a 3:2 aspect ratio, your presets will now change to 6, 12 and 24 megapixels respectively.

 As for image quality, I wanted to run through a test that would be the equivalent of an out of box experience with the least amount of settings changed as it would be nearly impossible to test every single setting. For my test, I used a Sony 32 GB UHS-II SD card (model SF-G32T). I first set the file format to JPEG with an aspect ratio of 16:9, with the quality set to large (20 megapixels) and JPEG quality set to standard compression. Lastly, I set the mode selection dial to auto and set the camera to intelligent auto. For the most part, the images produced are quite exceptional and should speak for themselves. Given maximum compression, I was extremely pleased with the results. In the picture with our Christmas tree, you can see quite a bit of detail on the decoration. In addition, you can see the glitter as it glistens quite nicely next to the lamp. In the next image, you can see our new holiday hat! For this picture, I reduced the lighting in the room, but as you can see it still came out fairly vibrant. Lastly, in our third picture, I like that you can distinguish the different lighting of the ornaments in our holiday decorations! Overall, I think most people will be extremely pleased with the image quality, though do keep in mind that your results will surely differ. Nonetheless, the images were stellar.
 
Additionally, I did a quick movie test by filming a quick one minute video. For my test, I left everything at default but changed the codec to 4K XAVC S and set the quality to 24p/100M. In addition, the audio was automatically recorded in uncompressed PCM at 48 KHz/16 Bit. Furthermore, I used the same Sony SD card from before as it has the V90 certification for video recording. During the test, I captured different speeds of motion while moving the camera throughout our house. Connectively, I occasionally picked an object to zoom in on for a few seconds then zoomed out. I was extremely impressed with the stabilization the 6100 showed. Additionally, I did not see any lag or skipped frames while recording. Also, during recording you will see two bars on your display for each audio channel. I was quite impressed that the integrated microphone was quite responsive, as it was able to pick up audio from the next room. I am also relieved that the audio was recorded uncompressed, so every intricate sound is captured! I think for the most part everyone will be quite pleased. The recording was extremely smooth as well as video playback. Lastly, I want to mention that the memory card you use will make a big difference. It is absolutely imperative that you use the fastest card you can afford, preferably one with a V60 or V90 rating to provide you with that extra speed just in case. In addition, I want to caution that your results will likely differ than what I have listed here depending on your SD card and settings, but hopefully this can give you some idea on what to expect.
 
 In conclusion, the Sony 6100 is a fabulous camera that certainly deserves the attention from those who are looking to purchase a new digital camera. While the 6100 may receive criticism for being a cut down model of higher ones within the 6 series, I believe it can still be an attractive alternative especially if you are planning to purchase one of the bundles that includes additional lenses. Connectively, the 6100 uses the same exact sensor as the other models. In addition, I was extremely impressed with the 16-50mm and how smooth I was able to zoom in and out with ease. As for image quality, I was extremely impressed with the color as well as a plethora of settings that will allow you to take breathtaking photos. As for video, I was impressed with how flawless the recording was. Regardless of your experience in photography, or if you are seeking a new hobby, the 6100 has enough features that should please both enthusiasts and the average user. With that said, the 6100L bundle is a fairly competitive package that comes highly recommended."^5^Jan 7, 2020 5:22 AM
Duluthian^/sony-alpha-6100-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-e-pz-16-50mm-lens-black/6375665?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"I'm writing this review from the viewpoint of 35 years of photography experience. I would consider myself to be an advanced amateur although I have shot many weddings, graduation sessions and family gatherings for hire over the years. To put it simply, bang for your buck you can not go wrong with this camera. Let me dive into it a bit more.

First, the build quality is very nice for the price point. It is true that it is made of plastic with a nice rubberized grip. I don't see this as a problem considering the intended target audience for this camera. Sony sells a couple of higher tier models that look virtually the same and even have the same sensor, yet cost considerably more. What do you gain with them? Well, you gain a magnesium body and depending on the model, built in image stabilization. Sure there are a few other upgraded specs on the higher end models, but nothing major and the sensor (I.E., picture quality) is exactly the same as the A6100. Neither of those 'upgrades' are worth up to close to twice the price depending on what one you were to choose. The A6100 is built plenty good enough for 99% of the users out there.

The camera feels very good in your hands. I find the controls logically placed and easy to understand. The rear touchscreen flips out and has a nice resolution. The eye piece view finder (EVF) is also very nice, although at a slightly lower resolution compared to many other cameras on the market. However, it works just fine and shouldn't be an issue. 

In terms of features, most cameras in this price range are going to be about the same. I won't dive deep into the specs as you can pull up the list of specs in the camera description. I will say that as someone who has probably used every major camera brand on the market, you will not be left wanting for anything. I can not think of a situation this camera will not be able to handle. One thing it does lack is in-body stabilization. Now to be fair, many of the other makers don't offer this, either. At least not at this price point. But if you are coming from a pocket camera or used to just using your phone as your camera, you may be a little shocked to find that it is not there. But have no fear, because most of the Sony lenses (particularly the zooms such as the 16-50mm that is included) have image stabilization built into the lens. So the fact that the camera body itself doesn't have it, really is not an issue. 

The battery used is the same one (NP-FW50) that has now been used in many Sony cameras over the recent years. Battery life is good for a mirrorless camera. Mirrorless cameras (regardless of brand) have a tendency to not have the best battery life. 300-400 photos would be considered good for any mirrorless. The reason for this is one, the cameras are smaller so the batteries need to be as well. And two, with both a rear LCD and an EVF, they draw a lot of power. Still, even for a mirrorless I found the battery to be a little better than what I am used to. Although I would certainly buy at least one spare if you do anything more than the occasional snap shots (I know I did :-) ). 

Now, the most important factor is image quality. Simply put, it is fantastic! The photos are clear, noise free (at reasonable lower ISO settings) and have accurate color. I have been happy with the photos so far all the way up to ISO 6400. Although the ISO on all modern cameras can technically go higher, beyond ISO 6400 is really just an emergency situation kind of thing on any of them. Beyond looking at the image on the back of the camera, the images beyond ISO 6400 usually will look pretty bad. Again, that is all cameras. But with that having been said, in 35 years I have never once needed to shoot with an ISO over that and even getting close to ISO 6400 is rare. So in reality, it will never be an issue. 

The included lens in this kit is an image stabilized 16-50mm. As a general rule, the lenses that come packaged in a kit are usually okay but not great. This one is really no different. The zoom range is nice (particularly going as wide as 16mm) and the image quality is certainly not bad. But if you decide you want to get a bit more serious about photography you will want to upgrade the lens eventually. But to be honest, that is why kit lenses are generally just 'okay'. They are included to get you started and let you decide what focal lengths will work for your needs. Once you are comfortable with the camera, then you have tons of lenses to choose from for an upgrade. 

As I mentioned at the beginning, I do weddings on occasion. When doing these it is important to have a camera that not only provides great image quality, but also it needs to be reliable. Now this would not be a camera I would use as my primary camera for a wedding. I have full-frame cameras for that. But would I be comfortable using it as a backup or secondary camera at a wedding? You bet! The handling, features and most importantly the image quality would easily be fine for a wedding. So would I recommend this camera? In a heartbeat!"^5^Jan 7, 2020 5:01 PM
ITJim^/sony-alpha-6100-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-e-pz-16-50mm-lens-black/6375665?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"Conclusion: 

This is by no means a complete review of this camera and all its features. This is a feature rich camera that no single review will be able to fully appreciate.

I love this camera! It is versatile, compact, and takes excellent photos in all lighting conditions. There are hundreds of features and options built into this camera that will keep an amateur photographer like me engaged for the foreseeable future. There is a plethora of accessories that I can add to this camera to meet any needs that the stock camera does not currently fulfill. The Alpha 6100 is a flexible, feature rich platform that I am going to enjoy exploring for years. 

What originally convinced me to own this camera? A friend of mine is a professional photographer. He photographs and videos professional trade shows and conferences. I noticed one day that he changed out his typical SLR and video camera for the Sony Alpha 6000. I asked him why. He told me that for half the money he could get almost the same quality as his more expensive cameras. Plus, he only needed one camera to do both video and stills. I did not need a new camera at the time. Today, my digital SLR is non-operational. I decided to jump on the Alpha 6100. Im glad I did. I got a heck of an upgrade for the same money my old camera cost.

What do I like:

The camera is small, compact, and what I would call a dense .78lbs with the stock lens attached. The bump out on the right of the camera body is small compared to a traditional digital SLR camera. For me, this makes the camera awkward to hold. This may change with the addition of a larger lens. Stock, the camera is compact enough that my hands crowd close together. The Power Zoom on the included lens adds to my awkward handling. I have medium sized hands. Think medium sized adult winter gloves. I can see someone with large hands having a very difficult time handling this camera with the included E PZ 16-50 lens. This all being said, I find the compromise between weight and size acceptable for my needs. I can move easily between stills and videos with the touch of a single button. If I want to get fancy, then I can get GP-VPT1 shooting grip. This will allow me to point and shoot without worrying about any awkward handling positions. Sonys site has a plethora of lenses, adapters, flashes, remote control, power options, and accessories listed for this camera. Many of these items are available on Best Buy. Sonys site will tell you exactly what is compatible with this camera and the items part number. Better yet, I can put the camera on a tripod and remote view and shoot using Sonys mobile app or desktop app.

One feature I liked is the Auto White Balance. Yeah, I know, auto white balance tends to be terrible for all cameras. The Alpha 6100, in my opinion, does a better job, at this price point, than most. Indoor 
shots are still yellowish. Outdoor shots, however, are a different story. I took the camera on a hike along a snow-covered trail. I Left everything at full auto. The camera auto adjusted its settings for macro shots, portraits, and for different lighting conditions. The white balance was pretty good. Now, this could have been the position of the sun, the time of day, or having snow as the backdrop. Regardless, I am pleased with the results. I also took a few videos of a waterfall. The videos were clean, well balanced, and detailed. The sound was good for not having an external mic. Moving from still to video was super easy. There is a record button near where your right thumb will naturally rest while holding the camera. Press once to start recording. Press a second time to stop. It does not get any easier than that.

Auto mode has two modes: Intelligent Auto and Superior Auto. From Sony, Intelligent Auto automatically identifies a scenes characteristics and shoots a photo. Superior Auto beautifully shoots automatically while reducing blurring and noise. As a test, I took two photos of my shed using each setting under natural lighting conditions. White balance threw a little grey into the shot but not much. You will want to consult with the online users guide for more details. I included the two shots with my review.

Another auto mode, SCN, gives you more control. This is an auto mode for all the cameras major shooting modes such as Portrait, Sports Action, Macro, Landscape, and more. There are two ways to set the SCNs shoot mode. First, you can take the long way around through the cameras menu system. I found this method slow and clunky. The second way is via the Function button located above the D-pad. Press the button and then use the D-pad and built in scroll wheel to quickly chose your shoot mode.

The options here, as mentioned before, are enormous and much more than a simple Best Buy review can get into. I will say that the flexibility here is rich and appreciated for those of us who did not go to photography school. For those who did go to photography school then you will be happy to know that you can adjust any of the other modes on the camera to your hearts content. For example, Program Auto, P on the dial, has eleven pages of options under the image setting and another 9 pages under the movie settings. Press the Function key and all the options directly related to your shot are available via a simple to navigate graphical interface. These include Drive Mode, Focus Mode, Focus Area, Exposure Comp., ISO, Metering Mode, Flash Mode, Flash Comp., White Balance, Creative Style, and Silent shooting. 

The Alpha 6100 can also take panoramic photos, slow motion videos, and quick motion videos. I have no need, yet, to shoot slow motion or quick motion videos. Panorama, however, is pretty darn impressive. I took a panorama of my workspace, the camera must have taken 50 photos, and then stitched them together like it only took a single photo. The image was in focus and detailed. I did not like the default length of the panoramic shot. I wanted to stop early but the camera continued shooting until I had completed the pre-defined panoramic field. One issue I did run into with Panoramic is with anything moving in shot. For example, I took a Panoramic of a track and field facility. The people walking across the grounds during the shot had a double exposure affect. This may entirely be due to my lack of experience with panoramic photos, the cameras software, or some setting I failed to turn on. Just be aware to take some sample shots of what you want to capture before you pull the trigger on the real shot.

The LCD screen is not a touch screen. This may seem strange in a world where cell phones have become the dominate photography tool. Sony delivers an excellent button layout to help navigate the screen. The buttons are all properly marked. The D-pad doubles as a scroll wheel. And the Scroll wheel has a selection button in the middle. There are also functions located to each compass point on the scroll wheel for easy access and navigation. 

The scroll wheel is used to zoom through features, menu items, and options. You can quickly scroll through your images by rolling your thumb left or right along the scroll wheels track. You can also quickly zoom in, zoom out, and navigate an image that you want to take a closer look at after shooting. I thought it was a bit awkward when I first used it. After using it for a bit, I cannot image owning another camera without it. Home run for Sony!

Finally, the screen itself has multiple functions available. Pressing up on the D-pad switches between four screen layouts with differing levels of details including a preview of your image, shot features, information about your photo, and histograms. Pretty much whatever you want to know about your shot before pressing the shutter button is accessible. 

The screen is attached to a mechanical arm that allows you to move the screen away from the camera body. This allows you multiple viewing angles while you shoot. The screen can also be flipped 180 degrees allowing for selfies. The Alpha 6100 automatically flips the LCD image when in selfie mode. Sony also added interactive features between the viewfinder and the view screen. There is a sensor in the eye piece that detects your eye, or something close to it, that, when triggered, automatically turns off the view screen and activates the view finder screen. All the same information is present. My old camera used to keep both on regardless of which one I was using. I always found this distracting. Thank you, Sony!

Sony made connecting your camera with your cell phone super easy. The camera will display a QR Code that your phone uses to establish a connection. Another QR Code is used to acquire the mobile app, Imaging Edge. You can control the camera from your phone, view photos, setup location information, check current news related to the app, review help files, and remote control the camera. Unfortunately, the app needs a major usability pass. For example, if I remotely capture photos then I cannot view any photos until I first shut down the app and restart the app. Some screens do not have a back button. 
Another thing I cannot do from the app is set the cameras photo function. I must spin the function wheel manually to get what I want. Then the options for that mode will be made available to me from the app. I would have preferred the ability to control all camera features and functions remotely. One word of caution. Turn the remote features off when you travel. Bluetooth is easily compromised. The good news is that there is an Airplane Mode under the Network settings in your cameras menu. Turn this on when not using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to protect yourself and your photos. 

What I did not like:

The built-in flash is harsh. Period. I would avoid using it unless absolutely needed."^5^Jan 6, 2020 3:16 PM
Gizmo^/sony-alpha-6100-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-e-pz-16-50mm-lens-black/6375665?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"This camera could not have come at a better time! Ive been a long time Canon SLR user, starting with a Rebel XT, the most recent one I had was the 6D, a full frame camera. After seeing how small (relative to Canon SLRs) the Sony mirrorless cameras are and the beautiful photos my co-worker was getting from his Sony (6500), I decided to make the switch. It wasnt easy as I had several nice lenses, flash and camera to get rid of. There were several factors that convinced me to move from Canon to Sony. They are as follows:

- Video autofocus: The Canon 6D I had lacked autofocus in video mode, for me, video mode without autofocus makes the video feature pretty much useless, if my subject moved closer or further, Id have to refocus manually. What I love about the Sony is the video 4k quality (with autofocus) and the 1 button to start and stop recording! I didnt have to switch to video mode, then press record. 

- Intuitive menus: Menus on the Canons are not as intuitive as I wouldve liked. I found the menus to connecting to an iPhone or an iPad to be very confusing and frustrating. Perhaps I just didnt understand the logic of their menus although Im fairly tech savvy, so Im not sure. The menu on Sony 6100 is logical and laid out in an intuitive manner. There are some settings for the camera where there are several pages of menus, but the dots on the bottom of the menu and the 1/3 in the upper right hand corner lets you know where you are, nice subtle touches. I was even able to setup Favorites easily. 

- What you see IS what you get with the Sony  With my old camera, the exposure might look fine through the viewfinder, the line is where it should be to get a good exposure, but the picture often comes out darker or lighter than expected. With the Sony, the image you see on the screen or electronic viewfinder is the image you get. Much less chances of missing the shot you were hoping to get. 

- Size: as mentioned above, the size of the Sony is very compact! With the 16-50 lens, I was still able to fit it in my ski jacket pocket. I cant get over the features and technology Sony was able to fit in such a small, compact package and it weighs about half as much as my previous camera! 

Usability:
The Sony feels very nice and solid but I wouldnt go as far as to say it very comfortable to hold. Its compact, there isnt a lot of surfaces that is molded to fit your hand. The screen can tilt and flip, perfect for vloggers! Youll notice when the screen is flipped over, the bottom right corner is partially blocked by the eye piece. Not a big deal to me as Ill probably never use that feature, maybe annoying to some. Speaking of screen, while it is technically a touch screen, its can only be used to tap on focal points and zooming during playback mode. You cant use the screen to change settings, it would be a bit small (3) to change settings on it anyway, buttons are probably easier. All the buttons are nicely laid out and easy to understand. To find different scenes (macro, sports, night etc), you have to go to SCN first, then select the scene from the sub menu on the screen. 
Features and performance:
The Sony has all the features one would come to expect from a SLR. The features I was pleasantly surprised by are HDR and Panorama. With the HDR, the camera will take multiple exposures of the same image and combine the images. With panorama mode, the photo takes multiple images as you slowly rotate the camera, when its done taking the photos, itll stich them together creating 1 wide image. Yes, these features are available on phones these days, but its a nice feature to have on your camera. 
Transferring images from the camera to your phone is very easy with the Imaging Edge Mobile app. On the camera, press menu, scroll over to Network  Send to Smartphone Func, select the cameras WiFi and use the app or the camera to select the photos you want to transfer, thats it! 
The included kit lens, f3.5-5.6/16-50mm, is decent for beginners. If youre somewhat serious about photography, youll want to upgrade to a nice prime or zoom lens that offers lower constant aperture. 
Battery life could be better, youd definitely want to pick up an extra one to have in your bag (NP-FW50, retails for $60) and maybe even an external charger.

Conclusion:
Overall, I really like this camera alot, its the perfect balance between price, functionality, features, image/video quality and size. For a vacation, Id take this over a point and shoot any day to have the flexibility of interchangeable lenses. Id say this camera is good for someone looking to get into a SLR camera through intermediate photographer or someone more advanced but doesnt want to lug around heavy a camera bag!"^5^Jan 15, 2020 9:47 PM
mojo^/sony-alpha-6100-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-e-pz-16-50mm-lens-black/6375665?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Having owned the a6000, I was interested in what the a6100 had to offer as improvements. In a nutshell, although the a6000 is 6 years old [an eternity in the camera world] does the a6100 offer enough improvements to justify the price differential?

Maybe the most important factor to consider with any camera, picture quality is good but Sony can still be a bit aggressive in their noise reduction and resulting results due to this. Compared to the a6000, I see noticeably better looking photos, colors are richer. Also, the a6100 outputs RAW format photos if PP is your thing.

The autofocus and ability to identify a focus point via the touch screen works well. Tracking of moving subjects, in my limited experience, is great. Speaking of the screen, the ability to flip screen is a bonus, esp the ability to face the front of the camera. 

Perhaps a minor point but the a6100 has a silent-shutter option, the a6000 does not. Another possibly minor point but one I find quite useful, the built-in flash is constructed such that you can pull the flash bracket back a bit and bounce it off the ceiling, typically creating a more pleasing shot.

On the downside, menu diving is still a chore, even for simple tasks. As an example, I rely heavily on preset shooting modes and find that preset modes being available through a camera's mode dial the fastest means to switch for different shooting goals and conditions. Here, you can assign a function button to take you to the memory recall settings menu item and then choose the desired setting, basically a show-stopper in fast action conditions. This is a personal sore spot although the a6100 is not alone in this regard.

For my type of shooting, I'd look elsewhere but for the set-it-and-forget-it crowd or the point and shoot folks, the a6100 comes through, though you will pay a bit of a premium for the Sony brand name. As the a6000 is still available [6 years is a LONG time in camera tech, though] at a lower price, Sony would do well to cut the price on the a6100 a bit if they are serious about attracting these groups. For one on a tight budget, the a6000 represents a better value."^4^Jan 9, 2020 9:13 AM
MizuNoHane^/sony-alpha-6100-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-e-pz-16-50mm-lens-black/6375665?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"I have always been interested in purchasing a mirrorless camera, Sony Alpha especially, but as smartphones get better and more expensive, a dedicated camera is harder to justify. That said, the tiny sensor size in phone cameras limit them in some key ways. I now feel it's worth getting a mirrorless camera (APS-C or full-frame) if you need the following from your photos:
1. Resolution and quality that can be printed A4 size or larger
2. Depth of field (the 'portrait' or background blur effect that is still poorly replicated on phones)
3. Significant telephoto for long-range photography/videography.
4. Good low-light performance.

This camera does all of those things. Its upgrades over the a6000 are substantial. Battery life is better, both in terms of shots you can take and standby time. The expanded and more accurate autofocus also now includes eye autofocus. This makes portrait shooting a breeze, and now works with pets. The stabilized lens, eye-AF and wider sensor allowed me to get sharp shots of my dog in low light - things I never could have hoped for with my phone. The other thing that works wonderfully is the flip-up screen, great for selfies and vlogging. It's not as versatile as a screen that flips to the side, which would allow you to shoot from weird and interesting new angles, but I appreciated any additional flexibility compared to the a6000. For me, these additional features, including high-res 4K video recording, strike a nice compromise between the a6000 and the a6400, a more expensive version of this camera, which has a few more features for an even higher price, such as video color-grading. Really, the only major thing one would upgrade further for is the in-body image stabilization in the a6500 and a6600, which are significantly more expensive than the a6100 or a6400. In most situations, purchasing an Optical SteadyShot (OSS) lens, or a lens with stabilization built in, will get you similar results without having to step up to the a6500.

So about that included lens. This one comes with a kit lens, and I wholeheartedly recommend this camera with the major caveat that a buyer should expect to purchase at least 1-2 additional lenses to justify owning this as opposed to just sticking with their phone. That's not an insignificant price increase, especially with autofocus lenses (each about $200-400). The kit lens is flexible, but its slow aperture - f3.5 at the wide end and f5.6 at the telephoto end - makes RAW photos suffer in some key ways, which I can illustrate with the uploaded photos below. In low-light, the kit lens is noisy. Further, it's not particularly sharp, and because of the slow aperture, the bokeh effect you get with your portraits is minimal. Do not get me wrong. In all these respects - noise, sharpness, bokeh, printability - it is still markedly better than your smartphone. But if you are hoping to really maximize the potential in this camera - and trust me, there is a LOT of potential - I would budget at least a few hundred dollars more to purchase at least one more lens to get either that portrait or telephoto effect. I also included some shots taken with a Sony 50mm f1.8 OSS lens, and the differences are readily apparent. If you're wanting to just shoot low-light portrait shots of posed friends/family, etc, you can save the money, get a Sony a6000 used or renewed, and purchase a third-party manual focus lens with a fast aperture, which can be had for as low as $120. But if you step up to the a6100, it's because you want to shoot video in 4K, or shoot high-quality portrait photos of fast-moving objects you want to track with continuous autofocus like athletes, kids, babies or pets, or because you want to vlog. If the last use case is the only reason you are buying this, the kit lens may do just fine as at 16mm you have noticeable bokeh in good lighting. But if you want to use this for anything else, I would strongly recommend budgeting the cost of additional lenses into your purchase. If you are more familiar with the types of lenses you would want, you could also consider buying the a6100 body only and then individually purchasing your lenses.

That was a lot, but the short answer is that mirrorless cameras, and dedicated cameras in general, are still much better than phones and will likely continue to be for several years. I think the a6100 is a worthy upgrade to the a6000, an already very good camera, in very important ways. If you know what you're hoping to get out of this camera, you'll be thrilled with it. It's a winner."^5^Jan 7, 2020 2:59 PM

- With a large image sensor and 24M image capacity, this camera that only weighs a pound and can fit in the pocket of your cargo pants, can shoot beautiful, crisp, and highly detailed pictures.
- The automatic focusing tech that Sony brings to this device is truly astonishing. Subjects eyes and facial features are always in focus, even when they are moving. Sony is ahead of the competition in this area.
- The lens that is supplied in this kit is not the best glass you can get. Thankfully, there is a wide variety of high-quality lenses that one can use with this camera, that will complete the transformation to performance like DSLRs costing thousands of dollars more. 
- Color accuracy is excellent; I very rarely need to adjust my images in Photoshop.
- There are options for many automatic adjustments, such as multiple image acquisition for backlit or low light scenes. Alternatively, the photographer may assume full manual control.
Now for some nit-picks:
- With robust features and flexibility comes complexity; there is a bit of a learning curve to become facile with all the menu and shooting options. I have been using this camera on my vacation in Mexico for the past week, and I am just now becoming very confident with it under different situations. 
- I did watch some videos on-line to help with the initial set-up, and these were mostly helpful.
- The battery is rated to take over 300 images on a charge. I am shooting high definition images, occasional RAW images, and using the Panorama and HDR functions. With this I may get 200 images/charge. Happily, replacement batteries can be obtained from third parties that cost about $10 apiece, and I always have a spare ready.
- The transfer of images by wi-fi works only so well. It is still much faster to put the SD in a card reader or attach the camera to the computer by USB. 
- On 2 or 3 occasions I have had the camera freeze, necessitating turning it off and then restarting. I may have done something wrong, or this may be the consequence of having complicated, sophisticated imaging software being deployed. 
All in all, I am very pleased with this camera. It has all the flexibility for creative photography that I need as an active hobbyist, at a fraction of the price and weight of traditional DSLRs. I am particularly happy with the ability to capture active grandchildren in low light, and consistent beautiful bokeh effect in portraits. I recommend this product highly but bear in mind you will need some time to learn to use it.

Sony provided the camera in exchange for this review, and I was pleased to be able to use it to capture some shots over the last two weeks, during the Christmas holiday season. I'll mention my impressions of the features I found noteworthy.

If you're considering purchasing this camera, you may already understand quite a bit about digital camera technology and why you would want to invest in one in order to capture pictures that smartphones simply aren't capable of. If you haven't, the short answer is that these cameras have dramatically bigger sensors that capture more light and can produce the shallow-depth-of-field ('blurry background') effect without all the digital processing tricks that smartphones rely on. In the enthusiast stand-alone camera market, there are two primary types of cameras - DSLR's and 'mirrorless' cameras (the Alpha 6100 is a mirrorless camera). Without saying too much about the technical differences, the latter are so named because they eliminate the physical mirrors that DSLR's use - the viewfinder is actually a tiny LCD screen that shows you exactly the picture the camera is going to take, including helpful information overlays. Traditionally, the downside of mirrorless cameras has been slower autofocus systems and perceptible lag in the viewfinder. However, Sony and other companies have been relentlessly tackling these problems, and even the industry giants Canon and Nikon are producing mirrorless systems now to cater to people that like their advantages.

As mentioned, I have used multiple Sony cameras - mirrorless always appealed to me as the inevitable future for stand-alone cameras, and I have invested in a few additional lenses for Sony's mirrorless camera system. In the meantime, Sony has really improved their technology and made some waves amongst professional photographers. The Sony Alpha 6100 takes their current state-of-the-art auto-focus system with real-time tracking and adds it to a model in reach of hobbyists and families that want to capture gorgeous photo memories. The auto-focus system can be switched between person and pet tracking modes, and has an uncanny ability to lock onto subjects' eyes. Once locked onto a subject, continuing to hold the shutter button half-pressed will keep the focus locked on, and does a fantastic job of following that subject as they move and turn - often even if the subject is partially- or fully-obscured momentarily. This is definitely the best auto-focus system I've used on a Sony camera, and from other reviews of the Alpha 6100's siblings, Sony seems to have one of the top focusing systems right now. If you're thinking of this camera as an investment to capture pictures of children in motion, the auto-focus system is a very good reason to purchase the Alpha 6100. The only downside is that you will need to change some of the options out-of-the-box to enable the real-time tracking and tweak how it works to your preferences.

Another improvement over Sony's older models that I really like is the improvements to smartphone connectivity. Sony has had an optional companion app for mobile Android and iOS devices for a while, and they renamed it from 'PlayMemories' to 'Imaging Edge' since my previous camera model. The app is not the most intuitive, and I did find it a little cumbersome to get it connected initially. (I was using an iPhone; maybe it would be slightly easier with Android. However, NFC did work - I'm not sure if that improvement in Imaging Edge is due to an improvement by Sony or Apple, but it's cool that NFC can be used on iOS now to simplify the Wi-Fi connection.) I have found it to be reliable enough - no dropped connections between camera and phone yet. Sony's app has always allowed you to turn your phone into a remote control for the camera, which is a great feature if you want to set up the camera on a tripod and take a group photo that you can be part of. It's also long supported transferring photos from the camera to the phone, to make it easier to share them (or edit them with another app). However, one feature that is new with latest series of Alpha cameras is an additional Bluetooth connection support which the app leverages to 'geotag' photos using your phone's GPS. I always thought it was really neat to be able to see my vacation photos taken with a smartphone on a map based on where they were taken, and had wished that data could be integrated with my 'good' camera. Although I've used apps that log your phone's location and then use that to add the data to photos later based on timestamp, it's pretty cool that it can now be integrated right as the photos are taken. This is a feature that some of Sony's competitors have already had for a while, but it's a nice-to-have on the Alpha 6100. (Of course, if you use this feature and are conscious about privacy, be careful to consider removing geotag information before sharing photos online.)

The Alpha 6100 takes great pictures. It takes some practice to get the hang of adding effects that everyone is used to adding with filters in smartphone apps, but the results really are great. With a 24MP sensor, the images capture a lot of information and are great for printing. Due to the larger sensor, pictures taken in low light exhibit less digital noise than smartphones (though smartphones can compensate with more software corrections). I've very pleased with the color and sharpness I've gotten. I do not typically shoot a lot of video, but this camera can take 4K footage and I thought the video quality was quite good on a 4K TV. It does not support some of the more advanced videography features (like S-Log), though higher-end Sony models do.

The Alpha 6100 is typically sold in a bundle with a small, 16-50mm power-zoom lens. The lens is compact enough, especially compared to typical DSLR lenses. It's a OK starter lens and works well with the auto-focus system. Sony and other manufacturers make a number of E-mount lenses with a range of prices. Although many will cost as much or more than the camera (which is common for any interchangeable-lens camera system), there are some reasonably-priced gems and many of the expensive ones are highly rated. 

I really appreciated that Sony is still using the same battery that earlier cameras in their NEX and Alpha 6000 series used. This means all my spare batteries work with any camera and charger. On the downside, Sony's higher end models are now beginning to use a newer batter that has longer life, but I found battery life to be more than sufficient for my needs. (The batteries are small and it's easy to care a spare or two.) If you're not already a Sony camera user, this may not matter to you - but I would like to point out that all of Sony's cameras have featured USB charging built-in, which is actually quite convenient (they can charge with a simple micro-USB cable; no need to to travel with a charger unless you want to).

The Alpha 6100 uses a slightly lower resolution LCD screen in its electronic viewfinder than in higher-end Sony models, but I still find it very clear to use. One feature I miss that Sony has included on other models is an artificial horizon overlay in the viewfinder (or rear screen) that makes it easy to get level horizons in your shorts. The rear screen is touch-sensitive, though the interface still must be operated with the controls on the rear of the camera - the touch is mostly used for tapping to pick a focus point if you can't get the camera to focus where you want. The rear touch screens of Sony's latest models now do flip up 180 degrees - basically a 'selfie mode.' I think using this camera for selfies is a bit silly, but it could certainly be very practical if you're interested in making YouTube-style videos.

My existing investment in the Sony mirrorless system makes me admittedly biased, but Sony has been making some very good cameras. There are highly-regarded competitors, but the Alpha 6100 is still a great purchase. It's an extremely nice upgrade to older cameras at the lower end of Sony's Alpha 6000 lineup, adding the latest auto-focus and smartphone connectivity features while retaining lens and battery compatibility. And for anyone considering the investment in a stand-alone camera, the Alpha 6100 has a nice blend of features for a reasonable price."^5^Jan 7, 2020 10:28 PM

It is lightweight, compact and great to handle. It is plastic, metal would have been great, but it feels sturdy and nice in the hand. The viewfinder is very useful and although I still need to get more familiar with the software and button layout, everything is straight forward and easy to understand. 

Taking pictures has been great. The camera itself as well as auto focus is very, very fast. Pictures are extremely crisp, and while I like my results so far, once I get more into lighting, focus and other things, I think they will only get better. Video is much of the same, but here I really need to learn a few things. That said, to shoot in 4K is crazy to me, but the little samples I have shot look better than I thought they would. Again, here, the viewfinder shows its value with added versatility. I am ready to explore this more.

One of the things I am most excited about with this camera is to be able to improve it as I do. As is, the camera is great and has all the tools I need at the moment, but the ability to add lights, mics and other tools is very exciting. Most importantly though, are lenses. The included lens has performed well, but when I get to the point where I want to do more, I can add new glass to help get me there. 

My only real issue with the camera is the battery (sort of). While it does last fairly long when dealing with photos, it does take a hit when taking video. That is expected, and, honestly, it still does well, but I do not understand why Sony did not include a charger with the camera. To have to plug the camera in to charge it is not optimal. I will end up picking up batteries and a charger anywaybut it would have been nice to see something included.

In the end, I am very happy with this camera. I think it is a great value. You get a feature-rich camera (with some higher end features at a lower price point), a great all-around performer in both picture and video, and access to a system that allows you to improve on what you just purchased down the road. I think it is a great choice for all, but certainly for those just getting started."^5^Jan 6, 2020 5:13 PM

It kept the best of the 6000 while improving picture quality and adding some high-end features. Here are some initial thoughts after using this new camera for a couple of weeks.

Physically, the build quality is quite good with a substantial and rigid feel for a plastic body. The rear screen is now touch-enabled for focus and exposure and can pivot 180 degrees up allowing selfies or v-blogs. The OLED viewfinder is good but not a match to the higher resolution EVFs on Sonys more expensive models. There is a small pop up flash, but if you plan much flash use, Id recommend buying a separate TTL (smart) flash to attach to the cameras hot shoe. Overall it has a good feel in the hand, and the plastic construction makes it very light. Its numerous controls are well laid out except for a very awkwardly placed video button. On the minus side, I found it awkward to insert or remove SD cards since the slot is very close to the battery door hinge. It uses the small FW-50 battery and although battery life is reasonable, youll want to carry extras. Neither the body or kit lens is weather-sealed, so dont plan on using it in rainy or very dusty locations. Lastly, Sony chose to use a USB micro connection rather than the newer, better and more robust USB-C for in-camera charging and PC connection.
 

Internally, it uses Sonys proven 24mp APS-C sensor. Using Sonys current BIONZ X processor makes for fast picture processing. Burst mode can shoot at 11 frames per second and buffer up to 75 jpegs. The big news is that it now includes a 425 point focusing system with face and eye detection with real-time tracking. Thats a big step up in focus ability and arguably Sonys is the best in the industry. This same system is used in several of Sonys high-end mirrorless cameras. The focus is fast and accurate, and it will continuously track moving subjects and while maintaining focus. However, to make full use of this and many of the advanced features, you need to find your way through an extensive and somewhat obtuse menu system. This camera has the capabilities of many substantially higher priced cameras, but you have to be willing to investigate, read and learn to make use of all its power and features. Once you do, you can customize function buttons, build your own personal My Menu and customize the pop-up menu selections to quickly access the settings you change most often. It has every shooting, focusing, and exposure mode and picture setting you can imagine and probably more. It shoots in JPG, RAW, and RAW+JPG still formats. It records video up to 4K UHD while still continuously focusing. Its WIFI and Bluetooth enabled allowing you to send pictures directly to your phone, receive location info from your phone, or operate the camera remotely. Theres NFC built in to quickly connect your phone at a touch.

`
The 16-50mm kit lens has been around for a while and was designed to meet a price point and to be very small. It keeps the camera quite compact  more than pocket-size but much less than a DSLR or most superzooms. The 16-50mm zoom range is equivalent to a 24-75mm on a full-frame camera. Thats a reasonable walk-around lens, but keep in mind, its only a 3:1 zoom, so with this lens, youll have to do much of the zooming with your feet. It is stabilized, and since the camera does not have stabilization built-in, thats a real asset. With a maximum f-stop of 3.5 to 5.6, stabilization is needed for low to moderate light conditions if you want to keep the ISO and noise reasonable. This is packed into an amazingly small body  almost pancake size when off and not extended. The camera has very effective lens correction built-in so theres almost no image distortion throughout the zoom, but the corners get somewhat soft at the wide end. Ive read reports of variations in quality from unit to unit and some durability issues, but at this point, my lens is performing well. A faster f-stop and/or longer zoom would be more versatile. There are many excellent e-mount lenses that can be used with this camera, but good lenses are expensive. The a6100 is also available with an additional 70-210mm lens, and that may be worth considering if you want a longer zoom and are willing to carry an additional lens. Theres also a highly rated 18-135 Sony zoom Im considering.

Is this the camera for you? If you want extensive features, one of the best action tracking focusing systems, and great picture quality this gets you into an excellent mirrorless camera system at a modest price. If youre a serious photographer and want a small, walkabout camera with semi-pro features, its a solid choice. If all you want is a point and shoot camera and will leave it set on auto rather than make use of its capabilities, there are many other choices that may be more suitable.

All things said, theres a whole lot here to recommend. A lot of technology is packed into this compact body. At the price, this may be the best deal out there as far as features and price. If Sony would update the arcane menu system and improve the kit lens, it would easily get a 5-star rating from me. As is, it gets a high 4."^4^Jan 6, 2020 11:33 AM

I'm used to lager more user adjustable dslr cameras that are super Bulky. I like the smaller form factor of this mirrorless camera, it has a built in hot shoe for a larger higher quality flash then the tiny built in one. I say the built in flash is tiny, which it is, but it is useful for portraits and closer subjects. The rear display will fold up and down, but not out or swivel, which would be a nice feature to seemon a future model.

I like that the A6100 takes pics in 4K as well as video in 24p and 30p, just not the most desirable 60p. Which isn't a deal breaker imo for the reasonable price of 749.99 retail. The menu system imo, is very outdated, my older dslrs have the exact same menu system and neither of them are a Sony. This does capture great low light photography as well as video. The built in wifi and sony smartphone software to transfer photos to your phone is ok, I find it overly neccessary but many will like the feature and benefits of it.

My only complaints are the outdated menu system as well as poor battery life. Also I don't care for the fact the eye cup view finder isnt live, it's a small monitor, and the delay on it is terrible and irritating to me. I subtracted a star for the 3 cons. All in all I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a relatively reasonable priced mirrorless camera, and maybe buying some higher end lenses."^4^Jan 6, 2020 3:30 PM

And I was looking forward to upgrading a bit and having a tele lens option. 

I looked seriously at the Sony A6000 (my daughter likes hers) and A6300, but I was somewhat concerned with the % of people who had an issue with at least one of their lenses making reliable connection when in place. I was hoping to obtain a well rated mirror-less 2 lens kit for about $1000, which is asking a lot. When I looked over the Canon offerings, I had to get past the confusion of their numbering system. I considered the M6 (virtually the well rated M5 w/o a viewfinder). Then I sorted out that the M50, which just came out in 4/18, also had some great similar qualities (APS-C sensor), dual pixel focusing, and upgrades such as more focus points and newer Digic8 processing. The 4K video has numerous compromises, per many reviews, but I have no need for that level. I did pay attention to the more standard video settings having decent auto-focusing, which my G12 did not and was a sore point. 

I read many online reviews and felt I knew what I was getting. Canon does not get the kudos on mirror-less of some other brands, but it does get good marks for image quality and the various features. The key competitive negatives seemed to be the 4K video and the lower battery life / number of shots (not the same as the M6/M5, but still more than I use in a day). And the M50 has one main dial instead of two on many other cameras. Do check out the various online reviews for better understanding 

I was looking in early May and the price for the 2-lens kit (w/15-45 and 55-200mm) was at the initial list price of $900 camera w/15-45 plus $350 2nd lens, more than I preferred to spend. Those lenses are 24-72mm and 88-320m as 35mm camera equivalents. Some googling noted that Canon typically drops the price after some 6 months, but here they did it in 1 month, so the camera (next day) was lowered to $700 and the (typically $349) 2nd lens adds only $230, so the kit was $929. That got me headed to a nearby BB, which had the 2-lens kit. (That store did not even have it on display yet). 

I am quite happy with my initial experience. The paper manual is very compact so I recommend the downloadable pdf version. I do not think the single main dial (instead of two) will bother me. Many of the features are much like my G2; i.e., full Automatic, Program (to adjust flash for example), Time or Aperture priority, etc. I am having to figure out some key (for me) items such as where to get to the close-up setting, how to set up occasional auto exposure bracketing, how to vary flash output, etc. The small flash is good to around 15', so I was pleased that my older compact Canon hot-shoe 270EX flash is compatible.

Again, the 4K video is not generally rated for prime time due to its compromises. But if that does not matter to you either, this camera seems a good candidate vs the M5 in the Canon family, especially if upgrading from a non-DSLR Canon. While Canon did not get great marks on their slower push into mirrorless, I think this camera is a good quality / value proposition, especially if you (like me) might choose to rule out the Sony's. While you will find others with great ratings in the 'top 10' lists, some of those are also quite a few $ more. I think the current $929 2-lens kit is very reasonable and I hope to have my initial impressions pan out longer term.

I did puchase a pair of non-Canon supplemental batteries, some B&W UV haze/protective filters, and some nice elastic lens cap retainers. On those, I recommend the kind where the cord loops through holes in the cap (vs. the stick-on kind)."^5^May 20, 2018 3:10 PM

I did my research and considered a sony, panasonic, and this canon. I was upgrading from a canon t6, but did not mind the thought of a new ecosystem since I only had 3 lenses. In the end, this one me over. The phase detect AF is super quick as well as the burst picture speed. Picture quality is amazing with both of these lenses. I also got the mount adapter and my 50mm 1.8 also looks beautiful. The vari-angle screen, EVF, timelapse options, even the video is amazing (in 1080). I knew about the 4k limitations up front and wasn't concerned with them. The video quality from this camera with the right lenses in 1080p is amazing. I don't need 4k right now. If you do want 4k video, I'd say you really need to be looking at something else, but if that isn't a need for you right now, this is an amazing lightweight camera system. I consider it a steal for the price and the top of the line canon mirrorless currently. It may be missing a dial from the M5 or M6, but you can easily adjust almost anything on the touchscreen which makes up for it in my book. I couldn't be happier with my decision to purchase this camera. One other thing I would say, be cautious if you plan to use the adapter and ef or ef-s lenses. They add a lot of weight and make it very forward heavy. If that's not an issue for you, then go for it. The 50mm I tried gave me really nice shots compared to my T6."^5^Jul 8, 2018 11:12 PM

Photography is fun again with this small camera - I really don't want to lug around large camera bodies and lenses anymore!  The lenses auto focus ability is superior with the mirrorless system - no more need to calibrate the lenses to the mirror-type focus system (AF Micro adjustment). I must admit, the image quality, even with the kit lenses is terrific.  Of course without weather sealing and premium (L) lenses, one is limited. However, I have printed large format photos that only a professional would be able to tell the difference (pro cameras and lenses)  - and not always.  The sensor is very good, the Digic 8 processor is outstanding.  Using up to 1600 ISO often, the printed picture is just terrific and higher ISOs  (a little work in Adobe Lightroom!) For the advanced shooters, the new cRaw format is great to expanded post processing. The kit lenses are very capable and are very sharp - especially the center.  Of course, the kit lenses are pretty slow, so low light photos are going to require a higher ISO or flash. I used the 55-200 Zoom at a grandson's ball game with great results - up to 10 fps that is more than adequate to catch 'just the right shot'.  The EVF works well in bright daylight. The battery is adequate, but just so.  If traveling or videoing, a second battery is probably mandatory.  The video function is great - I only use 1080p to be able to use dual pixel focus.  My video is limited to grandkids school plays, so I can not provide a good opinion on the video capabilities for the VLoggers out there, but what I do turns out great. The audio preamp is quite good. I use a Rode VideoMicro and that works out great for sound quality - the external mic jack is a great feature on this camera.  The camera is small, but easy to hold and is 'carry all day' comfortable. I will add that I added a ef-m 22mm, f2 pancake lens - this little prime lens is reasonably fast and the image quality is very, very good and an ideal size when on the m50.  Do I miss my pro equipment?  Sure, sometimes, but I never miss lugging them around! For the casual shooters - travel, kids, etc. this is a very nice system, I think!"^4^Jun 28, 2019 5:13 PM

When I saw this mirrorless unit available for a great price I decided to give it a shot.

The first thing I noticed is that it has a similar OS as the rest of the Canon point and shoot line. Those in turn, came directly from the old AE1 and A1 cameras. The system is simple for former users, and would not confound a first time user. Canon has had the edge on user friendliness for 40 years, and it does not appear that they are ready to relinquish that lead soon.

I still enjoy using manual modes at times, and having had experience in the manner in which Canon handles this, the whole experience was a breeze. Again, first timers who wish to go 'off line' and try experimenting with manual, shutter or aperture priority modes will find this a pleasant surprise in ease of use.

I was not disappointed in the image quality. Although it has a compact sensor, which I swore I was going to avoid, and requires an adapter to work with the entire line of Canon lenses, I was impressed. No flares, no distortion at the edges and a great deal of detail from the compact lenses.

As a former professional, I am often discouraged by reviews of amateur equipment written by pros or former pros who somehow expect miracles at bargain prices.

- the new RF lenses seems a step ahead in usability, functions, and performance
- The control ring is a great addition. The adapter with the control is almost indispensable if you start shooting with the EOS R and EF lenses
- Portability - size, weight, and ergonomics - are excellent. Had to familiarize a little to the new button layout and slightly modify the grip, but overall feeling and maneuverability great
- I had some initial troubles configuring Bluetooth connectivity to enable GPS, but all sorted out. I consider GPS coordinates to be an integral part of a photo experience
- Shot 700+ RAW photos in roughly 3 hrs, and drained the entire battery. Lesson learned: will always keep a spare one with me
- need to familiarize with the focus system, but setting the Multi-Function bar to round-robin all AF modes seem logical, natural and a no brainer after few minutes

After some months, I can confirm the first impression. Actually, from an ergonomic perspective, I find the EOS R excellent, and the multi-function bar extremely useful and an integral part of the overall experience. I am looking forward to more RF lenses in the second half of 2019.

I usually shoot with a Canon 5D Mark iv and the Canon 1 D X mark II. I now consider the EOS R my first choice for travel, landscape, urban architecture, and portraits."^5^Nov 28, 2019 1:03 AM

The following day, I needed to use it on a professional job and did so without a problem. Ive used Canon equipment since the AE1. Allow ample time to get used to the blackouts in the EVF when shooting even if you turn off image playback. The ergonomics are very good except for the video recording button placement. The camera is extremely customizable. Its easy to accidentally touch settings in error (i.e.: the video mode button is also the info button on the touchscreen. Really?) Most users hate the touchbar. It didnt work as intuitively as Canon claims. The image quality is excellent as expected from Canon equipment. The camera looks good on paper but Im still undecided.

I dont think a lot of people realize that. That is major when you want to move your camera or subject/object and have the camera focus follow it.

The EOS R is different than the SLR or DSLR. Some good, some frustrating.
PROS
The basics you know still apply. Shutter, FStop, ISO
- Lens from your old Canon will (mostly) still work as well as the lens did on your old Canon.I saw no need to upgrade my lens.
- ISO performance is great with acceptable noise even at 10,000. 80D can't do that.
- Shots per second and shutter speed are mostly the same
- Still has the very useful articulated flip screen
- You can see menus and review pictures in the high res digital view finder. Very Nice!
- Almost every button is programmable. Geeks will like this.
- The grip is a little deeper on your finger tips so it is very nice to carry with one hand.
- A little lighter than the big DSLR cameras. If you want a large camera body to impress your friends, this is not it.
CONS
- Price. $2500 with the adapter. A big price for the new features but a Geek has to follow the technology. (wife does not agree)
- No flash. Just hot shoe. I miss the pop up flash. Even with impressive ISO, a quick flash is often helpful.
- The digital view finder can be annoying. Pop up reviews and sleep settings to preserve energy, waste valuable time between shots. A show stopper in sports photography. Turn those things off.
- Hours you will spend watching youtube videos to learn the menu system and make the camera your own. Just when you had learned your old Canon.
- Video is still doable, but they moved a very convenient button to a very inconvenient location. I just don't get it.
- A new touch bar that you drag your finger on or touch correctly to do what ever you program it to do. Guess I'll learn it but is weird for now.
- Just 'feels' a bit slow when you move it from your lap to your eye to catch an interesting moment of action in the big game. The 80D may have the advantage so I set the EOS R view- finder to never sleep and auto focus always on so the camera is ready for action but using more battery full time. Best on a mono-pod kept at eye level to reduce the time between 'I want the shot' to 'I got the shot'.
If you are a Nikon or Sony or Fugi user, Not worth the Switch.
I love Canon and have a bunch of Canon stuff so I'm ok with it.

Photo and video quality is excellent, and with the basic converter, I can use all of my EF lenses. Just shot my first wedding (photos) using the EOS R along with my 5D4. The EOS R images look great, and I actually got a higher percentage of keepers with the R: Autofocus is really excellent. I've also shot a bit of video with the R. I find the video looks great, but auto white balance can wander a bit... so I use a specific Kelvin temperature for my white balance whenever possible. I'm also finding that my SD card sticks a bit when I try to remove it from the camera. Not sure what is causing that.

Took to Buenos Aires on vacation - it takes awesome shots, lots of new features. Lightweight - although the R lens are big and heavy. Mid-way thru my trip in a rain down pore - the camera got wet despite protective plastic protective sleeve coving most of the computer - somehow the electronics stopped working. After a day of drying up most buttons and features seemed to return except the shutter. Luckily after a call to support they suggested i use the touch screen to shoot. Not optimal but it allowed me to take photos the rest of the trip. Upon returning home i shipped the camera back to canon for repair. There was a disconnect with requesting a repair and whether it was subject to the canon care plus warranty. Initially they billed me for $600 for corrosion. When i pointed out that i had the care plus package i got a revised no cost quote. The care plus package had some contradictory descriptions on what is and isnt covered. It should water damage as subject to coverage but also states that it isnt. Anyway, they are not charging me. I should have the camera back in 5 days. Will update my review.

GeorgeH^/canon-eos-r-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6298167?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"I've been a Canon shooter for many years and have found their photography equipment to be of high quality, durable and reliable.  Canon also has outstanding customer service and support.  In addition to my recent purchases of two Canon EOS R bodies, I also have a 5D Mark IV, 7D Mark II and the holy trinity collection of Canon 'L' lenses.  

In my opinion, the 'R' has received a bad rap from supposedly professional reviewers, especially with Canon's recent firmware updates that have made significant improvements since the R's initial introduction.

Pros: 
1.  The body feels so good in the hand, not too large and not to small.  Just right!  Lenses balance well on the body.
2.  Image quality (stills) is outstanding and more than enough dynamic range to deal with highlights and shadows.
3.  I'm probably biased, but I think Canon's color science is the best in the industry.
4.  Fast and accurate auto focus especially with the recent 1.4 firmware update.  Subject tracking and eye detection is excellent.
5.  The EF/EF-S to R lens adapter allows you to use all of the EF/EF-S lenses with no loss in functionality.
6.  The electronic viewfinder resolution is outstanding and the ability to see exactly what your image will look like before taking the shot is a game changer versus an optical viewfinder on a DSLR.
7.  The articulating LCD screen is high resolution and allows you to get the shot at any difficult angle.
8.  If you have the funds I also recommend the new Canon RF lenses.  I also purchased the RF 24-105mm f/4L lens and it is outstanding and a great focal length for a walk-around lens.
9.  The touch & drag function to move the focus point is much speedier than a joy stick and is easy to use.
10.  Shooting in lowlight conditions is outstanding and very minimal noise in higher ISO ranges.

Cons:
1.  Some complain about only having a single card slot which I can understand if you're a paid photographer.  However, if you need redundancy you can use wifi to easily send to your cell phone as you shoot.
2.  Some have complained about the crop factor when using 4K video.  I don't do video with my cameras so really not fair of me to comment.

Here are the things I like:
-Great picture quality
-Silent Shutter
-Works with my 24-70 f2.8 II, 70-200 f2.8IS II and other lenses without a problem with the adapter.
-Single point single shot Autofocus works great.
-MOST of the time face detection with Eye detection works.
-Ring on the adapter(Sold separately), I have set ut up for Aperture, I really like this even though the ring is a bit to close to the camera.
-The FV mode is probably my favorite new feature.
-Great battery life, not sure how they measure the battery life for the specs, but I am getting an average of 900 photos per charge.
-Touch Screen as good as the 5d iv

Things that I need to get used to
-Touch and Drag autofocus
-Multi-function bar, I have programmed it to ISO, left side ISO 100, right side ISO 3,600, it works.

Things that need improvement:
-Face Autofocus, it works great 90% of the time, but sometimes just decides that the hands or a chair are the face.
-The touch and drag autofocus can be more responsive, meaning when I touch the screen while looking through the viewfinder the to change the focus point sometimes I need to swipe a few times to get to the point I want. I have tested different options, like mapping the screen to 1/4, to 1/2 to absolute and relative. It works but not as good as it could!
-Bursts silent shooter.
-More options to customize the buttons. For example, I would like to not only program the back button for Back Button Focus but to go to specify what type of autofocus (single/servo, single point or different areas, etc...)

The processing sensor is wonderful and all the controls are wonderful and easy to use.

Cons: No IBIS, 4k crop, no wide array of native lens selection yet... 

I love my camera. The photos that come out of it are beautiful once you figure it out and the 1080p looks better than a lot of its competitors 4k. While it lacks in some areas it makes up for in others and they are going to save those cons for their next camera. While the Lense selection is thin right now, RF lenses will be the new set of widely used lenses in years to come.

Pros:
Cheaper Price (Comparing to 5DIV)
Light weight
Focus Area

Cons:
1. Body looks weaker like 6D, 80D, or rebel series. not strong as 5D/7D series. so buttons not comfortable for longer shoots.

2. Touch bar is not comfortable, would prefer buttons instead, useless  to me.
3. Image preview in viewfinder too. have to press the button to leave preview image after every click. its really annoying. I tried to turning it off completely. it turns off in both display screen and view finder.
4. There is glitch with External Flash (I use Canon 530EX). ISO turns to Auto mode and it goes to 1600 automatically. It happens randomly. couldn't replicate when I try to reach customer care.
5. Single memory card slot

Photolover^/sony-alpha-a7r-iv-ilce-7rm4-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/6361762?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^1^"I'm coming from a Nikon d850, D3 and D500.  I tried a Sony A7III and it was ok but this camera what made me switch from the Nikon system.  The details are incredible. I take lots of wildlife photos as well as portraits.  

Pro: 
1. High Megapixel allows a ton of work in the post especially cropping. This is useful for wildlife photos when you are limited by the lens. High pixels is useful for me because I do a lot of composited images. 
2.  Autofocus is better than a7III.  It is substantially better than Z6.  The accuracy is very reliable for most situations.  The only time it failed was on the fastest of my four dogs.  It works for most wildlife situations.  For sports, I would still recommend the A9.
3.  The body is a huge step up from previous generations. 
4. EVF is incredible at 5.76m resolution. It also allows me to see the exposure live. 
5. Compact, light, powerful and incredibly sharp.  
6. Low Cost for this quality and performance is insane. This competes with the medium format hybrids from Fujifilm and Hasselblad.  



Cons:
1. low light focus still isn't perfect.  By this, I mean I had a very fast-moving dog running around in a cloudy evening.  Invest in a good Speedlite or strobe. The ISO does pretty well for most situations. 
2. You better have a fast computer.  These are very large files if you shoot raw.  I purchased a diskless raid array
3. I'm still not 100% on Sony colors. It appears underexposed and less on the magenta and yellow.  I will say this is not oversaturated like the A7III.  
4. The body still feels cheap next to the NIKON Z7. It almost feels hollow but light.  I realize it is still an improvement on a7iii.  LCD- Resolution of 1.4M doesn't cut it in 2020. It also lacks pinch zoom and touchable lcd.  

This is a very critical review and in spite of all of it, it is still the best all-around professional mirrorless camera on the market."^5^Dec 30, 2019 10:59 PM

I couldn't be happier with the RIII, but needed a backup so bought the A7iii when it came out, thinking it will play second fiddle. Was I wrong! A7iii is the little brother who outruns the older brother a little too often. If you want to see where the A7Riii ranks amongst other full frames, do some research. You will find most experts put it above the venerable 5DMk4 and tied with the D850. Well, in many ways, the a7iii beats the a7riii. Focus coverage is better. If you like shooting wildlife or sports, the a7iii's focusing system is more closely related to the 'biggest brother' a9, than the a7riii, and it's the one you want. a7riii has amazing iso performance and dynamic range and blows its Canon counterparts out of the water, well the a7iii is better in this department too. File management with a7riii 43mp file (80mb uncompressed RAW) can be difficult, and the 24mp on the a7iii hits the sweet spot for most photographers. It matches the a7riii's great 10fps burst rate, which according to most reviews is double to triple what Canon's and Nikon's new full-frame mirrorless can do in real world. Any camera deserving of the 'Pro' label requires dual memory slots. Hard drives go bad, solid state drives go bad, xqd cards go bad, and yes, sd cards go bad. I have been using digital cameras now for about 18 year, and I have had card failures about 6 times. Some may say that doesn't seem frequent enough to be worrying about it. Imagine saying that to your grandparents, who asked you to shoot their 50th anniversary, and that's when the card error happens.. worse yet, imagine being responsible for someone's wedding pictures. Well, unlike it's Canon and Nikon mirrorless counterparts, the a7iii has you covered in this department too, so you can have instant backups of all your pictures. So, what's the catch? Well, there is no perfect camera, and this one is no exception. The LCD screen on the a7riii is nothing to write home about, and the a7iii has it worse. The viewfinder on the a7riii is amazing, while on the a7iii, it's kind of okay. Unlike its Canon counterpart, its LCD screen does flip towards the front of the camera (only tilts up and down), so if you are looking for a camera for vlogging, look at Canon. Bottom line, the shortcomings of this camera are not related to the quality of pictures that you take with this camera. A so, so, LCD screen will not impact what people will see as your pictures."^5^Nov 14, 2018 3:19 PM

Sharma76^/sony-alpha-a7-iii-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6213101?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"At this point, I have had the A7iii for a couple months now and have clicked roughly 3000 images - mainly of family, pets, and my 6 months old babygirl. I can honestly say that these are some of the best images I have ever clicked and that this camera has helped elevate my photography to a whole new level. I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat!

A little background and more details... 

I had been a dedicated Canon user for 10+ years with 70D (APS-C sensor) for my last camera. Unfortunately that camera had front and back focusing issues even though I had micro-adjusted all my lenses to it. I was so used to clicking 3-4 extra images for those can't-miss moments just to be sure one of them was a keeper. 

Earlier this year, I decided to go full-frame and lucky for me, Sony had just announced the A7iii with features that were years ahead of anything Canon/Nikon had to offer at similar price point. After weeks of reading rave reviews from pros and amateurs alike, I pulled the trigger and ordered my A7iii along with the 24-70GM lens. After 2 months of using Sony gear, I couldn't be happier with my move. 

Here are a few pros and cons that you may not find in other reviews.

Pros:
- Eye AF: The hype is real! The Eye AF works (90% of the time) incredibly well and makes it super easy to take portraits. With it on, most pictures are so razor-sharp that I can zoom into the eyes of the subject and find my own reflection. And that's not an exaggeration!

- Excellent Low-light capability: On my Canon, I rarely pushed past 1000 ISO because of high noise in low-light images. With A7iii, I haven't purchased a flash yet so I am regularly forced to shoot in 10,000 - 12,500 range and the images still looking stunning after processing.

- Less time in post-processing: Compared to 70D, I find that less of my images need post-processing now and the ones I do have to process take less time. 

- File size: At one point, I was seriously considering the A7(R)iii but now I am glad that I chose this camera. The 50MB files (uncompressed RAW) from this camera already make my 2014 Macbook Pro feel slightly sluggish. Can't imagine what 80-90MB files from A7Riii would have done to my computer. 

Cons: 
- Sony software is worthless: the RAW processing software installed 3 different apps - a photo manager, an editor and a remote shooting app. I found the apps a pain to use so ended up uninstalling after the first week and purchased Capture One Pro. 

- No built-in flash: I personally miss having a built-in flash. In most low-light situations, I could take out my 70D from the bag and start snapping in seconds. I don't own an external flash for A7iii but past experience tells me it will definitely take longer to get snapping when I have to attach an external flash. 

With all that said, I still rate this camera a solid 5 stars because of the incredible difference it has already made in my photos."^5^Sep 16, 2018 7:51 PM

This camera has wonderful low light capabilities and is a dream to work with when it comes to shooting real estate photography.  

RAW photos combined with 5-9 bracketed allows for wonderful HDR photography.

For video purposes, I've paired the Sony XLR-K2M by connecting it via the Multi-Interface Shoe Adapter - allows me to capture 2 channels of audio and feeds directly off the battery.

Lastly, I'd have to say the biggest improvement with Sony's line of mirrorless cameras has to be the extended battery life...now I've taken it a step further and added a 2nd battery using the Sony VG-C3EM Vertical Grip.  This gives me hours of usage for both 4K video and photography.

All in all, it's a great camera and I'm glad I purchased it when I did.  I found an excellent open-box deal down in Fort Lauderdale and saved 25% off MSRP.

The lens I'm using is the SONY 16-35mm f/4, I opted for the f/4 over the f/2.8 because I felt the reason I'm purchasing this camera in the first place is for low light sensitivity, so I just push the ISO up a bit more and it works just fine.

TimH^/sony-alpha-a7-iii-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6213101?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"This is A7iii is my second Sony camera. My other Sony is A77II. As much as I have enjoyed that camera it isn't even in the same realm. The images this camera produces are beautiful. I find the camera to be very user friendly with the exception of the menu system. I watched several videos on how to use/set the menu up and although those few hours were a bit dry did help me become confident in using the DEEP menu structure. The A7iii ability to gather light is nothing less than spectacular. The auto focus is as close to instantiations as seems possible as well as very accurate. I have not shot any video with it yet, so I will leave those functions to others to comment on. The body is a bit small for my hands especially when paired with the 24-70 2.8 GM lens which is my only lens as this time. I felt the need to purchase a third party grip right away since I didn't feel very confidant in the grip I had with the enormous lens. The ability to set custom functions to several buttons makes many common tasks easy. I do miss the fully articulating screen of my other camera but I usually use the EVF anyway. The A7iii and A7Riii both have some firmware issues at the time of this review which have caused me to be unable to view pictures I have taken in camera. Yes that is frustrating but having read several articles I believe Sony will be releasing a Firmware update in the next week or two which will fix this bug. This is the sole reason I didn't give this camera a 5 star review. The lack of an included dedicated charger, while annoying was not a major issue for me since I knew about it before purchasing my camera so ordered a charger at the same time. The menu structure while very DEEP allows a lot of customization which I appreciate. This camera allows the user to create their own menu for the settings which one most frequently uses and that is brilliant! I was disappointed Sony did not include a PC sync port on this camera but the Sony wireless adapter has one on it, so not a major problem. The battery life is better than any camera I have ever had including several Cannons I had before switching to Sony. All in all I am very happy with this camera and encourage anyone on the fence to give this wonder a shot."^4^Dec 12, 2018 1:42 PM

I generally shoot studio and location portraits. However, the camera ergonomics and user interface feel like someone that has never used a camera before designed them. Expect to buy a battery charger at an additional $88 because the camera does not come with one. The in-body USB battery charging is painfully slow.

drew^/sony-alpha-a7-iii-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6213101?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The good:
As full frame cameras go it's a great price. I've been very happy with the image quality and video capabilities. The battery life is significantly better than my A6500 crop sensor Sony. The build quality is also top notch.

The OK
You've already probably heard about the terrible menu, terrible manual and lack of touch screen menu interaction. That actually doesn't bother me quite as much as it does other reviewers. There are tons of setup guides for it on Youtube and tons of customization with the hardware buttons and with the Fn menu. There are a few things I want to put on the Fn menu that I can't, but overall once it's setup to your liking it's pretty easy to operate.   

The Bad:
No flip out screen. I mean, c'mon, that's been a staple of DSLR's for decades. Also, no charger in the box. If I'm dropping 2 grand on a camera body, you could either go ahead and provide one or just raise the price by $5 or $10. I guarantee nobody will notice that as much as they notice having to plug the body in to charge.

The worst:
Sony really needs to get their act together with regards to software. Most camera companies turn out some pretty bad software but Sony really takes the cake here and in fact seems to be worse now than it was a couple years ago with my a6500. Transferring images to a mobile device is a hassle. Getting them to the computer relentlessly is a hassle. The NFC connection setup doesn't seem to work at all regardless if you're on Apple or Android. And this brings me to my final point:

This camera is not platform agnostic. It, at least as of this review works MUCH BETTER on Android. I can't even get the app to connect to the camera on my iphone XS with everything updated, and a few months ago when I could, getting it to do so was a pain and only sort of worked. On my Samsung Galaxy S 10: no problem. Connected and working like a charm."^4^Jul 7, 2019 8:48 PM
Emat2000^/sony-alpha-a7-iii-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6213101?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"To start off, I want to give this camera 5 stars based off performance but there are little quirks that keep from being so. The menu system is a little bit complicated to find small changes you want to make. Thankfully they have a function in the menu that allows you to customize the important features for quick customization, in addition to the customizable buttons the camera has. Mainly though, my biggest gripe is the lack of a full articulating screen on the back. I wish Sony would design the screens in mind for bloggers like canon does. Having it flip upside down isnt enough for those who use a microphone. The autofocus for facial recognition is fantastic so there is a work around. I want to give this a 4.5 but its not possible on this forum. The camera is a great bargain for the cost."^4^Jun 30, 2019 6:25 PM

Heres what was actually good about the camera...
 AF was very fast with native lenses.
 Sensor has very low noise.
 Video has a ton of good features and works fairly well.

Heres whats not so good about the camera.

 The Meter is not in sync with the capabilities of the sensor and things that should be better handled by the meter often leave you with lost data in the Highlights (I know how to use a cameras meter, this one is just very liberal with its settings).

 Skin tones are among the worst Ive ever had in a camera and two other people who bought this camera reached out to me to tell me they felt the same way.

 Eye Auto Focus only works if the subject is facing the camera and even then it depends heavily on the lens for locking on. As soon as your subject turns their head at even the slightest angle away from the camera, it is unable to get a lock on the visible eye. 

 Sony set the contrast so low in the images, in order to get a bette Dynamic Range out of the camera, that you literally have to use their best lenses (with great microcontrast) in order to get a decent looking image out of the camera. 

 Another point of failure is the fact that the camera doesnt come with an external battery charger and that creates major issues where youre likely to snap the door off while trying to charge the camera via the plug that was provided. 

 Even more, the menu driven controls has you going through about 100 pages of controls just to configure the camera. Its one of the worst menu systems youll ever use and this is compounded by the ridiculously poor content in the cameras manual! The literally layout the whole camera menu system in the manual and fail to thoroughly explain several settings.

There's a lot said about the G7 in a hundred different places on the internet, so I'll only reiterate in slight.

For the price point, you get a ton of features. The video quality is pretty much the same as the GH4, so if you want to tighten up your budget and get more accessories, go for this one. You'll lose audio out, and v-log, the metal build of the GH4, weather sealing, 96 FPS slow motion shooting, and a few 4k settings, but I have yet to be affected by this.

Smartphones rule. My Samsung S7 is amazing including credible 4K video capture included. But hold on a minute. Need a longer focal range, want real soft focus blurred bokeh. You are out of luck. Low light performance is okay, not great. That tiny sensor is the reason there. This camera still to a lesser extent has that issue too. More later.

Body and Handling
Excellent placement of the programmable buttons, and mode dials of which there are 2. Canon, and Nikon say make do with 1. Tough! Price point folks. The flip screen with tilt is a joy too. Plenty sharp, and easy in most lighting conditions, and color rich. Full touch enable focus, and menu functions, and much much more, make the handling a joy,not a bust unlike my D7100, and other DSLR cameras that bury it all in menus. The light body is a great go everywhere camera for Vloggers your ship has arrived. The grip is great for Gorilla hands like mine. But still small, and light enough for petite hands. The Terrific EVF is a joy to see your image work with, and the playback too! It is well contrasted, and detailed to give you great information on your composition. You cannot do that on a DSLR Pentaprism system. Also the small lens size form factor is great. Though some lenses may approach APS-C size lenses, but I will rarely need those anyway. So no hit there. This is my adventure camera while it will not necessarily be about the far away things for now, it is about sharing my video adventures with my audience, not so much about still images. Coming back to the controls, and buttons, the layout is perfection. Customization buttons allow you to create the just right instant control that is right for your workflow, or preference. Everything is where I expect it even without reading the manual, though I did anyway read it.

Image Quality
Images in great bright light are excellent, in low light, it will not beat the Sony a6300 or other APS-C cameras, nor did I expect it, but with a Metabones speed adapter, and fast glass, this will not be an issue for long. Color is vibrant, and the white balance accuracy excellent. Detail is quite good. Though I want to get more with primes. The 30mm Sigma Art lens in an f1.7 is next on the list. The Rokinon Cinema glass is next too. 
Focus is contrast detect, so this is not for real fast sports. It is slower, but I didn't really find it a problem for me. Also note that Micro four thirds has a 2 to 1 crop. So a 30mm lens is really 60mm on this system.

Video is outstanding. Couldn't be easier or more fun. The built in microphones are merely adequate just like any camera with built mics, and so so preamplifiers. I use my Tascam DR-100 mk.3 SD audio recorder for the important must have great audio in the videos, and marry in post. The Zebra Pattern, and Focus Peaking, and other unexpected video tools are welcome at this price, and the leveling tool makes setup with my tripod which lacks a spirit level a breeze. Use a Vlog selfie tool, or Joby minipod for your vlog work, and you have the start of a great vlog sharing camera.

So who is this camera for?
A beginner into an anything do it all camera they want to expand, and grow with. It is for someone who hates big cameras, heavy cameras, and is not likely to take those beasts of burden with them. Or the complexity of DSLRs with their nested menus. 
This camera fits in my center console easily. Cannot say that with my Nikon D7100, D200, D70s, Pentax K5mk.2, or KS-2. This one is so handy. Also for folks with small hands, for students in school who are doing vlogs for their yearbook, or social pages, and such. Or anyone wanting to do a vlog. This camera comes with a Mic Jack for external Rode mics, or whatever for better sound. So while certainly not perfect, this little camera that can, and does, makes me happy I have it, and don't want a bulky DSLR ever again. The promise of mirrorless delivered perfectly. Color me impressed. You will too! Thanks for reading."^5^Jul 30, 2017 5:14 PM

I've been using a traditional DSLR for the last couple of years now. The Lumix G7 technology is entirely new to me, and at first I was a little bit intimidated by all of the options and having to learn new technology. After a few weeks with this camera, I still feel like I am just scraping the surface of what it can do!

I reach for this camera when I want to take action shots of the kids. The 4K mode allows you to take several seconds (or up to 30 minutes) of video. You can break the video down into about 30 frames per second, and pull any of those images from the video without losing any quality. So, I can get a little video of my child jumping and then look at every frame and pick the ones that catch that exact moment I was looking for - which makes for some seriously amazing photos!

Also super handy is the Panasonic app that allows you to connect your device to the camera and download the photos of your choice directly to your phone. This makes it super easy to share your pictures online, because you don't need to go through the whole process of downloading them all on to you computer before you can share them (although I have done that, too, for editing purposes).

This camera is exciting - it takes my photography to another level and really lets me capture movement in a new way."^5^Jul 20, 2015 5:18 PM

As someone who has a camera with me at all times, the struggle is always between whether I want quality pictures or I want lightweight options, because up until now there was no real compromise in my eyes. But, in my never-ending search for a lighter weight camera, I earmarked the Lumix G7 because it has interchangeable lenses as well as being mirrorless (which is quite possibly my favorite advance in cameras in the recent years). The fact that it has a touch-enabled screen so it is really user-friendly was the tipping point. But it wasnt until I tried it that I truly fell in love.

The Lumix G7 totally blew me away in the DSLM (M= Mirrorless) category and took away the bulk and weight of traditional DSLRs without sacrificing image quality. In fact, it has so many features that I adore that its now my most-used camera because it can do everything I need but can fit easily in my purse or diaper bag for days out without the gear.

Some of my favorite features I didnt even know I needed:
 The 4K shooting modes that allow you to shoot Ultra HD Video taken at up to 30 frames-per-second. Once you have your 4K file taken, you can extract individual frames and save them as an 8-megapixel still image right from the back of the camera so you never miss that perfect moment. No more head swapping in Photoshop because everyone blinked or looked away at the wrong moment because the 4K mode takes all the guesswork out of timing the perfect photo.
 The Micro 4/3 lens system that makes for some super tiny lenses that pack a big punch. While I dont adore the lens it came with straight out of the box (14-42), I do love that its clear, it has good range, and it is impossibly small.
 The touch-enabled monitor will be your best friend. You can change most everything simply by touching the screen back and choosing settings from there, including selecting those 4K images for saving. You can also focus right from the screen so you can simply tap what you want crystal clear and let the camera do the rest.
 The iAuto setting that automatically adjusts and selects the correct scene setting so you can get the best picture on the fly. Ive never tried an Auto setting I liked, even on my super expensive cameras Ive owned or rented, but I truly love the iAuto setting on the Lumix G7 for life with fast-moving kids. I can simply flip on the camera, set it to iAuto and shoot away and I almost always end up with gorgeous shots.
 Built-in Wi-Fi to share all your beautiful photos on the fly. The Lumix G7 allows me to share right to my cell phone or tablet on the fly via the Lumix app.

While I could go on and on about all the features I love, in the interest of brevity, I should just say that I adore this camera. It allows me to capture that perfect moment easily, which is perfect for the adventures we go on as a family as well being a great secondary camera for work without adding 10 pounds to my gear. It is so small that it slips easily into my purse or backpack, which means I can always have it with me to grab at a moments notice. If you are sick of all the closed eye shots, or pictures where your child is a mere blur across the image but you cant take a huge DSLR with you everywhere, you will adore this little camera as much as I do."^5^Jul 21, 2015 12:49 AM

The Panasonic LUMIX G7 gives this to me and more. The Panasonic LUMIX G7 is a lightweight, stylish camera with a touch-enabled monitor. I liked having the option of using touch. This is my first mirrorless camera and it was easy to learn on once you learned the different modes. What is new and amazing is the 4K HD modes. My sons play lacrosse and it is a fast-moving sport so catching that right moment can be tough. However with Panasonic LUMIX G7 4K photo modes, my favorite is the pre-burst, I never miss that moment! With the 4K photo modes I am able to catch a succession of clear, beautiful photos and choose the right ones that get that right moment like when my son shoots a goal. Also, the Panasonic Image app is super easy to use and great for when I want to upload and share their pics instantly. I received a Panasonic LUMIX G7 camera.

I essentially just take a video with the 4K setting and can then use it for video and photos. By going back through the video, I can pick out the exact frames that I want for pictures. Clear, amazing pictures, frame after frame after frame.

So I never miss the perfect moment when my kids are playing sports or moving quickly. And I get video at the same time. All in a more compact camera than the one Ive been dragging around for years. Its seriously awesome!

I received product samples as well as a promotional item to thank me for my participation.

I recently received a Panasonic LUMIX G7 camera and while I'm still getting comfortable with it, I already know I love it! The 4K feature is key for capturing the good stuff, those quick moments where smile are biggest, eyes are brightest and time has really stood still. The first time I used the camera, I wasn't familiar with how to use the 4K feature. But I loved the photos that I took just the same. The camera is lightweight and easy to take with you on whatever adventures you are setting out on. It's much less intrusive than when I bring my big DSLR camera. It is now the only camera I will take with me on a trip or even just heading out on an outing with my kids. And then I learned a little more about the 4K mode. I'm hooked! Shooting in 4K felt a little odd for me since I'm used to shooting the moment with a click of the shutter. Since we were at the beach, and the kids were playing in the water, I decided to try out the 4K Start/Stop mode. What this means is that you are basically taking short videos where you can then extract the perfect image after the fact! As I sat down with my camera once we got home from that trip, and really started to go through the footage, it became clear that this is THE way to shoot when you are taking picture of active children. I got some amazing shots of the kids in the waves that I would never have gotten in a regular mode. To be able to scroll through these videos, frame by frame, with the touch screen monitor is awesome. I was able to save some truly special moments captured this way. The fact that this camera has wifi and you can share you photos immediately is too cool and I'm beyond excited to play around with the Panasonic Image App which means I can control the camera from my phone! This technology is truly changing photography and how moms capture their kids!"^5^Jul 16, 2015 6:46 PM

The G7 has very fast focusing and produces wonderful JPEGs, something Panasonic camera's have not always done in the past.

A great set of configurable external control buttons and wheels allow quick control of the shot parameters.

Panasonic has a lot of experience with 4K video and the G7 shows the results. With the 4K photo, you can extract frames from video at 30 shots per second, which allows you to capture just the right moment.

The one missing feature on this camera is in-body stabilization. You need to have stabilized lenses with the G7 and the result is not as good as what Olympus is producing in their stabilized bodies, such as the OMD-EM5 MkII."^4^Jul 24, 2015 5:16 PM

It's small and compact yet easy to hold and grip with confidence. It is very light and a bit plastic yet robust and not like a toy at all. Micro 4/3 comes with challenges such as finding a wide enough lens in order to deal with the crop factor. I was able to find a fairly inexpensive 9mm Olympus lens (which seems like a toy) and that becomes a 18mm equivalent as on a full frame sensor camera. Being a mirrorless camera makes it able to adapt many lens types such as old manual Canon FD lenses. Images can look super cool and with a wide open aperture, you can get some very nice 'boke' as a result of shallow depth of field. The kit lens does perform well and yes, the auto focus is not super quick like the new Sony cameras. I wouldn't use this to film fast moving subjects or sport events. It does shoot 4K and the images are stunning! The video is very crisp and the color is pleasing. It doesn't have the magenta tint Sony cameras seem to have. It doesn't have the golden richness of the Canon's either. Panasonic is in a nice place in the middle. Of course you can change things in the edit, but it's nice having great color right out of the camera. There are some excellent guides out there that will help you set the camera for 'filming' video. This thing is a brilliant little 4K camera that's very affordable compared to its big brothers (G4 and G5, G5s, and G9). May not have all the features as they do but at this price point, it pack a pretty considerable punch with light weight and wide range of adaptability, the G7 is not only super for video but awesome for on-the-go picture taking. 

The swivel monitor swings out and can be tilted in many directions. So selfies or vlogging is easier than with most other cameras. 

There a is a con: the battery door. It's on the bottom and can be difficult to place on a tripod because the plate can cover and block the door. Also the SD card is in the same compartment as the battery instead of on the side. This can be cumbersome to switch out a card or battery.

Now since i didnt really play around too much with the photo performance i cannot really tell if the g7 is a great camera for pictures or not but ive shot some pictures with it and i was pretty happy with the result. i tried manual then auto both resulting in good pictures as is without post editing. now the cons about this camera to me are only the build quality and the pretty slow auto fucusing when shooting video, but those are not enough reasons for me to not giving this camera 5 star. they say you get what you pay for but for me, i got more then what ive paid for this little amazing camera to be honest. not too long after i purchased the g85 came out! so unfortunatelly i had to exchange it with the g85 ( Thank you best buy for the hassle free return policy that cannot be beat!!) just because of its 5 axis in body stabilization which is AMAZING! Well Now thats going to be another review i suppose!LOL
If you can find this camera for a discounted price or on sale and you are looking for your very first camera for mainly video rather than photos get this! if you care so much more about photo than video, well maybe this camera is not for you look for canon or nikon or even sony cameras. good luck and have a great day!"^5^Jan 9, 2018 9:19 AM

I've owned Canon and Sony systems. I do both stills and video. I had heard a lot of misconceptions about m43 systems, such as bad lowlight performance, no shallow depth of field, reduced dynamic range, etc.

The same week I bought this I got a generic Nikon focal reducer off eBay. I own a bunch of vintage manual lenses. My favorite combo has been a 35mm Nikkor AI F2, which becomes an effective Super 35 (or APSC) equivalent (yay bokeh). With the focal reducer, I used it at ISO 3200 in a dark club for stills and video. Yes they were a bit noisy, but the 4K files downscaled nicely to 1080p. 

Some of my favorite pictures have been with this camera and that 35mm lens as well.

Its also very reliable as its never overheated on my on long shoots. The autofocus is meh for video. Speakyof which, the included kit lens is light, sharp, has good contrast and color, and its stabilized. Its definitely outgunned by the Olympus 12-40 f2.8 pro in terms of color and highlights but still decent. 

The 4K files are relatively small and editable even on my mid-2014 15in MacBook Pro using FCPX. 

The controls are very straight forward and intuitive. Theres a dial or button for everything, as well as a really good touch screen that flips out.

The WiFi controls are a lot more useful than even on a Sony as you have full control over all settings, even touch to focus.

I am quite happy with the transition. The camera has a little bit of a learning curve (many functions and customization). Once you nail down what buttons are what, setting up the shot through the electronic viewfinder is a dream. The touchscreen is super fast and responsive. My primary use is videography and night time photography where my previous camera struggled. The G7 does super well in various conditions and I really enjoy its size - just small enough for basic portability, and big enough to do force you to frame your shots. I did get a mic attachment and several magnifier attachments to do macro nature photography. While the body is mostly plastic, the form factor is lightweight yet durable that it strikes a good balance in quality confidence. I've attached a couple of test shots I took."^5^Mar 18, 2018 2:32 PM

The image quality is truly outstanding, given the size of the sensor. The things you can do with this camera are amazing. Video is, of course, excellent. It is kind of a perfect grab-n-go alternative to my Canon. Also, it is very easy to use alternative lenses. Very satisfied. By the way, I returned a Sony A6000 because I could never warm up to it. I think that the Sony cameras are very overpriced given the quality and features they offer.

I bought it for making videos for our YouTube channel, and it's been a complete success at that (more than 50 finished videos so far), plus it makes excellent still photos. PLUSES: Produces pro-level HD and 4K video. VERY light, VERY affordable, but not cheaply made or designed. Will do about 80-90% of what the flagship Panasonic GH5 will do for about 30% of the price (and 50% of the weight). Easy to learn, easy to use, good software, well laid-out controls. Panny is the world leader in mirrorless hybrid photography. MINUSES: Mostly plastic (but high quality plastic), not the diecast alloy chassis of the GH5, G9, GH5s, G85. Not water-sealed/dust-sealed/frostproof/etc. like those more expensive (and heavier) cameras, and certainly not as durable. Doesn't have an audio out jack for monitoring sound as you record, though it does have audio input for an external mic (which I always use). (Not a deal-breaker: NO mirrorless camera in this price range has audio out, but watch your recording levels.) No IBIS, or in-body image stabilization (the lenses are stabilized anyway), but I haven't missed it (and lots of videomakers turn IBIS off anyway). The G7 is a really usable and likable camera, shoots pro-quality video, and it's cheap enough you can fit lots of lenses, lights and mics into the budget."^5^Jul 10, 2018 2:36 AM

The camera has nice build quality and feels nice in the hand. The dial buttons are laid out pretty well. I found the kit lens great, but very awkward to use because it is so small. I found the menu system way too over complicated and the amount of options was a little overwhelming. The video quality was great right out of the box. But I bought it for mainly taking pictures. And for a the most part taking them in auto. For me the pictures were a huge disappointment. I did a few comparison shots with my iPhone 7 plus and canon T3.

Every mom wants a great camera to help her capture her family's memories. I went from a basic point and shoot to a DSLR as my family has grown. Now I have moved on to the Panasonic Lumix G7 and I love it! I couldnt believe how lightweight the Lumix is compared to my DSLR. No more lugging around a heavy camera while juggling kids on vacation. The Lumix has a touch screen monitor which makes finding what I need in the menu very easy. The Lumix uses a 4K technology which means it takes a mini video of shots when you take a photo. You can then choose the frames you want out of the video and save as a photo. No more begging kids to stand still for just one second longer while I try to get the perfect shot. They can keep moving and I still great the photos I want. One of my favorite features of the Lumix is the phone app. I can now take an amazing photo on a great camera and then wirelessly send it to my phone to share immediately on social media. No more waiting to get home to download the photos to my computer to then upload them to the internet. If you are a mom looking to upgrade her camera and photography, I highly recommend trying the Panasonic Lumix G7 for a lightweight, high quality option."^5^Jul 20, 2015 1:38 PM

Panasonic Lumix DMC-G7 Mirrorless Micro Four Thirds Digital Camera with 14-42mm Lens is an easy to use camera and lens combo that you can take anywhere. It is extremely lightweight and user-friendly. There is an intelligent auto setting for video and photos so if you want to let the camera do this work, you can without worrying that you'll miss something. If you prefer manual mode, as I do most of the time, all the important settings like ISO, F-Stop, White Balance and Shutter Speed have their own button or dial. This is important, so you don't have to hunt for an important setting to catch the perfect picture.

The 4k is the coolest thing I have ever used! I haven't missed capturing a baby smile since I got this camera. The 4k mode allows you to take 4k video and photos at the same time. All you do is hold down the shutter, and it will keep going. Afterwards, choose the shots you want to save! I've tried to get screen shots of videos on other cameras and it is just blurry and poor quality even with very high-end DSLR cameras.

My next fave feature is the WiFi download ability. I can take photos and immediately transfer them to my phone so I can upload them to social media or just email or text them to my family. It's a huge time saver. This is also pretty simple to accomplish as you don't have to put in any password and just pair your phone and camera. You grab the photos from the Panasonic Image App."^5^Jul 20, 2015 9:47 AM

When I was asked to participate in this program I was a little nervous. I am a iPhone photographer and have never used a proper camera before. When I received the camera it was slightly heavier then I expected, but the weight makes it feel substantial. It feels good to hold and is comfortable in your hands. It is pretty small though, which makes it easy to cart around and not awkward. One of the things I like most about using my phone is that it's always with me. Having the GX85, was an easy transition to make because of its size. 

The touchscreen is also something that makes it easy to navigate through the menus. I liked how the screen flipped up and down, making easy to take at different angles and perspectives. I mainly take street photography and the screen made it easy to use quickly when necessary. The camera is very quiet, almost silent which I really liked because it doesn't draw attention. 

I also found I liked the viewfinder on this camera. It's bright and gives you a clear shot of what you are taking. I also liked how you can see the settings in the viewfinder making them easy to adjust. The pictures are very clear and sharp and the camera has very good capabilities in lowlight, something that my phone is not very good at. 

I also liked the wifi capabilities. At first I had a bit of trouble connecting to the app, but once I got the hang of it it was convenient. 

The battery life on the camera is decent, but I found it went from two bars to no bars very quickly. Also, having to charge the battery with the camera is not very convenient. If you are shooting for a long period of time or traveling I would suggest getting an extra battery. 

For this campaign I focused solely on taking pictures and did not use the 4K video at all. Now that I'm more comfortable with the camera I look forward to seeing what else it can do. 

Overall, I really enjoyed using the GX85, it was easy to use and took very sharp images. I really liked the size of it and it made the transition into using a mirrorless camera effortless. I would recommend this camera to those who want something on the smaller side, but do not want to sacrifice the quality of the images."^5^Jul 29, 2016 10:46 PM

I'll admit when I first saw the Panasonic LUMIX G7 camera, I was intimidated. I am comfortable with my DSLR, but it's so heavy and inconvenient to carry around every day. I have my phone, but I was continually missing great photos of my children because they are constantly in motion.

The Panasonic LUMIX G7 allows me to capture just the right moment with the 4K feature. Don't know what that is? It's awesome! The camera basically takes a video, and allows you to choose which still from the video you want to save. You save it right on the camera with the touchscreen. It's unlike anything I have ever seen before! You can then send the pictures to your phone via wi-fi and an app from Panasonic. From there you can upload them to your phone and share across social media. As a mom, it's great. As a blogger, it's essential. I LOVE this camera!

SouthwestJoe^/nikon-z6-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6292226?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^21^0^"I'm a long-time Nikon user, going back to film camera days. I've eagerly awaited Nikon's first full-frame mirrorless cameras, and the new Z6 exceeds my expectations.

First, this is truly a Nikon. Build quality if outstanding, and the look and feel is 100% Nikon. If you've used a Nikon DSLR, you'l be right at home here. First and foremost, picture quality is just outstanding. Detailed images, with natural colors, especially skin tones. I've always thought Nikon's colors were a standout, and the Z6 continues in this tradition. 

There's tons of options for shooting different effects, and the Z6 expands to include many additional filter effects I've not seen on prior high-end DSLRs (you can find these under the 'Set Picture Control' option, most easily reached by pressing the 'i' button on the back. The touch-screen is a great feature here, it makes navigation from the 'i' button quite natural and easy. I didn't notice any banding or moire effects in various outdoor shots at smaller apertures (shooting both the 24-70 Z lens and a number of my older AF-S lense via the excellent FTZ adapter). Hi-ISO performance is stunning. Even at 12,600, there's amazingly little noise in the Z6 images. In sum, the Z6 produces excellent images in either Raw or out-of-camera JPEGs. 

Highlights with the Z6 controls and usage are the huge, bright no-lag electronic viewfinder. This is a joy to use! Even in very-dark scenes, the viewfinder shows a bright, clear image, almost like night vision for very dark night scenes. There is truly no discernable lag here, either. 

Nikon *finally* added U1-U2-U3 settings to the program dial, a much better system than the 'shooting banks' from prior high-end offerings. This allows you to setup 3 different camera states (I use 'landscape', 'portrait', and 'action') and recall each with a simple turn of the dial. So much easier than the old method.

Many early reviews (especially of the Z7) raised some issues with autofocus, especially in tracking modes of faster-moving subjects. I've just not had issues in this area in a few days of usage of the Z6. The single point modes are great, and cover nearly the entire image area. There's a 'nub' controller on the back, perfectly placed under my right thumb, that allows you to move this point easily over your subject. The Z6 was tack-sharp in nearly every photo using this method, especially with the native 24-70 Z lens. The auto modes worked well, too. It's not quite as quick to pickup less-contrasty subject in AF-C modes compared to my D500, but it's pretty close. There is 3D subject-tracking mode under 'auto'. Press the center OK button, and a white box appears. Move this over your subject (by either re-framing or the nub control), and half-press the shutter. The Z6 will now track this subject throughout the frame. Give a full shutter press when you want to take the shot. The framing box will continue to track the subject, so you can keep taking shots as you like. Work's great. The Z6 uses a combination of shape and color info to recognize the subject, and follows it throughout the frame. To reset the box, you have to hit 'ok' again, and you can start again. Easier to use than describe here, actually.

There's just so much more to say about the Z6. I haven't dived into video modes, but all the other reviews say this is an extremely capable video camera. In-body vibration reduction (called IBIS - in body image stabilization) is another game changer on older lenses that lack this feature. Focus peaking (courtesy of the electronic view finder) means use of older, manual focus lenses is quite easy! Between IBIS and focus peaking, those older Nikon telephotos are starting to look like a real bargain. 

Mirrorless really is a game changer, and Nikon's first full-frame versions are an outstanding advance. So many features here: in-body stabilization, autofocus covering nearly the entire frame, an outstanding, high-res and no-lag viewfinder, tons of picture and shooting options, it all adds up to a highly recommended camera in a great, compact form.

I'm not selling my D810 or D500 just yet, but the Z6 has become my go-to camera for most usage (I'm still shooting wildlife on the D500). Well done, Nikon!"^5^Nov 21, 2018 9:34 AM

I got it for the video capability but I am finding that the still images are much better than what I was able to get from my D750. I have been able to get the exposure right in the camera, which leads to much lower need to edit the photos.

NikonShooter^/nikon-z6-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6292226?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Currently use a D3X for landscape, long exposure, and portraits and a D700 for sports and theater.
I have not had an opportunity to try the Z6 at any sporting events so I cannot comment on fast focusing or tracking fast moving subjects.
I have taken the Z6 camera out to shoot waterfalls and it performs wonderful. One of the main reasons for having an interest in this camera is because of all the focus points; covers almost entire sensor. This makes framing a scene very easy, especially if your focus point is not in center of frame.
The other feature that I was interested in was the Silent shutter; really works in this camera. The Silent shutter combined with the vibration reduction makes shooting slower shutter speeds handheld very easy.
I did not purchase any of the new Z-Series lens. I chose to purchase the FTZ adapter. All of my F-Mount lens work with no drop in performance.
Controls through touch-pad are very handy and easy to navigate.
Even though the camera is much smaller than my D3X or D700 w/grip, the Z6 is very easy to hold.

I ended up buying a Sony RX100 V  which was much easier to put in the pocket and go, but I hated the battery life and lack of mic input. So a year later I sold the RX100 and put it towards the G85 and do not regret it. I recently did a videoshoot using my A6300 as my primary camera and the G85 for B-Roll footage. Should've used the G85 as primary. I love the color science of Panasonic over Sony. Only thing I do not like about this camera is the crappy Autofocus. Everything else about it is amazing. 4k is great (cropped though), battery life is way better than the RX100 and better than the A6300. No over heating in 4k too unlike the Sony cameras.

It certainly did not feel as stout as the Sonys, Olympuses (?) and Fuji cameras in and around the same price point. Although it is weather sealed, I really wondered if it would stand up to my frequent trips to the beach and trails. Also, while the video was fantastic, the pics were so-so.

Suffice to say, it becomes cumbersome carrying a large body camera and lens when trying to capture candid moments at events... or even Burning Man.
I made the switch to Mirrorless before attending Burning Man this year. Partly because I did not want to sacrifice my 'good' camera but I definitely did not want to sacrifice quality shooting.

I cannot express how overwhelmingly impressed I am with the quality of photos I gather with the Olympus. I. Am. Sold.

#1. The fact it shoots in RAW is great for post edit (watch out LR5 users. the format requires a plugin'. 

#2. It's so unbelievably small and light! I was able to carry it on me without any issues. It's the perfect fusion of point and shoot and SLR when it comes to compactness and features.

#3. I'm considering using this over dSLR for all my non-commercial/professional events. I'm shooting at the same level of quality with the Olympus. I've only tried 3 of the Olympus lenses, none of the ones I've used are equal to my 24-70 Nikkor Lens- but who cares when you are just trying to capture the moment without having to lug the big gear!

#4. This price point is BETTER THAN BUYING AN ENTRY LEVEL DSLR! Why spend $500 on an 'entry level' dslr when this will supercede that. I never thought I'd endorse a mirrorless as a starter camera- but you can do some great work with this Olympus. If it can survive 2 weeks in Black Rock Desert --- this is a solid quality camera."^4^Sep 19, 2016 11:34 AM

The Nikon worked, but I wanted more. More definition, better editing (RAW), more clarity, more options. I did my research and kept coming back to the OM-D E-M10 Mk II. I am sure glad I bought it.

Positives: 

Lightweight - I use the same bag for this camera but have added a great 25mm prime lens. I can hike all day with this around my neck ready to shoot and not realize its there.
Fantastic features - the built in Image Stabilization (IS) has paid off in spades already. Shutter say 1/40 no problem, clear as a bell no flash, Less? steady yourself a bit, you're probably okay. 

Drawback:
Menus go on forever - There are some shortcuts, but I am not sure I will ever figure out all the menus. Not a serious issue, since I have have also gotten into post processing, so I shoot everything in RAW and JPEG - which you have to dig into the menus to turn on. But I bet if I mastered the settings my straight JPEGs would be even better, and I could share more without editing.
Not weather sealed - In the pacific Northwest you need to be careful to not destroy your camera in the weather.

Overall -- . A great camera and a good value. The kit lens has a pretty high minimum f stop, and you can find some pretty good 25 mm primes, with a 1.7 f stop for really good narrow depth of field shots and low light shots. But it is very serviceable, I leave it on most of time.

The photos I attached were taken on my first and second hikes with the camera. Its easy to get comfortable with."^5^Aug 18, 2018 6:23 AM

The other reason, I was looking to buy a mirrorless camera and was looking for Sony and Nikon options. I compared them and my priority was good value with the best price and Olympus was on sale and I also got a price match for this. These camera look beautiiful and they do take beautiful shots. I like the art filter features in them and the EVF is convenient (although, if you have the backlight on the EVF turned on, it flickers, which is solvavble). All in all, a good camera for the price and the lenses were on sale, so everything worked out well enough for me."^5^Nov 11, 2016 6:50 AM

I have a T4i which my daughter learned on; she's figuring out the differences (brand, mirror -vs- mirrorless, etc.) so far she's commented on loving the Mark II for the image stabilization, wireless ability, programmable buttons, size & feel, and the retro look.

The Olympus looks very vintage, and has three programmable function buttons on the body which are easy to reach. It also has two dials that can be assigned functions (changing aperture, shutter speed, etc.). The touchscreen is a nice touch, although I do not find myself using it that much. I love how the LCD screen can be re-positioned for low shots. There is a wide variety of shooting modes as well. The stock 14-42mm f/5.6 lens is decent enough to get started.

I will say though that the menu can be a little overwhelming if you are new to photography. If you have some experience, there are a lot of options for customization, and I highly recommend reading through the manual to see just how much you can customize the camera."^5^Feb 27, 2018 5:24 PM

So I did not hesitate to pick this up. 

So far photos look great, but 4K video recording is one of the best in class at this price range.

Some important things to note if you are looking to get this camera:

1) Dual Axis Image Stabilization: The camera body has its own image stabilization and if you attach a Panasonic Lens (the lens will have its own built in image stabilization, too) - the GX85 will use BOTH at the same time = dual stabilization for better photos and video. At the time of this review, you cannot find a DSLR or Mirrorless camera for under $2000 with this feature!

2) New Sensor does not have low pass filter: Some camera brands have low pass filter built into the lens or the camera body's sensor. The purpose of low pass filters works as Anti-Aliasing to by blurring the outlines of the objects to help minimize or eliminating moire - but at the expense of sharpness. Since megapixels are higher in modern cameras, low pass filters are no longer needed and the GX85 has no low pass filter = up to 10% sharper images.

3) It has Direct Wifi connect: You can remote control the GX85 with your smart phone by directly connecting to it (no need for router wifi). You can adjust the camera functions and transfer photos to your smart phone too. Just download and install the Panasonic app to your smart phone.

4) Make sure you have a SD Card that is U3 rated - otherwise you won't be able to use all the camera's features.

5) Micro 4/3 - other Micro 4/3 lens from other brands will work with this camera with no need for an adapter, so you will have a good chose of lens or use lens from your current Micro 4/3 camera if you decide to make the GX85 your main camera.

So far I am happy with this camera and just purchased a Panasonic Lumix 25mm f/1.7 lens to go with it - it takes much sharper images and video than the kit lens."^5^Jun 10, 2016 6:00 PM

The LUMIX GX85 delivers on that requirement. The image quality is excellent with good saturation, and the ability to shoot RAW allows a lot of latitude in post processing. Video quality is excellent also, both in HD and 4K, though 4K video requires a modern processor for smooth playback. The image stabilization seems to work really well. Most rolling movements are compensated very nicely and smoothly. It makes taking videos without a stabilizer pretty easy, but still requires a gently, slow, steady hand for best results. 

Interchangeable lenses promise more creative uses for the camera, but I've not explored that aspect yet. 

There are some drawbacks, especially when compared against the DSLR cameras...

There is a shutter lag, even when the exposure is set to full manual. The short lens doesn't have a manual focus ring, so the camera still performs that function, and it's not as fast as I'd like. Still, off-to-image time is very short. 

The rear view screen is really good in subdued light but almost useless in bright light. Fortunately, the camera has an electronic viewfinder that switches automatically when it detects a face (or stray finger). It provides an adequate quality image for framing, but the optics of the eyepiece create a distorted image to my eye. Part of the internal screen is blurry, and I have to move my eye around to be able to focus on different parts of the screen. I was a bit surprised to find that sort of anomaly in such a high end compact. 

The panorama feature really does a great job. Most images come out looking simply beautiful. But the is one part of the process that I found difficult. If the light levels in the panorama are significantly different, the camera doesn't hold the exposure I asked it to. My examples are subsets where the sun is still slightly above the horizon. The images are stunning, but there is a very noticeable line where the exposure was reset by the camera. That may be a firmware issue and can be fixed in an update. My solution was to play with the starting point and width of the panorama to get one that was a consistent exposure. 

The supplied strap is too short for my style of shooting. I sling the camera under my right arm so it rides on my side or back, limiting the potential for it to swing out when I bend or lean. The strap is too short to simply twist into position as I do with my DSLR, and is a bit tight for letting my elbow slip easily through to bring it to a normal around-the-neck position. I've replaced it with a commercially available strap that ends up being as large as the camera. Adding maybe 6' to 12' to the strap would make a lot of difference (hint hint Panasonic...). Also, a wrist strap would be a handy addition to the packaging. I've installed one in addition to the replacement strap for when it really does get carried in a pocket. 

As a true pocket camera, this one doesn't quite make it because it is still a bit bulky. It won't go into any of my pants pockets like my little Canon, but then none of the true pocket cameras I looked at gave me the image quality or control I was needing. 

Also, the documentation says this camera is not weather sealed in any way, so I'm still looking for a waterproof bag or enclosure that allows me retain control of the camera while letting me shoot in the rain. To date, a gallon zip-lock bag and dry cleaner bags have served as weather gear. 

As a pocket camera, this is a bit large and requires either a strap or a jacket to carry. But as an alternative to carrying a large DSLR for capturing sharp, rich photos, this is a wonderful little camera!"^5^Feb 27, 2017 8:18 AM

Took it out to a fair with my grand kids on the first day i had it and got some great shots without doing anything tricky.

It performs better than any other camera I've ever owned in low light. There are enough features to have you reading the manual and the forums for days. Being a Micro Four Thirds camera, it can accept a huge number of lenses, and the kit lens it comes with is very versatile. You can shoot 4K video handheld in relatively poor conditions and still be amazed by the results. One huge advantage...NO 30 minute limit for videos (provided you have a big enough SD card). Good luck finding that feature on other cameras anywhere near this price point! 
The only real 'cons' are the lack of a hot shoe, no external mic input (who cares, if you're serious about video production you'll have a separate audio recorder anyway) and the fact that you cannot use the camera while charging it. A simple purchase of extra battery/charger fixes that, and anyone using these types of cameras with any serious level of frequency has an external card reader anyway."^5^Jul 17, 2016 2:15 PM

It encourages me to just go out and shoot, which I don't look forward to with a DSLR. It's very discrete, especially using the tilting screen as a waist level viewfinder, so you can get some great candid shots of people, where as people often avoid you or pose if you've got a big DSLR up to your face.

The image quality is very good although not quite up to the standard of a good APS-C or full frame camera, but the differences are not likely to be noticeable unless you are making gallery sized prints or using very high ISO.

Initially I thought the 4K photo modes sounded silly, but they do turn out to be useful in some situations. You only end up with an 8MP image which can be limiting if you need to do some post capture cropping or make very large prints. The GX85 is not the best for capturing sports or other fast motion subjects because the auto focus can't always track a moving subject , but the 4K photo capture mode allows you to get some cool still images at just the right moment of action, assuming the auto focus worked well enough to get a sharp image.

Again, my favorite thing about this camera is the size, but there is a downside to the compact dimensions - there's not a lot of room for your thumb. I found myself occasionally inadvertently hitting the buttons near the thumb grip. There is an after-market thumb grip that might help that situation, but I haven't tried it yet. I'm hoping that I get used to it and learn to keep my thumb in the right spot. The kit lens is decent and very light and compact. If you like to reach out with a telephoto, you'll need to get another lens as the max reach on the kit lens is 32mm (equivalent to 64mm on a full frame).

GeooeG^/canon-eos-rp-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6331672?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^9^0^"First, let me state, I am a photographer, not a videographer. So, I don't use the video features and will not be reviewing those. I have been a long time Canon user. I started with a 630 SLR, then moved to digital with an XT, T2i, 6D and now the RP. The main driver for this purchase was a 2 week trip to Ireland this fall. I wanted to find smaller camera. After doing a bunch of research, it came down to the Canon R or RP. (I am sticking with Canon because I own several 'L' lenses.) I decided on the RP over the R primarily on price. I have been testing the camera for various situations like landscape, street, flowers/macro, etc. and have been very, very happy with the results. Specifically, I am really thrilled with the electronic viewfinder. There are several aspects of the EVF that are a significant improvement: 

(1) the EVF is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get. So when shooting in Manual, you see the effect of changing the F-stop, aperture, ISO as you change it. No more fishing for the depth-of-field button like on the 6D to see what is in focus. 

(2) seeing the light meter and histogram live in the viewfinder ... huge to be able to keep the camera at my eye and be able to assess the light levels when composing a shot.

(3) touch screen to move the focus point and see that in the viewfinder (along with a huge improvement in the AF function thanks to dual pixel). 

(4) ability to review shots in the EVF ... at 57, I need reading glasses to see up close and now I can skip the glasses and just review shots in the EVF in focus!!!

There are a bunch of features I have yet to explore (4K time-lapse, focus bracketing, etc.) I don't find issues with hanging heavier lenses on a light body. I have only used my 24-105 F4 L Mark I with the RF/EF adapter so far and I have not had any issues with balance.

Pros:
EVF
Dual-pixel autofocus
Touchscreen
RF to EF lens adaptor
Controls are well laid out
Built in intervalometer!!!

Cons:
Body is a bit small for big hands, but I plan to purchase the grip extender.
Battery life is quoted at 250 photos, but most reviewers got way more than that. I have yet to run through the charge on the first battery, but I bought a second one anyway.

Overall, I am super happy with the purchase. BB did not have the currently 'free' RF/EF lens adapter in stock, so I had to way a few days to try the camera out. (Shipped to my house for free!) I plan to purchase the RF 35mm macro lens to use as a travel lens when I need a smaller/lighter lens."^5^Apr 25, 2019 8:57 AM
Anonymous^/canon-eos-rp-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6331672?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^9^0^"If you have Canon EF or EFS lenses or just want a small light and very capable mirrorless body this EOS RP is a good choice. This 26 MP sensor (much like the one found in the Canon 6D Mll) is very capable of producing outstanding still images. RAW converters are not yet out so I imagine those files would be even better. I haven't used it with all my lenses but using the Canon adapter my EF 35mm f2 focused fast and accurate. If you starting out the new 35mm f1.8 RF lens would be a better choice.

Not the best body for video, Canon uses a crop of the FF sensor. The flip rear screen is a plus. I only use my cameras for still images so I can't comment on actual results.

With the included Canon adapter I can still use all of my Canon lenses with no loss of functionality. I primarily use the RP body with my Canon EF 50mm f/1.2 USM lens. This is a great combination for travel or just walking around all day, and is especially good for low-light photography.

My only complaint is battery life so I do recommend that if you do purchase the RP, you get an additional battery.

Honestly, the Sony is a much better camera in several different ways (e.g., faster FPS, IBIS, sturdier build).  HOWEVER if you're adapting Canon glass to it you only get the most basic focusing modes.  So, when the price dropped on the RP and included the RF-EF mount, I got it.  It has the usual intentional handicaps out of the box courtesy of Canon (e.g., it won't charge thru the USB-C port with all external batteries, you have NO manual control if you're using the electronic shutter, some weird video oddities, etc), but the big draw is that you can use your Canon EF and EF-S (with diminished pixel count) lenses.  That made the difference for me.  Plus, I've been shooting Canon since my film days and using it was second nature to me."^5^Oct 29, 2019 2:50 AM
Mindcontrol^/canon-eos-rp-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6331672?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Image quality is awesome. The EF/RF lens adapter allows your old Canon lens to work flawlessly. This adapter is better than when I have used the Sigma MC-11 or Metabones adapter on my Sony cameras. My APS-C Canon EF-S lenses also work well. The only issue is it shoots as a 1.6 crop at only 10megapixels. This is still fine for uploading to social media, but for printing 10mp will give you about an 8x10 picture (max) with good resolution. The 1080p video is awesome. The feel of this camera and ease of use is unbeatable. There is really not much to dislike about this camera. My only concern is the RF lens prices are pretty astronomical. I'm not sure if they may a cheaper body only to upsell you on all these lenses. I'll have to save up for all these lenses that I want. For now I got the 35mm 1.8. It is a very good prime lens to pair with this camera. For now I've just been shooting around the house, but I can't wait to see what kind of images it makes when I go out. As always, Canon has some of the best colors around. They are so natural and vibrant. It does not compare to something like a Sony a7iii, but that is around 700 more. For a first FF camera you really cannot go wrong with this."^5^Jan 23, 2020 2:40 PM

FFXBuyer^/canon-eos-rp-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only/6331672?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"This camera fit the bill for everything we needed. Full Frame, light and portable, no need to purchase new lenses, wireless transfer, fast AF, and Canon's color science, which i've always been a fan of. I'm a semi-pro photographer who's used Canons for a long time (mainly the 5d and 7d series along with the first M series cams). I don't shoot sports, and this camera would not be great for that, but i do shoot portraits, landscape, street photography, architecture, etc. and this camera is great for that when you don't want to bring your behemoths with you.

Additionally, i'd like to say that the adapter works flawlessly with my existing lens collection, which is a huge benefit since we all know how much of an investment good glass is. This obviously negates some of the portability of this camera when you're attaching big zooms but with primes or pancakes, this thing is nice and discrete. 

Finally, with firmware v1.4, a lot of the issues this camera initially had are all fixed. AF and tracking are awesome, frame rates for video are better, and a few other fixes. I don't use this camera to shoot a lot of video so, that's not a big issue for me anyway but for those who do, i believe 4k is still cropped. Maybe they can fix that in the future too. 

Overall, a great full frame mirrorless camera that you don't have to spend a fortune on and repurchase all new lenses if you're already on the canon ecosystem."^5^Nov 22, 2019 3:57 PM

Excellent for natural light photography with the right lenses make a great fast focus. Digic 8 gives me a large advantage of a smaller focal point than the previous Digic 6 that I was using.

Nighttime long exposure shots are great as well, and as of early April the Adobe suite started supporting the RP's release of .CR3 raw, so thats great news as well!

Every upgrade gave me something slightly better but overall it was still really about the same camera. Better ISO, more megapixels, and so on, But the way I shot never really changed. I could produce amazing results on either one of the nikons without ever really feeling like the camera was any better. The auto focus, no matter how much hype there was with every upgrade, frankly still felt like I still had to do all the work. Tracking, framing, focus recompose, hold the camera steady/'properly', or get a OS lens, shaky hands? sorry shoot higher shutter speeds. ALL on me as if Auto focus was somehow a required skill for photographers... But this...this is a whole new world. would you ever shoot sports with say...a 85mm prime on nikon or canon? probably not. But on the R3, sony says 'here shoot what you want, how you want, when you want, and hey here's 42 megapixles at 10fps for the blank of it, oh and only $3200' 
WHAT?! To get that kind of performance on nikon or canon you would have to spend $6000 dollars, and you STILL dont get a live image preview, you still dont get a true silent shutter, and you STILL dont get a fully customizable button layout. AND I MEAN FULLY custom. Like i can set individual buttons to focus areas with different shutter, iso , and aperture combos. YEAH. Sony litterally said 'DO WHAT EVER YOU WANT WITH THIS' its insane.

The ability to review your pics before waiting to be recorded on the sim card I feel is huge for me. 
I get split seconds to catch a quality pic so I need to be able to review captures right away. The touch screen is very nice to have. You tap on screen to place focus point on a face, object or the other eye if its on eye detection.

Is Sony's A7R III robust enough? Is it too small? Does the menu system confuse or assist? Is the lens selection first rate? I shouldn't have worried. Not only is the A7R III a jewel of a camera, it's built like a little tank. It's a well thought out design that has been executed as close to perfectly as I can imagine. The landscape and portraiture I've done so far has produced tack-sharp images that stand up to significant cropping without loss of detail. Color balance is spot on in various lighting situations and 'pixel-shift' is an amazing, and unexpected, bonus. The new menu system I worried about learning turned out to be far easier to master than I expected. The layout is straightforward and intuitive and presented a learning curve no steeper than that of any other camera I've used.

With the A7R3, if you get the composition wrong, the ability to crop maintaining incredible detail is amazing to get that just right composition. The eye auto focus is amazingly fast and the 10 fps shooting is incredible. I recommend getting the UHS-II card for this camera. Keep in mind that only one slot is UHS-II and the other UHS-I. It would have been nice to have both at UHS-II. It would have been nice to have the Sony UHS-II reader as a companion to this camera included instead of separate purchase but that has nothing to do with the camera. As far as the camera, the battery life is nearly all day for the hobbyist but I recommend carry of a second battery. With the prior generation, I had to carry 4 batteries. This is a huge plus on great battery life. I like the dual slots. A pro camera to never miss a shot as I have two SD cards in the camera and the 2nd SD Card always serves as a backup to the 1st.

It doesnt shoot 4K at 60fps or 120fps but neither do I. I dont need it. I do have to say that the color science is great for landscapes but isnt up to par with canons skin tones. But with its high dynamic range you can get equivalent color in post. Id definitely recommend this camera."^5^Jan 26, 2018 8:32 AM

If you're looking to squeeze the most out of your camera, prioritizing picture quality, dynamic range, and resolution; this is the best there is. While the A9 has unmatched fps and autofocus, still having the flexibility to shoot at 10 fps in raw at 42mp with 425 autofocus points is insane. Even with all those pixels packed into the full-frame sensor, the ISO performance is amazing. It is packed with a ton of very advanced features such as Pixel-Shift Multi-Shoot Mode, advanced video profiles such as S-Log and HLG, as well as nearly infinite customization of the menus and buttons. Not for the feint of heart but with good lenses and the right training, a powerhouse of a camera for what you're paying."^5^Aug 27, 2019 12:50 AM

Don't get me wrong, the Mark IVs are great still cameras and not too shabby video cameras. However, I do not like not being able to shot in 4K 60FPS. Also, the weight of holding this camera, lens, microphone and a gimbal is getting a bit much for me to 'run and gun' with. I tried the XT-3 yesterday at a wedding and the weight difference was basically like a feather compared to my Mark IV set-up. I haven't edited any footage yet, so I am curious to see how FLOG compares to CLOG, dynamic range, noise, etc. I will say, the battery dies super quick.

The auto focus had been updated drastically and was infinitely more useful for video and stills. When I'm taking stills I can now just worry about framing and have the camera do all of the work of focusing on the face and eye.

Of course you you could always choose to not use it this way. I still find myself using back button focusing since that's just how I'm used to shooting, but it's always a blast to be able to rely on auto focus for those weird angles.

At the time of purchasing, the X-T3 wasn't available in a body only, so I chose the kit. I did use the lens for some time as it was very handy to have a zoom, especially one of that never got too dim at the longer focal lengths.

I was able to purchase this kit during a sales event making it a very attractive purchase.

The size of the camera is a bit larger than Im used to for an APS-C camera but doesnt bother me too much as the accompanying lenses are much smaller than lenses for my full frame camera.  The camera grip is on the shallow end, but there are grip accessories that you can purchase if you need more depth.

The picture quality is great.  The kit lens is more than enough to get you started although I have also purchased used copies of the 23mm f2, 35mm f2, and the 56mm f1.2.  Even at used prices, the cost of Fuji XF lenses are a bit high, so understand that before buying into this system.

SA00^/nikon-z6-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-nikkor-z-24-70mm-lens-black/6292227?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^0^"I actually drove about an hour each way to see this camera in person and try it out (since these are difficult to find in stores). I actually was looking at it as a essentially a sanity check, because I was strongly leaning toward the D750 instead of this camera. 

One of my main concerns about switching to mirrorless was, of course, EVFs vs OVFs. I will say this - the EVF on most modern mirrorless cameras is excellent, but what Nikon has done with the Z series OLED EVF is a step above. In certain very low light situations, an OVF is probably a little bit better, but overall, I now prefer the EVF. The exposure preview is excellent (although this is true on just about any mirrorless).

The main advantage to this camera over other mirrorless cameras is usability and ergonomics. This camera has an excellent user interface and the ergonomics are superb. It feels great to hold.

Not all is perfect about this camera. Many reviewers complained that the camera only has one card slot. This is a valid concern, but it is not insurmountable. For photographers that need redundancy, the camera has WiFi built-in, and can automatically transfer files to a computer over that WiFi connection. It isn't perfect and I certainly would prefer two card slots, but for me at least, it isn't a dealbreaker.

This camera does use XQD instead of SD cards. Some users have complained about the switch because XQD is much more expensive than SD. This is true - XQD cards are expensive. However, I'm very happy with the switch - 14-bit uncompressed RAW files out of this camera get close to 50MB. The data transfer speed of XQD is much, much faster than SD, and this is the kind of camera that needs it.

Nikon says CFExpress support is coming soon in a firmware update, so I would probably buy as few cards as you need (along with a card reader) and wait for the even faster CFExpress. For now though, I'm really impressed with XQD compared to SD - I think it is worth the significant price bump.

Some might like the touchscreen, and I've found it useful in a few instances. However, I've also accidently taken pictures I didn't want to with the touchscreen. I generally find the buttons easier, but the touchscreen is there if I want to use it.

Battery life is not a good as many DSLRs, but that is the nature of mirrorless. A second battery is probably a good idea with this camera (although it was also a good idea with DSLRs).

Technically, the camera handles high ISO very well, but eventually, if ISO is high enough, of course images won't be usable. The included 24-70 f/4.0 S lens is extremely sharp at every aperture. Of course, many photographers will find the f/2.8 version of that lens to be more suitable for their work.

Many reviewers (and even Nikon themselves) have compared the Z6 to the D750, and the Z7 to the D850. I would argue that these comparisons are somewhat inaccurate - the only things that are really similar between the cameras are the resolutions. Essentially, the Z6 is really just a lower resolution Z7 (and fewer autofocus points). Everything else is basically identical (with the Z6 actually being higher performance on a few specs). For example, the Z6 and Z7 both have built-in focus stacking features. On the DSLRs, the D850 has that feature, not the D750. So in some ways, other than resolution, the Z6 is closer to the D850 than the D750.

Overall, this is a great camera. Is it perfect? No. But it was the only camera that 'wowed' me enough to get me to switch to mirrorless. For that, in my opinion, Nikon has a winner."^5^Mar 14, 2019 9:12 AM
Zathras^/nikon-z6-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-nikkor-z-24-70mm-lens-black/6292227?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^17^6^"I'm a professional photographer. Have been since '84. I've used Leica, Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Contax, Hasselblad, Rollei, and even 4x5 Sinars and Linhofs. I have been waiting for mirrorless to be taken seriously by the big two (Nikon and Canon), or was going to go Sony. Now I know which way to go. This is a fantastic camera. The image quality is phenomenal. Video too. The kit lens that came with it, the 24-70 f4 Nikkor S, is amazing. Matched with this camera or the Z7 from Nikon, it's a stunning performer. As good as anything I've used, zoom-wise, and even better than most prime lenses I've used in the past. The camera takes some study and getting used to. It's definitely not point and shoot. But with practice and study, it becomes an extension of you with very easy to use menus. Way better than the competition. And it has much better weather sealing than the Sony mirrorless cameras. It is now my favorite camera. I'm selling everything else."^5^Dec 13, 2018 11:14 AM
v3rlon^/nikon-z6-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-with-nikkor-z-24-70mm-lens-black/6292227?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^8^0^"Nikon took a while to get into the mirrorless full frame camera market, but the result is an unmistakably Nikon Camera. If you are a Nikon lover that has been waiting to make the jump, but see that the future is mirrorless, this is a solid camera.

I came from a D750. I tried a GH5 because of outstanding video and people were talking about how much smaller and lighter M43 was. The truth is, if you MATCH the glass, you do not save much of anything. A D750 with an 85F1.8 compared to the GH5 with a 42.5 F1.2 (35mm equivalent to 85mm with F2.4 DOF) was within one battery of weight, and you needed the extra battery on the GH5.

I went through a Sony A7RII and A7III. One, Sony lenses are expensive and heavy. I also didn't like the menu system. I thought it was far to much trouble to just manually focus when the camera and I disagreed on the subject. Finally there are the options for saving images.

The latest firmware on A7III give us 1. Uncompressed Raw (giant files). 2. Jpegs (except for certain use cases, why spend this kind of money to shoot cell phone images), and 3. Compressed RAW - but it is a LOSSY compression. Why would anyone want that?

The Z6 is a Nikon. It gives a Dynamic range that matches or exceeds the D750. You get a stabilized sensor to help with slow shutter or video. The firmware in May will bring eye tracking AF, but the current subject tracking isn't bad at all. The pictures coming out of the camera look good, even at higher ISO. 

The battery life could be better, but if you don't leave wifi on and work reasonable, a single battery will last a LOT longer that 330 shots. I have been able to go all day on one battery.

Memory card slots. Yes, this camera has only one XQD/CF Express slot ( and yes, they are expensive). They are quite reliable. I didn't have trouble with SD cards as far as it goes, but these are even better. One slot is good enough for Aria, and they are FAR more expensive than this. Your mileage may vary, but it was never an issue for me. I WISH there were two, but I can easily leave with one. 

I also really like the display on top for things you see on the other Nikons. It boots up and take pictures faster than the Sony, especially after a batter swap. The A7III could take a good 15 seconds if the batter was changed. 1.2-1.5 on the Nikon.

The FTZ adaptor gets all the old F mount glass work so you can patiently wait for your favorites, but the 24-70F4 is probably the best kit lens in the history of kit lenses. It is a cut WELL above what you usually see."^5^Mar 29, 2019 8:59 PM

The Z6, along with the Z7, are their first serious mirrorless cameras and they have made a pretty decent entry into the competitive market. This is my first full frame, which may add something extra to my satisfaction with the camera. Low light is no problem, and going to higher ISO ranges with less noise than I am used to has been a really valuable benefit. I find focusing, including low light, is not an issue with the 24-70 kit lens as well as the 50mm. I haven't done any serious action/sports but I believe it will take care of my needs, though I am not a professional by any means. It's just a fun camera to use."^5^Dec 21, 2018 1:40 PM

The feel of the Z 6 is great. It is small but holding it is very comfortable. In comparing with the Sony mirrorless systems, the ergonomics of the Z series is way better, IMO. And, the lens.... I wasn't sure about the 24-70mm @f4. I usually like faster lenses. But, this lens is great. I would still like a bit faster and might upgrade at some point to the 2.8 version but I am in no rush.

I do have a concern about the lack of a HDMI cable in the kit when the manual is clear that one should be in the kit. I contacted Nikon about the cable and they were polite but they stated it was not included but manual shows it is. I believe their is a error with the manual as none of my other Nikons came with that cable. I am overall pleased so far. I believe as they release software updates the features will only improve. Also make sure some lenses do have updates and they may need to be updated to work on the Z6. I hope this info helps."^5^Apr 22, 2019 9:05 PM

I was looking at this and the D750. I read mixed stuff about jumping into Nikons mirrorless line since it was so young, but Im so glad I did. It has so many features! The workability is very similar to the DSLR too, contrary to what I had heard. One of my favorite things that I didnt know about was that it will automatically change modes for the type of sensor your lens is for (FX or DX). I also love that the viewfinder or live view will adjust to your eye as you change settings (e.g., if you increase shutter speed, the image you see get darker to give you a better idea of what your image will look like). It also works very well in low light. I used it on 20,000 iso and it was way better than my D5300 on like 6400.

Negative: It uses an XQD card - theyre expensive. But, it will hold more on smaller GB. I have a 64 and it will hold over 1,000 pics.

Pros
1. More compact than my Canon 5d Markii
2. Video quality is amazing (resolution/auto focus)
3. Wifi capabilities to transfer images straight to web, Ironic because with such a high quality camera all i've done so far is upload images to Facebook and instagram...
4. Quick and quiet shutter
5. In-camera filters
6. exposure compensation easily adjustable
7. zeiss lenses <3

Cons:

1. Battery. Be ready to purchase a couple of these because they drain very fast. Im assuming its because it uses both screens along with lots of other features.

2. I've tried to use the camera without the back screen on but you have to look through the view finder to go through menus which is not easy. Not sure why Sony didn't add a feature where you can just view the menu on the back screen and use the view finder as just a view finder.

3. metabones adapter for canon lenses is disappointing. I understand that communication between 2 different models can cause confusion and is limited, but it shouldn't effect sharpness. Im really disappointed that my 70-200 ii isn't as sharp as it is on the canon. Oh well, just means i need to save for more Sony lenses.

4. While I'm ranting about lenses, Sony doesn't offer a Zeiss Lens that is larger than 70mm

5. Was having difficulty recognizing raw file on photoshop CS6, but works with CC. So that means more purchases in order to edit raws.

Overall, this camera was a great purchase for our family. Seems to be great for what we use it for. This camera delivers on the fact that it is convenient. As all cameras have their strengths and weaknesses I always say go with the one that feel best in your hands."^4^Dec 8, 2015 6:47 PM
SonyCameraGuy^/sony-alpha-a7r-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/9591139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^11^1^"This camera is a significant advance over the SLR and SLT cameras I have owned (film and digital). You will need very good lenses to keep up with the sensor resolution, but Sony has quite a few now (SEL2470Z and SEL90M28G are currently serving me well in that capacity). The multitude of focusing options take a while to master, but are well worth the effort. The high ISO performance is excellent! I routinely use 6400 with stunning results. The A7RII provides an adequate frame rate for stills (5 FPS in Speed-priority Continuous mode), but one cannot expect images of this size to transfer quite as quickly as with other Sony cameras (e.g. 12 FPS for A77). Sony has e-mount specifications freely available and there are mount adapters for almost any lens you can name. Some even allow the functioning of in-lens stabilization with Canon and Nikon lenses. The batteries are small (to match the size of the body) relative to SLR and SLT models so you may need 3 or more for an all-day outing. Be warned of three potential consequences of purchasing the A7RII: 1) you will pixel-peep, 2) you will get a serious case of lens lust, and 3) you will spend a more time with your camera (and have fun doing it)."^5^Jan 6, 2016 5:14 AM

Finding my way around the menus was a bit tough (even tougher if i didn't already have a sony A6K) I felt i LOVED the sony A6000 so much for a starting camera i really stepped it up when i got the A7Rii. it'll take me a few weeks to really learn the camera and its full potential. So all that being said i would recommend this to a serious photographer or someone looking to start a small business in photography. The A6000 is also a great little camera to start out on. But why not go the distance and 'Go Big Or GO HOME' So buy and buy now!

Anything negative is disregarded as being written by some ignorant nobody and then we press on to the next 5 star review. 
When you consider this camera, you are probably looking for something that will satisfy your pixel peeping appetite. If that's the case, it would serve you well to pay close attention to the glass you buy for this camera. Visit DXOmark and check the sharpness rating before you buy any lens. That is, if you care about sharpness. So far I've got the 90mm Macro, the 55mm f1.8 and the 28mm f2. All are at the top of the sharpness heap and show it in the images. Prior to these, I tried the 24-70 f4 and was disappointed with the sharpness in photos. For video it was fine, but you don't need ultra sharp lenses for video since you are only resolving about 8.8 megapixels. 
I'm waiting to see what kind of sharpness values the new G Master lenses get. In the meantime, I'll be saving up.
Is it wrong to want the highest resolution? Maybe, but why use this camera if you are going to settle for less."^5^Apr 25, 2016 9:39 AM

This camera works beautifully with lens adapters for my premium AF Canon lenses and my old incredible AI Nikon lenses (never dreamt I would be able to enjoy these again and frankly didn't know why I bothered to hang onto them)I love it when a plan comes together so exceptionally well!? Hats off to Sony for their engineering brilliance. I recommend the Sony Vertical grip which holds two of the puny batteries and keep two more spares in the bag.

dcisive^/sony-alpha-a7r-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/9591139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"I've been a professional digital photographer since 1999 having owned several Canon pro and half a dozen pro Nikon bodies and their top lenses. Multiple flashes and more along the way. DSLR's still rule regarding fast moving subjects in lower light, BUT this Sony A7RII is the NEW King of the Hill for shear image quality. It has the finest dynamic range, best low noise in higher ISO's and is a pure joy to use ditching the huge and heavy DSLR gear in general. To maximize one's results you are best off going with primes in the 20mm to 90mm range if possible as the resolution on this camera is so tremendous that in order to appreciate and realize it primes are the best lens choice I don't recommend the 24-70 f4 Zeiss as example for it's full of too many compromises. I recommend the 35mm f2.8 Zeiss for walk around and for serious and special results you can NOT beat the 55mm f1.8 being about perhaps their finest overall lens. If you need longer and can swing the price, there is NO question the 70-200G f4 lens is THE lens to own. Sharp wide open from one end to the other and solidly and professionally built. If you need a lens that can do it all don't hesitate to consider the FE 24-240 as it covers it ALL for general use. The HVL-43M is THE best flash for this camera no doubt. The plethora of picture adjustment possibilities are endless. The Jpeg results are by far the finest Sony has ever accomplished. RAW is no longer essential for dramatic results. The Video is industry leading for quality and so easy to use. I was amazed at the quality of the sound just from the built in mics. The screen is plenty large, bright and sharp. The buttons have a quality feel and are NOT mushy by any means. Its a lot of money but this is an ultimate body and deserves great lenses."^5^Jan 29, 2016 9:50 PM

The images are great and there are many options available for tweaking and creating excellent stills and video. The five axis internal stabilization is excellent and works well. However, the menu system takes a lot of getting used to and the manual is sparse particularly regarding settings.

Scott^/sony-alpha-a7r-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/9591139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"I love this camera. It does so much so well. Wifi, special apps that allow for real time HDR, water smoothing, etc. The 42.5MP backlit sensor is giving me beautiful images. I'm able to shoot up to 3200 ISO for events and it looks great. I may try to push it further. E-Mount lens focus functionality is second to none. You can use A-Mount lenses also with an adapter with great results too, though you lose some of the focus functionality available with e-mount lenses, but I've used both with great results. Battery life is not as good with my Sony A700, but with I added a vertical grip so I could put in two batteries. It is acceptable and I can generally get through an event. PLUS this camera does 4K video with excellence. There is nothing about this camera I don't like. That being said, if you shoot stills and have all A-mount lenses, you may wish to wait for the new Alpha 99 mk II coming out in November 2016. The video functionality is not as good, but you don't need to move to e-mount lenses. If you shoot mostly video, you may prefer the Sony A7S mk II. It has a very special sensor for low light video that the A7R does not have, but it's only 12MP for stills. If you want the best of both, the A7R mk II is simply outstanding. I'm very happy with the purchase. Now -- for those of you who do not think of Best Buy as a destination store for cameras, I understand -- BUT -- They were able to get the camera when no one else was, the staff was great, maybe not as knowledgeable as a 'true' camera store, but if you add the Geek Squad protection (at an extra cost) you are set. When I need a camera repair, it's always a minimum of $400. My cameras are in the shop way more than I want them to be (I'm hard on cameras and lenses). The first repair will pay for itself.

It is expensive but I can honestly say that it is priced this high for a reason. When i bought into it I was not happy with the lens selection but it really seems like Sony has listened and came out with the 50mm 1.8 that is affordable as a starter lens. I mainly use this camera for church events that are indoor and sometimes not well lit except on stage. This camera has made it possible for me to take pictures and video with such good quality and visibility in low light giving me more options for angles I never knew could be attained during some of the church services.

That being said, this camera is a FANTASTIC VIDEO camera and a mediocre Photo camera. The S-log footage that was passed on to me in post processing/editing is what made me have to have this camera. It is amazing to be able to edit with. The dynamic range captured with this camera hold up fantastically in post. Add in 120fps and I was in. The bad news is that the auto focusing hunts when it is not in full sunny perfect conditions. The adapter for my Canon lenses is ok, but if you want to shoot seriously with this you better be ready to switch to all Sony Lenses (which are not bad at all). Just don't expect your 3rd party glass to hang with this adapter. I usually manual focus everything anyways since I'm doing mostly video and when I do do photos its usually not with a moving model. I'd say if nailing the photo shot is what you are looking for this is not the camera for you. If you want an AMAZING video camera with internal 4k that is a fraction of the cost and the size of the other 'big boy' cameras that offer this, then this camera is definitely for you."^4^Oct 28, 2015 5:11 PM

There really isn't anything this camera can't do well; however, with adapted lenses and even native lenses this camera will focus good but not perfect with faster objects.

Some will complain the shadows show high levels of posterization, however, if you shoot a black bear inside a coal mine around midnight no lighting your asking for trouble. (Basically don't expect the camera to recover 15 stops of shadow detail and you may want to properly compose the shot next time)

I personally shoot everything from landscape to urban city scape and this camera delivers, I can't say the same for the A7R which was still a fantastic camera but shooting handheld can yield some slightly blurred images if you didn't increase the shutter speed.

Overall with its new stabilized body, 42 Megapixel back illuminated sensor, Improved auto focus and a host of other features this camera will promise to match or exceed the results from say the 5Ds and D810.

Every camera will have an area where it will fall short, however, this camera does a lot of things very well and better composition and planning of the shot will go a long way in achieving the best results."^5^Sep 18, 2015 6:53 PM

Then came the first a7 and since I knew in my heart the future would be mirrorless I was thinking of buying one and trying it out.
However I succumbed to my inner SLR FF snobbery and stayed 100% Canon. Then comes a7II, a7s, a7r. I really liked the idea of not being strapped down to one lens mount. I mean with M mount adapters, Metabones etc I was seeing the benefits already.
Then last year the a7rII comes out and I try one out. I used my Canon 50mm 1.2 L with a metabones adapter and it focused faster than it could on a 5d mkIII and no back focus or hunting.
Wow, focusing peaking, quick, easy to know you got focus pegged when the subjects eyes light up.

Did a ton of research on what would fit my needs. Didn't think I would end up with a mirrorless system and have no regrets. My main requirements were: 

1. weight
2. great image quality (especially during low-light scenarios) 
3. great lens family (something I had not done in the past, but knew I was going to do going forward). 

PRO
I've been shooting in various location and lighting scenarios over the last month and LOVE the image quality. Night shots are beautiful too! ISO range allows me to capture small details with no/little graininess. My entry-level camera night shots always left me wanting more clarity. I can't look at night shots taken on my mobile phones anymore. Why did I ever bother? Haven't done much with video yet so can't speak to that....yet.

CONS
Batteries don't last long. Two full batteries lasted a half-day excursion at a forest in Fire Island. Just ordered more for days I know will last longer, but for $50 a pop, this adds to the overall price of the system. This does keep the camera weight down though. A tradeoff for wanting a lighter camera.

price? This is some pricey equipment. Something cheaper might be good for what I currently do, but this is also something I want to grow with as I step up my photography game."^5^Aug 11, 2017 7:50 PM

BUT the huge caveat is that it is not at all USER FRIENDLY. Not even a little bit. The settings menu and all the buttons all over the camera are not intuitive whatsoever. Ive worked with Canon and Nikon DSLR's and they are 10x more intuitive even if you haven't read the user manual.

So to get great pics from this camera you really need to STUDY UP on all its features, functions, etc. Even after a year, I have to sit there and try to read up on how to do simple things on my camera. For instance, I forget how to format my memory card because the menu is so not intuitive that I have to literally scroll through almost 50 menu windows to try and find it. In the end, I have to just google it and read up which sub-menu it is located in!

Also, after a year, both batteries that it came with are dead! I will charge them to full, and leave them out of the camera so that they are ready to go the following weekend. Then I go to shoot the camera, I pop in the battery and the thing is down to 9%!!! This started slowly happening over time and I really should have called Sony about this months ago but never got the chance.

stekar^/sony-alpha-a7r-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/9591139?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Was debating between this and the newer 7r3 model. At the end, factoring-in the huge discount and features set, I've opted for the 7r2 body. Coming from the original A7, i had battery, 35 f/2.8 and 85 f/1.8 lenses. 
The silent shooting in Af-S is extremely useful, and so is the face tracking.
I just shot a basketball game with the a7r2 in 18MB, and was very pleased with the results. But if you plan to shoot a lot of sports at full resolution, go for the a7r3 or save up for the A9 (no EVF blackout). If you want to shoot landscapes on a tripod leveraging the a7r3's pixel-shift I wont recommend the a7r2.
If your main objective is video, then look at the A7s2, but the A7r2 is not too far behind.
All in all, the Sony A7r2 is an amazing camera, for stills and video. Lightroom processes RAW very well too.
I'd also like to give a quick shoot-out to the BestBuy staff. Very professional, super patient with my numerous trips to the store in testing-out numerous lenses and focus conditions. Not to mention they were very knowledgeable. Kudos!"^4^Feb 11, 2018 12:45 PM

This camera produces the sharpest images available, IMHO. I started years ago with a Sony A6000. When I started shooting commercially, I switched to what I thought would be a better camera, the D7500. It wasn't long until I made the switch back to Sony. In addition to superior image quality, the user interfacing is so much smarter and more practical than the Nikon. I also purchased the 24-240 mm zoom lens which has been great... but when the A7rii is combined with the fixed lens, f1.8 50mm, there are no crisper images known to man... or at least to me.

This Sony offers superior dynamic range compared to Canon, its smaller, has internal stabilization so you don't need IS lenses, can focus on subjects eye, and a ton of other features. The main draw back for me is that I can not shoot fast with the Sony. You would need the Sony a9 for that. I sitll love my Canon 1Dx but haven't found myself shoot with the Canons since going with Sony. With the mirrorless Sony you will have a lot more options with lenses if your get a lens conversion kit which are also not costly.If you are looking to buy Sony I would recommend now the a9 unless you want the larger MB files and dynamic range of this camera, the a7rii, just remember the ar7ii can't shoot fast and will buffer on you."^5^Sep 10, 2017 10:45 AM

This two year old Sony former flagship still outshines the new flagship, a9, in certain departments that are critical to some of us. Namely, that 42mp sensor. The AF is still going to work just fine for us landscape and portrait photographers. Two memory card slots would have been nice, but I've only heard stories of memory card failures third hand. It's never happened to me or anyone I know. I know it happens though and it seems Sony is addressing this in their new cameras to come. I know a lot of people are interested in the latest and greatest. The a9 is an awesome camera. If you're a sports or wildlife photographer, maybe even an event photographer, you can probably justify that extra cost. For most of the rest of us we would probably be better served putting that extra 2k towards a piece of G Master glass."^5^Aug 29, 2017 9:01 PM

The biggest difference I have discovered about the RII is the autofocus functionality. It is far superior to the other 2 bodies but as for picture quality, I really don't see that big of a difference between the 7II and the RII. The SII differs in picture quality, even when all three have identical settings. The photos from the SII are brighter than the other 2 bodies and even at identical ISO settings, the pics from the RII are not all that distinguishable so It would seem that if autofocus speed is not a neccesity, save your money and buy the A7II."^5^Jul 8, 2017 10:09 AM

There's all kinds of good stuff to help it excel in that department such as in-body stabilization and quality lenses with large apertures. The autofocus works great. I mainly AF-Continuous with Eye AF and AF-Continuous Lock-on which locks onto a subject and it will continuously track that subject.


One last PRO I want to mention is the very aggressive marketing/R&D by Sony and Zeiss. Zeiss lenses are amazing and they are one of the world leaders in what they do.

I have both the a7sII and the a7rII and both are amazing cameras. I am a videographer who does occasional still photography and I would chose the R over the S mainly because I shoot in some light and the autofocusing is better on the R versus the S.

The low light is better on the S model but the R holds its own. If you don't plan on shooting on pitch darkness, the R might be a better choice due to the ability to hold focus better (in daylight). I must also ad that the low light is comparable when the R is in APSC mode. The full frame mode in low light is abysmal. With that being said, I use canon glass (both FF and APSC) and they work great with this camera. I am also using a Metabones IV Canon to Sony E-mount and the autofocusing is almost native.

I would highly recommend the Sony a7rII for both stills and video. Though, if you plan on shooting in extreme low light conditions, go with the S. If you have some light, the R is a better all around camera."^5^Jan 30, 2016 1:50 AM

There are tons of reviews about this camera online so you can go take a look at them and I won't repeat it all but to sum it up it works amazingly well. I had a Canon 5D Mark III before and there are many ways in which this doesn't compare but where it counts, the A7R II hits the mark very well. Relative to that full-frame DSLR this thing has the following pros:

- amazing electronic viewfinder that works very well
- compact package
- image quality is superb
- so much detail

These are the negatives:
- high ISO is decent but not great (5DIII was better for me)
- AF is good for people, candids, outdoor/landscape photog etc but not great once the lights get low or when your subject is moving quickly
- lens selection could be better but with the amazing 35mm collection and 85mm Batis I am mostly covered for now
- menus are just not as good

I considered going back to the 5D III, considered the higher 6D, considered the 5Ds/R and just couldn't find an overall package that was going to be better than this once the right lens (Zeiss Batis) was released and the A7R II was released. Go read some reviews and see for yourself. If you have the money you won't be disappointed."^4^Aug 19, 2015 10:50 AM

I am not a full time professional as I have a great job and this is more of a hobby that I have taken to the extreme. That is really important here because this camera is amazing in every way possible EXCEPT for sports shooting. The focus system is extremely complicated but one you figure it out it is AMAZING! Ok now for the down, this doesn't affect me because I mostly shoot portraits but this would make me very nervous at a wedding or paid event. If you shoot high speed continuos first of all its only good for about 10 shots before it slows down and shortly after stops. The camera has froze on me twice doing this so bad that I had to wait a long time and then take the battery out to get it reset. I love the size, I love that I can see what is being exposed prior to shooting very accurately and the quality of photos even at ISO 6400 and above are unbelievable. I will note I am only shooting with Carl Zeiss lenses but none the less. If you are looking for a light way low light beast and you are not shooting events or weddings for a living this is your camera. Amazing! I hope Sony will fix the bugs as this was a LARGE investment to have these types of freezes happen. Overall I still rate it five stars because the results don't lie and this has improved my results far beyond what I even imagined when prior purchase."^5^Feb 21, 2016 6:44 PM

Sony has quickly produced quality FE lenses which make full use of the sensor, and will continue to do so. And A-mount users rejoice, don't sell your wares, with the LAEA3 adapter they work great. Canon/Nikon/Leica etc, adapter technology is quickly catching up, so fear not. Loses one star because adapted lenses do not work as fast or well as as native FE-mount lenses.

I moved over to full frame from my previous Sony a55. This thing is solid, feels very good in your hands with the added dimension in the grip. It is light enough when compared to other larger DSLRS so carrying it is a joy. At the moment I am using the LAEA 4 with 2 minolta lenses, Sigma 85 1.4, and my Tamron 28-75 2.8 a mount lenses. I am planning on grabbing the 55 1.8, Macro 90mm, and Batis lenses soon but in the meantime I am enjoying every minute of this amazing camera. Note, for those of you who own A mount lenses make sure you research which lenses auto focus with the LAEA3 because most of mine did not work with that adapter. The LAEA4 works with all the older lenses that do not have a built in drive but you do lose the 399 focus points and several auto focus modes. However, I found that the LAEA4 focuses well with my lenses and the 1/2 stop I lose is no problem with this camera.

It fit on the camera but left a black border around all pictures because it was not the one for the specific camera."^4^Jan 4, 2019 4:04 PM

I tried point and shoot cameras but they just didn't take the quality of photos that I was looking for. This camera is almost as good as my Canon 5DM3 but not quite as good in low light but it's a trade off I'm willing to make when I am traveling. The smaller size makes up for it. I bought the 55mm Sony lens and have been very happy with the clarity I get with this combination of camera and lens. In normal shooting instances it's on par with my Canon 5DM3 and the Canon 50mm L series lens. I guess if I had to complain about anything it would be the lack of Sony prime lenses that are available for the Sony a7ii. I do understand that there are new lenses being released this year which should help. I have used some of my Canon lenses with this camera using an adapter. The results aren't as good as I had hoped. Autofocus isn't available on all of them and when it does work, it's slow so I usually end up manually focusing. Overall I'm very happy with the image quality and portability of this camera and would definitely recommend it to others looking for a full frame, lightweight travel alternative to a large DSLR."^5^Apr 3, 2015 7:02 PM

I was referred to 1-888-237-8289  they put me in contact with the local Corona Geek Squad  their response was as expected,  They could do NOTHING and that 'Precision Camera' has the final word on an exchange and/or replacement'

Another waste of my time in an attempt to get this issue resolved/addressed.

Ive had my Sony A7II in for service 3 time, the camera intermittently fails to focus properly ... and each time your service provider Precision Camera only response is that they Cleaned, Calibrated and checked the Software Release. When I take the camera out and shoot a couple thousand PICs I find that the camera continues to intermittently not focus properly. I shoot with both manual and auto focus lenses. I take multiple HDR, Focus Stacking and Panoramic PICs. If one of the numerous PICs I take are out-of-focus the merging, stacking and/or stitching of photos fail to provide the expected results.

I shoot a Sony RX100V, Sony A7II (in for repair 3 times) and a Nikon D850. I am retired and have been an avid photographer for 15 years. I know when a camera is not performing as expected/advertised etc.

My local Geek Squad state that Precision Camera has the last word and an exchange or replacement is out of their hands.

I dont like spending $300 for a 3 Year Warranty or $300Warranty/$1700Camera=18% of the Purchase Price and finding that the Warranty is not worth the paper it is written on.

I plan on taking a 9 month trip this summer, starting April 1st, to Canada and Alaska  I need a camera I can depend on.

Your assistance in resolving this issue is appreciated.

And couldn't be happier. The camera is faster focusing and cleaner RAW and jpg files than I've ever seen out of a digital camera. And the reduced size, weight, and price tag are a joy to both my shoulders and my wallet. Features like built in wi-fi and OLED viewfinders to be able to preview my images before I shoot is amazing and makes for a higher number of useable shots. I'm also thrilled to have Zeiss lenses back in my camera bag and in front of a digital sensor, after all these years. (my first pro cameras were film Hasselblad's and Contax's that I still use one in awhile) Three cheers to Sony for creating such a great and innovative camera system that has energised this third generation pro photographer."^5^Apr 19, 2015 12:44 AM

I was looking for a smaller camera for when I didn't want to lug around a DSLR. I wanted a Mirrorless camera so I did my research and opted for the Sony a6000. I was so impressed with that camera that I upgraded to the Sony A7ii. This camera is incredible. For those non photographers out there you can just put this baby in auto and just let it do its thing. For those of you that understand photography, Thanks to the 5 axis stabilization you can handhold this camera at 1/5th of a sec and not have any issues. Sharp!!! It's simply magical. I've only purchased one Sony lens. The 28mm f2. Love that combination!! I also invested in the Photodiox canon to e-mount adapter so I can use all my canon lenses. The autofocus is considerable slow so sports is def out of the question. But at least I don't have purchase a whole new Arsenal of glass. If you're on the fence about this camera trust me you'll have no regrets. Sony is stepping up the game."^5^Mar 11, 2016 6:38 PM
iso500^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-body-only-black/1633004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^4^"As a professional photographer, who has recently switched from traditional DSLR camera bodies, to the new wave of mirrorless cameras, this new Sony a7ii model, is packed with pro functionality, without the price tag! At just under $2k, this camera blows away everything in it's price point and up to around $5k. The body is rock solid. (I actually dropped it the first day I purchased it, from about 3feet in the air, and it bounced around 3 times on parking lot pavement, and I only ended up the a scratched lens hood?). The weather sealing is excellent, all around. The dials and function buttons are laid out in a very usable way, and can be customized to fit a very simple or complex workflow. The viewfinder is very sharp, with great color. The LCD back panel has a 'retina' display look about it. I coupled it with a Zeiss 24-70mm f4, and the image quality is superb, with robust color, contrast, and sharpness. It's like having the rich tonality of a Canon 5d, with the sharpness and dynamic range of a Nikon full frame. The 5axis sensor stabilization, and the ability to retro-fit Canon and Nikon glass, are 2 amazing features that put this camera body in a class of it's own. Sony is paving the way for future mirrorless technology!! I would recommend this to a beginner because, the improved workflow through the camera's functionality allows a new photographer to concentrate more on composition and lighting, and not have to worry about frustrating things like making sure that your subject is in focus, due to it's face detection technology. Novice photogs will also benefit from AUTO mode, due to the factory programming preference, that prioritizes a fast shutter speed, so that good focus and exposure are achieved, with little to no thought process from the camera operator. But, I also recommend this camera to experienced and professional photographers, due to the light weight, smaller footer print, and the customization of menus and buttons for providing a very intuitive and efficient workflow(focus magnification, focus peaking, face detection, face registration, Direct Manual Focus, back button focus, etc.) This is truly the most under rated camera by far, due to the fact that it is so ingenious, that most people are clueless to it's true potential."^5^Dec 13, 2015 11:23 PM
DanMiz^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-body-only-black/1633004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"So I recently decided to step-up my photography. After doing much research on various blogs, web-searches, youtube videos I landed on the Sony A7ii as my ideal camera. It's smallish footprint and full-frame capability seemed as if it would be everything I am looking for. I was using a Canon T3i for about 2 years. That series of cameras is a perfect line for the beginner, entry-level user. I learned a lot using the crop sensor and lenses.

But now its on to the big time! The Sony A7ii is amazing. I noticed the difference as soon as I heard the first shutter click. It's fast, a little loud, lightweight and takes amazing pictures. I'm still in 'learning mode' with all of the various features the Sony A7ii has to offer. But after 3 weekends of shooting, I know that I made the right choice. I can't wait to get out and capture my daughter's life and the world around her."^5^Jun 16, 2015 10:10 AM
Bronxite^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-body-only-black/1633004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^2^"This is my first major investment into one of my hobbies, and the most expensive one, photography. Was going to go DSLR with my first major investment but went Mirror-less... I don't have previous experience with anything that's not a cyber-shot camera or an iPhone - so my opinion on this product is that from someone who's never used a professional camera. To start, I was worried, but this mirror-less camera meets and probably exceeds the quality and features provided by its DSLR counterparts AT A MUCH LOWER COST. Its because of the savings that I was not too worried. I wanted my first purchase to be an introductory level item (a good one) before I purchase one of the toys for 'big boys'. I bought the Sony A7 II (body) and I also got the Sony 18-105 mm G F4 lens last week during Black Friday (no discount though :( - grrr) ...and Since that Black Friday, I've been playing with this camera any chance that I get... my 5-year-old hates me right now. I don't know where to start... first, this camera allows me to take professional grade pictures. I believe I can take my son to the park, take pictures, and then get away with telling my friends I paid a professional photographer $1000 for that photo session - and they will believe me. Even though its much lighter than the DSLRs Ive handled during my research it still feels solid. There is balance between its construction and design - like its ergonomically designed to be held in a photographer's camera handling posture - I really don't know how to say it but there is some sort of natural feel to it while Im taking pictures - not too heavy - not to light... just right. The functions, the buttons they WERE just too overwhelming for me. Again, I'm new, I just look for the flower icon to take close-up pictures. But Im sure those who are at this level know how to properly use this buttons and functions. Fast forward a few days, I have read the manual, done some google-ling, done some tutorials and just want to say that after you read the manual. the buttons and functions are not that intimidating at all. in fact, I found it easy to learn. The learning curve is not too steep for a novice. Listen, there are two ways to use this camera, one takes excellent pictures - the other takes even better pictures... You can take this baby out the box and just put it on auto and call it a day because you will be taking very good pictures. But I just don't want to be an auto-focus guy... I want to take it to the next level and learn/apply every feature available in this camera. I want to be able to push it and basically use it to the extent it was designed for. Right now, Im just up to the level where I am conscious that you must properly set the ISO /F stop / shutter speed for your shots. I just need to remember which settings best apply to the picture I want to take. I believe that will come with practice. Like I said, I don't want to be the auto-focus guy but it will be impractical to manually set your camera for every shot... but the gist is... I want to be able to know how to do it manually - when I feel it needs to be done manually. This camera gives me this opportunity. it has exceeded my minimal expectation of quality and ease of use, the pictures are sharp, the colors are crisp, pictures at 10-12 megapixel are already professional grade - you get 24.3 megapixel, unless you are printing banners and posters to hang on the side of buildings you really don't need anything higher. If anything, else - you can't go wrong with the Sony brand. 

Other Features: 
By the way, Im not too much into recording movies but I did record my son and niece acting silly and I also recorded a drive around the neighborhood. To be honest, it looked like a movie - all I needed was lighting/filters and mics and it would've looked official. Videos are recorded in HD.

Has an image stabilization feature which I believe is working as intended because my stills are blur-less - you can still pay $500 of a gimbal - but you are at that level you probably need a higher end camera - unless you want to get it just to get it. but you can also use a tripod and a shutter remote which is probably the cheapest alternative if the image stabilization feature is not enough for you.

It is Wi-Fi capable - Im not too happy with how this was implemented (or maybe Im just using it wrong) I expected the camera to show up as another node on my network. One where I can double click and open folders and copy pictures over. I'm finding you cannot do this. The way it works is that you need to download an app from Sony so you can import photos using a wireless connection. TOOOOOO SLOOOOW (again I might be doing it wrong but that transfer rate is too slow) Currently, Im connecting it via USB to my pc to transfer pics from camera to computer. I placed an order for an NFC reader where, theoretically, I should be able to just lay the camera on top of it and it will transfer the pictures to my pc - wirelessly via the NFC connection.

Battery: Ive read lots of bad reviews - but I had to try for myself before I jump on the band wagon. The battery does get drained fast which is why I dont understand why this product doesn't come with an external power adapter. The Sony brand costs about $90, the cost of a good substitute is about $30-40. Being the battery life is so poor you figured they would throw that in there just to distract you from the fact that your batteries can potentially drain in 1-2 hours of heavy use. What Im not going to do is chastise the quality of this camera because of the poor battery life. It is an electronic device - more bells, more whistles = more power needed. By the way, I did order two spare batteries with charger and an external power adapter (not the Sony brand because Im already over my budget on this toy... and i'm still spending over budget). Until I found a 6 ft. long micro USB cable, I had to use the very short micro USB cable, which came in the box, to charge my battery. I have to connect it to the camera just to charge my batteries - which make me uncomfortable because someone can knock it down and basically this camera is a $1500 camera not a $1500 battery charger. The camera needs to be packed up in its, very protective carrying case, far away from the potential harm of curious friends and family members who want to touch the nice new stuff you just bought, while the battery is charging via a normal battery charger (cant wait until it gets here). Anyway, that's my recommendation - get an external power adapter and at least 2 extra batteries with charger so that you and your camera can get a good nights sleep. 

TL; DR
I'm am extremely happy with this camera. It definitely fits my needs, my level of expertise and usages - about 99% pictures and maybe 1% videos (as of now). After 3 days of playing with it... I was sold so I went and purchased the Sony - HVL-F45RM External Flash (2 of them) - Which I recommend you buy 1 if any for your camera. It will also serve as a controller for wireless external flashes if you ever want to buy more. The wireless controller costs a bit less than this external flash but for a few bucks more might as well get the F45RM. My next major purchase will be the Sony - G Master FE 85 mm F1.4 Lens ($1800 at time of this post) ... probably sometime next year (I cant wait) unless there is some major price drop soon or Best Buy offers some 1/2 price promotion - other than that it's a waiting game."^5^Dec 1, 2017 9:07 PM

The a6000 and a6300 take great pictures in Auto Modes and all modes and especially paired with some extra (separate purchase) high quality lenses (Glass).

Karn^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-body-only-black/1633004?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"I already have an A7S (purchased used at a third of the retail cost), an amazing camera that really does see in near dark. I also shoot Nikon (crop sensor), which I use for wildlife. I've wanted a full frame camera for a long time, and picked this one up in an open box sale. It's not the latest tech (I think it's going on 3yo) camera, but it still seems to keep up at the very least with other 24 MP in its price range. I love the Sony cameras - I find they are a pleasure to shoot, and the in-body stabilization of the series 2 is a real bonus. I use legacy lenses on both my sonys, I also own two sony lenses. Legacy lenses are best used in manual mode without spending the $$ on an adapter. A $20 adapter will allow you to use cheap but very high quality legacy glass. Just amazing quality, and addictive. If you want faster autofocus though, and all that sony offers in a system, sony glass is the way to go. I have the basic 1.8 50 mm lens (slowish, not horrible optics), and the 24-70 4.0 Sony ziess (bought used for a good price). There is the drawback - sony lenses seem to be a bit pricier than their Nikon and Canon counterparts, but you can find them discounted if you keep looking. The 7ii has pretty good video capabilities including formats and settings that produce high quality and deep dynamic range in 1080p (no 4K). The shutter is loud in this camera, but doesn't seem much louder than my nikon. You can't shoot in silent mode like you can with the a7s or a7r series. I really enjoy the EVF and ability to use focus peaking with non-sony lenses. The viewfinder screen, which allows to to view at limited angles is good enough, but not as advanced as other cameras. I used to own a samsung nx300, which had a superior touch screen (it was ahead of its time). I'm still learning the camera, but pleased so far - and it really is a great FF for the money. Would I prefer the A7rii? Yes. But even at discount they are about $1600 more than what I paid for this camera. I'll live with what I have for now and spend money on lenses. One big issue I have with the second series sony cameras though, which is why I dropped one star: the firmware (currently 4.0) is a 'star eater' - look it up. One of my passions is night photography - the A7s is great for that, and still out performs the newer A7ii and possibly the A7rii. It also has the older firmware, which does not eat stars - and is so much better for astrophotography. On that topic: while the A7s is known for low noise at higher ISO, the A7ii is no slouch. Another complaint people have is that RAW is still minimally processed with the sony cameras. I'm still trying to find out what that means for me. But there are a lot of people who use sony professionally, and find a way to create amazing images."^4^Sep 2, 2017 9:25 AM

Its compact, powerful, and user friendly. Personally, as mainly a Sony shooter, I usually have issues with switching to a canon body but the M6 ii is really intuitive and easy to use with minimum practice and I was able to shoot what I wanted to pretty efficiently right out of the box. Since this review will be long without all the spec talk, Im going to keep most of that out mostly because you can easily read the specs anywhere with a quick search. Ill try to keep it mostly to how those specs are used and/or features that arent listed in most descriptions as well as what it is like to use in general. 
Like any product, theres going to be some pros and cons and some of those are going to be user opinion and not always a fault to the device. I went with 5 stars because most of the cons I found with this camera were based on user preference and not a fault of the camera itself. So with that, lets get into it.

PROS: 
 4K video. Right? Thats always a pro. Well, it was almost a con because there was no 24p option at 4k but canon has said it is coming in an update shortly and by the time you read this its probably available. So thats great, and really, for the average video shooter, vlogger, vacation memory maker etc, 4k at 30 is going to be just fine and youll probably not even notice. That said, the 24p update coming soon is a nice nod from canon to show they do still care about us video production guys and girls and are willing to make that an offer even on their lower end tier bodies. There is also great options at 1080 resolutions for slow motion and time-lapse options. For your basic YouTube content maker or hobby video shooter, this camera is a good budget friendly option. 

Stills: I think there may be some slightly better options (depending on your preferences) for compact video shooting bodies in this class but for still photography, this body really shines! There is a lack of lenses currently (more on that in the cons) but there are ways around that with adapters etc and honestly, the kit lens this comes with (at 15mm-45mm) is a decent lens for images for web or for vacation shots and capturing moments at home. And since it is interchangeable lenses, you can buy more lenses to fill any need. The rumors I keep seeing is that sigma will be coming out with some really nice primes for this mounting system (EF-M) soon which will only up the value of this awesome camera.
 The auto focus is great. With Canons dual pixel auto-focus, you get fast, sharp auto-focus in any shooting mode and theres even a touch and drag focus option when using the EVF which allows you to touch the LCD and drag your focus wherever you need it in video or still mode. 
 The image quality when in good lighting conditions is really good. You can get sharp clean shots, especially with the fast shutter speeds available and in low light theres an on-board flash that can pop up and help you out. The sensor seems to be really high quality from my testing and it even does a quick cleaning of the sensor every time you turn it off which is nice that you dont have to remember to do that every couple uses. At high ISO you are going to get some noise, but you can clean that up easily in post. 
 EVF. Electronic ViewFinder. This is going to show up in my cons list as well personally, but its not that its bad, it actually works great and is a wonderful quality, but personal opinion is that they should have simply built it into the body. Ill touch on that later. But the pros of the EVF, besides the aforementioned touch and drag focus, are still worth mentioning. The EVF works really well especially in bright sunny conditions or when you need to really look closely at the image. It slides onto the hotshoe very quickly and easily and has a small release button to remove it. Personally I am 99% shooting with an EVF, I find them easier to frame shots with, less distracting light or visuals I would have in my peripherals when looking at an LCD screen and it helps me keep the camera steady when I shoot. That being said, if youre going to be vlogging mostly or you are shooting video, the EVF is not a big deal and perhaps being able to remove it would be beneficial to you. Keep in mind if youre going to flip the screen up for selfie style video or photos, the EVF will completely block your view of the screen and will have to be removed. This seems like a missed design flaw in my opinion and one of a few reasons a flip OUT (to the side) vs flip UP screen should have been used. But hey, If the EVF isnt something you use, you can remove it. However if you think you will ever use it I would suggest getting the bundle with the EVF included. Besides getting a decent lens, youll have the EVF and save spending 200 later for it. (lets be honest, thats a bit overpriced for something that is generally included in any interchangeable lens camera.)

One quick note on the kit lens, I really like that it is compact. I dont know the technical term for it, but the lens has a switch that allows you to close down the lens when not in use. This makes the lens smaller in your bag/pocket/etc and really nice feature to have for a system that is built around being small and compact. 
 
I want to touch on connectivity options lastly here in the Pros section. This is something that works a lot better on the canon than on my Sony bodies and extremely useful especially for shooters who need to do a quick turn around on the go. There are WiFi and Bluetooth connection options. Thats not unheard of but the part I want to focus on is how it works even when the camera is off (after switching a few options in the menu). This means my camera can be tucked away, in the bag and turned off and in the back of my car and I can be sitting in the passenger seat with my phone and connect to the camera and view and download the images to my phone! This is really useful. You can download an image, edit via your favorite mobile app editor and post to wherever, all with the camera sitting off in your bag. You can also obviously do this with the camera on and use your phone (with the free canon app on android and iOS) as a remote and see a live view version on your phone screen, adjust settings and shoot all from the phone remotely. Theres a variety of connection options available like printers, remotes, phones, computers etc and they all worked very easily without having to look up how to do it. 

CONS: 
Ok, so lets touch quickly on a few cons Ive come across that, like I said earlier, are not faults of the camera as much as things I dont personally like based on my shooting style and needs. 
 EVF: I explained what the EVF is and how it works and why its awesome already. So for the parts I dont like so much, top of the list is that it's bulky. Because it is removable and all in one it actually makes the camera overall size large and awkward when it is attached. Other bodies in its class have them built in and manage to take up less space. The obvious flip side of this is without the EVF on, the M6 Mark ii is now smaller than most of those competitors. This makes it compact and pocket size and definitely a great option when you have to pack light but dont want to lose quality. Lastly, with the EVF on, you lose your hotshoe. This means youll be choosing between mic or EVF or if you use a speed-lite or EVF. Probably not an issue for most, but keep it in mind.
 Lens selection: So this isnt much of a fair con especially since any new style body from any manufacturer is going to take some time to get a nice pile of lenses available, but the mount system (EF-M) currently is a small group. Of course, grab an adapter and you can use your other canon glass, but that shouldnt be a must and personally I like to shoot with the native mount whenever possible. The thing I dont love about the EF-M mount is it cant be used anywhere else. I can take a sony EF mount and put it on a sony E mount (crop sensor) and they still work, just cropped obviously. So it would be nice if these mounts were more universal but the compact size of the lenses is a major plus. 
 Where my picture profiles at?: As a video shooter, I am disappointed that there are no pro level picture profiles like CLog which is not a must for a camera in this class, but you cant ignore that other brands do include more pro level profiles and in general just have more pro video options. There is still a mic input and USB C but micro HDMI instead of mini HDMI is a head scratcher. 
 Battery and SD card slots are on the bottom but they can be blocked by a tripod quick release if you have one on. 

Thats probably plenty for now and too much info for most. Suffice it to say you wont be disappointed with this Mirrorless option from Canon with so many amazing features and options for the basic beginner shooter to the pro shooter who needs a nice reliable B cam or an on the go compact body. The menus are easy, the button layout is great, you can change lenses and remove the EVF and so much more. This is a great body for any canon shooter and even if you shoot with other brands, youll still love to shoot with this body and enjoy all it has to offer!"^5^Dec 20, 2019 6:05 PM

I'm convinced the future is mirrorless and in a few years the market will have a higher percentage of mirrorless than DSLRs. I preordered the M6 + 18-150mm lens kit and it came right on release day. On my last trips to Italy and Belgium I decided to leave my Canon EOS 5D Mark III at home and take the M6 to really put it to the test. I was immediately pleased by the lightness of the camera and its EF-M 18-150mm lens. I could fit it in the pocket of my jacket. The surprise came when I took night photos with a tripod, there was no perceptible noise, way better than I expected, I wouldn't say this is the best lens for this camera, it is quite slow after all (in terms of f/stop), but it's a great all around lens for most situation with sufficient light. I also bought an adapter so I can use my large collection of Canon lenses. The video is excellent too (I've been shooting in 4K). Canon has announced a future firmware for enabling 24p.
I think this is a great first mirrorless and I can see myself moving to a full frame mirrorless and leaving my DSLRs behind in a near future. It was worth the wait. I've included 6 images taken with this camera."^5^Nov 2, 2019 10:19 PM
DaveW^/canon-eos-m6-mark-ii-mirrorless-camera-with-ef-m-15-45mm-lens-and-evf-dc2-viewfinder-silver/6373126?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"The Canon EOS M6 Mark II is Canons top of the M-series line (cropped sensor) offering, slotting in below the full frame mirrorless R series. The M series is beyond an entry level camera and is aimed more at the enthusiast market that needs a fuller feature set. This model comes in a few varieties  body only, w/ 15-45mm kit lens, and with 18-150mm kit lens. Both versions with the kit lenses also come with the optional electronic view finder (EVF) attachment. The setup I have is the 15-45mm lens kit with EVF. I originally came from a Nikon 1 J1 kit, so the M6 is a definite upgrade.

Size

The M6 is a well equipped mirrorless camera that packs a lot into a small form factor. First off, the size of the camera body is quite compact. Its not much bigger than a lot of fixed lens setups. Even with the size of its 32.5 MP APS-C sensor (22.3 x 14.9mm). Its only slightly larger than my J1 with its 10.1 MP (13.2 x 8.8mm) even with a 280% larger sensor area. Without the EVF attached the camera could easily fit in a small bag or even a coat pocket. 

Features

The camera body comes equipped with a 3 fold out touch screen that can flip forward for a selfie screen experience. You can enable the screen to use it to trigger the shutter (on by default). The M6 comes with a built-in flash which is convenient since the EVF takes up the hot shoe. The grip is part of the body and is comfortable and appropriately sized for my hand. There are 3 dials on top of the camera - shooting mode, main dial (around the shutter button), and quick control dial (around the dial function button) are easy to use. Depending on the shooting mode dial setting, the functions of the other 2 dials vary. It could be something like changing the aperture setting, iso, shutter speed, etc. Theres a selector switch on the back of the camera for auto or manual focus. Then theres the standard layout for flash, exposure, drive mode, trash, menu, gallery and record buttons. The camera body also has 3 popout covers. The one on the left side (near the flash pop up button) has a port for a microphone and for a remote control. The other side has a USB-C port to transfer pictures  no need to remove your SD car, and a mini HDMI port for connecting to a screen for playback. The battery door also has a cover that allows the cord for the DC coupler charger to be used (DR-E17 w/ CA-PS700A). The SD card slot supports fast UHS-II cards, so if you plan to do a lot of burst shooting then get the fastest card your budget allows. Im using a UHS-I Sandisk Extreme Pro 128GB card and it is fast enough for me ($40 vs $200 for the UHS-II).

There are 11 shooting modes supported by the mode dial switch. They range from auto, to movie, to manual, to different priority modes (aperture, shutter speed, etc.). Theres also the creative filter mode, which allows you to apply filters prior to shooting. Filters include B&W, fisheye, soft focus, and 4 different HDR modes. Ive messed around with these only briefly  mainly the miniatures mode which processes your image to make your subject look like its a mini figure.

Theres also the integration with the Canon Camera Connect App. I can link my phone via Bluetooth and use my phone as a remote. I can also do a WI-FI link and transfer pictures on the fly. Its a useful tool that works well.

Shooting Capabilities

So, Ive done a lot of well lit outdoor/indoor shooting days. Ive played around with the different burst modes, shooting modes, shutter speeds, and aperture settings to get a feel for the camera. So far the amount of control is well beyond what I had available on my Nikon 1. Appropriately lit shots with both cameras produced nicely rendered images. Where the M6 pulled way ahead was with low light and overlit settings. Glare from the sun overexposed on the Nikon, whereas the M6 (in auto even) easily adjusted and produced a crisp picture. Low light applications also heavily (and I mean heavily) favored the M6. I was super impressed with how well the M6 performed in low light shots. I took it out to a couple of Christmas light nights and the pics were perfect. My Nikon only produced blurs, and even my cell phone camera was no match (and its a good camera). I have dozens of crisp, clear pics that were done without the need for a flash with nothing but Christmas lights providing the ambient light. I didnt feel the need to move past the auto setting for this situation as the camera did an excellent job adjusting the ISO and exposure settings on the fly.

My 2 kids have provided me with ample opportunities for some action shots using the continuous shooting modes. The burst mode captures at a super fast 14 fps and can take somewhere around 25 pics before you fill up the buffer and need to wait. You can prioritize shutter speed or subject matter tracking with the burst shooting, so you can tailor it to your specific situation. The pictures again are clear and blur free. 

The only area I noticed some difficulty was with shooting macro. My Nikon with a little 10mm pancake lens actually gave me a little better performance in macro shots. The 15-45mm lens just softens everything up a bit too much. I could achieve a soft blur background but at the cost of softening my subject up too much. I will probably look into either the 22mm wide angle or the 28mm macro lens in the future. For now I still have my Nikon for macro stuff, which I admittedly dont do very often so Im in no rush.

Video Capabilities

The M6 can record in HD (720p @ 60fps), FHD (1080p @ 30 or 60fps), and UHD (4K @ 30fps). The onboard mic captures the audio in the recording. I dont find myself capturing too many videos yet, but I did take one of the tunnel light show at the Anheiser Busch Brewery Lights in St. Louis. It was shot in 4K in a lower light situation, and it came out surprisingly well. It wasnt too dark, recording was smooth, and the image stabilization kept up as I walked along taking the video. Using this for content creation is certainly within its wheelhouse. 

Battery Life

Unfortunately like most mirrorless cameras the battery life isnt spectacular. The listed lifespan is only 305 shots  less with the viewfinder in use. If you pop over to ECO mode (find it through the menu options) you can get a touch over 400. In default mode I was able to take around 285 pictures, while reviewing pics on the screen and occasionally using the viewfinder. It took about 2 hours for me to fully charge the battery, so if I were to take this on a long shooting day I would likely need a backup camera.


Accessories

There are quite a few accessories out for the M series as the product line continues to mature. There are currently 6 lenses available for the EF-M mount  2 macros and 4 variable (including the 15-45mm lens thats part of the kit). Theres also the EF-EOS M adapter that allows you to use EF and EF-S lenses. There are several additional speedlight accessories that attach to the hot shoe. Also for Vloggers theres the directional mic attachment for content creation. Theres no lens hood included with this kit but it is available (Hood EW-53) and just over 20 bucks.

Drawbacks

The EVF is not a standard attachment but rather a separate attachment that gets bundled together. If you want to buy just the base the EVF is an additional $200. That does make this bundle extra enticing then because the body alone is $850, and this comes with a kit lens.

Some little things to start off with. The hot shoe attachment point has a small plastic cover when not in use  same with the EVF. However, there is no place to store these when either is in use. It would be nice if a small plastic case or something was included to keep these together. 

The slide button on the lens to rotate it open/closed is difficult to use. I really dislike this feature to be honest. I was shooting with gloves on (its winter), and that little slide was annoyingly difficult to slide open. Also, and this just comes from being a Nikon user, but the rotation direction of the lens seems backwards to me. The Canon rotates CCW (Nikon is CW) and makes for odd ergonomics when opening/closing the lens. 

The slide button to open the flash is a little difficult to use. The strap tends to fall down and lay over the slide, so I have to move the strap out of the way to slide that little button. Difficulty increases with gloves on. 

Conclusion

First off, Wow this is a great camera. Definitely not a starter setup but could be used by a beginner with ease, and the documentation (as well as on-screen info) is enough to help you learn to make full use of the camera. An advanced photographer could get the most out of the feature set of this camera. I have 2 hobbyist photographers in the family that shoot on full frame DSLRs (Sony Alpha and Canon 6D?), and they were both impressed by the performance out of this little camera. I dont think Id ever convince myself to lug around a full frame DSLR, but this mirrorless crop-sensor is just the right size (same reason I like my old Nikon). I am certainly loving the excellent low light performance and the super fast shutter speed of the M6. The only real drawback with this setup that I could find was its macro performance with this lens. I fully understand a variable kit lens like the 15-45mm will have its limitations, and this just happens to be one of them. Overall this is a great setup that I think is a good fit for a wide range of camera users."^5^Dec 25, 2019 3:15 AM

At the price point of this camera I feel that I am entitled to a camera that is lightweight, easy to use, and that take high resolution pictures. I also expected most of the features found on traditional cameras. My expectations were mostly surpassed in that the camera was loaded with all of the features of traditional cameras including a variety of automatic features, a variety of additional settings (including scenic, portrait, etc). Some settings were not found on my EOS rebel but are here (including anti-flicker, auto-connect of image brightness, special effects, filters and more). All settings can be done through a Quick Control screen.

When I tested this camera, I shot all pictures on automatic, which presets the aperture and shutter speed according to measured conditions. Some pictures were taken on a fast moving boat and a few were close-ups of a backyard zebra butterfly. These conditions that optimally require a fast shutter speed took excellent pictures. A variety of textures and colors were clearly reproduced. The butterfly was captured in motion, appearing to be still. To my eye, the reproductions of color and texture were excellent, and the automatic focus at various distances was very good.

This camera has both a multi-position viewing screen and an attachable electronic view finder. Both display features for settings, and both have a shooting display showing the setting and image.

As opposed to an automatic flash, this camera indicates that a flash is warranted, requiring the user to manually raise the flash. Once set-up and synced with a smartphone, all photographs are immediately sent to the phone. Using the Canon Connect app one can do some simple edits either on the phone or in the camera.

Of concern, the lens that comes with the camera is only 15-45 mm. Lenses are interchangeable and a longer distance lens should be included with the camera. A lightweight camera is ideal for traveling, but a longer lens is a must for travelers. Unfortunately, the lenses from my Canon EOS rebel are not adaptable on this camera. A lightweight camera bag would also be an appropriate accessory.

I took this camera with me to visit family in Florida for the holidays and took this camera everywhere. I am amazed by how lightweight it is while still taking amazing pictures."^5^Dec 28, 2019 11:32 AM

CONS:
I had a very few cons but I did find them annoying enough to mention.
The viewfinder although nice for framing a shot it takes away a very valuable accessory mount, which I use with a LED lighting panel. I wish it was integrated and thus allowed you to use your accessories along with a viewfinder. 
The screen, I had a canon M50, the versatility is very limited. I liked the 180 degree spin of the LCD on the m50 as it let you frame yourself and take video unobstructed. The new screen design pops above the camera but if you are using any accessory which most people need a portable light and the shoe mount m

OVERALL a very nice camera that has AMAZING features but a few design flaws that I felt needed to be mentioned.

There are a lot of great in depth reviews of this camera out there, but Im writing this from the perspective of a beginner. This kit includes the camera body, a 15-45mm zoom lens, and a detachable electronic viewfinder. The camera body is compact, but very comfortable to hold. Even with the lens attached its still very easy to handle. The LCD screen tilts and flips to just about any angle youd need, though with the EVF attached it cannot flip all the way around.

The button and dial layouts were somewhat familiar to me from previous Canon cameras that Ive used what I didnt recognize immediately I was able to figure out after just a few minutes. All the modes are clearly laid out on the dial and settings adjustments can be made via the touchscreen or the other navigation dials.

Shooting with M6 I stuck mostly with the Intelligent Auto mode and it produced good results in lower light and excellent results outside in natural light. The pin-sharpness of the 32MP resolution really shines outside and allowed me to crop and zoom and still have a great picture at the end. I have been slowly familiarizing myself with the other modes and only expect my experience to improve and Ive been really happy with what Ive been able to get with just my limited knowledge. The video quality is good, but the options are more limited and it doesnt seem to be a focus with this camera. Transferring images back to my phone or PC was super easy with the Canon Camera Connect app.

Overall I think this is a great camera for beginners such as myself. Its small size makes it easy to handle and the interface makes shooting great photos easy. The 15-45mm zoom lens that is included is good, but I do think I will be investing in the 32mm lens at some point in the future."^5^Dec 26, 2019 8:46 AM

First 2 were Sony. I always sick to what I know. But I wanted to try what all my friends were using. And I went with this canon M6 mark2. And thank goodness I did. 
From the look and feel with its nice textured grip. To its amazing high megapixel count sensors. The weight is perfect and kills the old Sony I had. To me looks count. But obviously the picture quality is what its all about. Thats where this mirrorless take top rank in my book. 
Picture clarity and sharpness are amazing. I always was great at taking good photos. But now I can barely do anything and allow the camera to stun my friends and family. Its soo easy to use. I mainly use A+ setting as my family are usually on the run and very active. So quick set and shoot. Almost perfect every shot. 
Video is amazing as well. 4K is the standard nowadays. This camera does it beyond well. The image stabilization is crazy good. I shot a few videos at sea world. And we were blown away and how great they look. We also plan to dabble in a YouTube channel. This is perfect as we can flip up the screen to see ourselves and not have to connect an external monitor. Cant wait for you that. My kit included the electronic view find which I highly recommend. Its more than useful. Super clear. But be careful as its not permanently attached to the camera. A gift and a curse(kinda). If you want to use the flip up screen. Not a big deal for me tho. Also this canon has the free all mic plug that is usually in more expensive set up. Great add on. 
The lens has some good glass. But my only gripe is that this kit lens doesnt zoom as much as I hoped. But plenty for us. 
Another great feature is the companion app called canon camera connect. This is great for those on the go. The app allows for you to transfer the original size file photo or video directly to your phone via WiFi/Bluetooth. Ive used this and it works great and pictures look just as amazing. 

I love this camera soo much. Well built and packed with features. 
Im no pro but I am learning. And I know tech. This is well worth every penny. And if you can get it on sale. Even better. I recommend this canon m6 markii 1000%."^5^Dec 24, 2019 2:02 AM
pillboy^/canon-eos-m6-mark-ii-mirrorless-camera-with-ef-m-15-45mm-lens-and-evf-dc2-viewfinder-silver/6373126?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^1^"As much as I love this little camera, if you are looking for a simple point-and-shoot that requires a minimum amount of effort, look elsewhere. However, if you are serious about getting into photography as a hobby and are tired of the picture quality of your smartphone, read on, as this is a perfect kit for you or a wonderful gift for someone with similar aspirations.

This Canon M6 Mark II is an amazing little jewel to hold and explore. It contains a Creative Filter mode that smartphone users have come to enjoy and expect. I too have used my iPhone for many photo needs, but I am quite often put off by the wide-angle cartoonish distortion, noisy low-light graininess of the images, and digital-only zoom capability. Anyone who cares at all about the photographic history of their life owes it to themselves to invest in a real camera and spend the time needed to properly operate it and reap the full benefit of its capabilities. While the paper Getting Started guide that is packed with this camera contains 29 pages in English, the digital manual, online at Canons web site is 606 pages long, chock full of information on what this little powerhouse of a camera can do.

If you are contemplating a purchase at this price point, you are either an enthusiast that might have a bit of an investment in photo equipment and will probably buy based on the brand of that equipment so that you can utilize lenses you already own or you are ready to jump in head first and will choose what best fits your perceived needs. If you are one of the latter, you will not be disappointed in this Canon. It takes first rate still pictures at 32 megapixels thus allowing you the luxury of cropping and still being able to enlarge the image and having a shot you can be proud to share and display. Combine that with 4K video capability4Kat homeboggles my mindand you have what you need to become your own director. Throw this up on a 4K capable television and all I can say is stunningabsolutely stunning. What this does compared to tech I grew up with and grew old with is simply amazing. Still photos taken at 14 frames-per-second! No more missed shots, or imperfect timing. The 4K video is at 30 frames-per-second and full High-Def at 60 fps! There is supposed to be an upcoming firmware update to allow 24 fps for videophiles that prefer that frame-rate which is the same as the motion picture industry uses. That makes for video that we are already accustomed to viewing as the eye can perceive the subtle difference in appearance between 24 and 30 frames-per-second.

Im going to touch on a few of the many positives of this Canon first. The LCD screen on the back of the camera is a touchscreen which, if you have ever slogged through menus using a directional pad (cross keys) and the Set button, is a godsend. The screen on the M6 Mark II is so easy to use that it is just as responsive as that on any smartphone I have ever used. Now combine that with the fact that the screen tilts to give you flexibility in how and where you hold the camera to frame a shot - down low or up high over a crowd. The screen even folds up over the camera body 180 degrees so that you can see it from the front of the camera for taking selfies! This camera has the right amount of hard button controls, dials and switches and buttons, to make using it a real pleasure. It can be a little intimidating at first, but the more you use it, the more intuitive it becomes. Your fingers fall right into place to make using the controls simply by feel, become second nature in just a short time. And even more goodness is the ability to custom program just about all of the buttons and dials to the functions you desire and use frequently. This kind of custom tailoring makes using the camera so mush easier as you can build it to your liking. For those with some idea about basic camera functions, the M6 has two shutters, an electronic shutter that is typically found on mirrorless cameras and a mechanical shutter which is usually found on single-lens reflex cameras. Both types of shutters have their own pros and cons, which is too involved to discuss here, but it is advantageous to have both types of shutters. The electronic shutter can shoot form 1/16000th of a second to 30 seconds and the mechanical shutter from 1/4000th of a second to 30 seconds. An ISO range of 100 to 25600 gives you the ability to shoot in low light conditions without using a flash. These specs are just amazing. The body and electronic view finder (EVF) hardware are made in Japan and the lens in this kit was manufactured in Taiwan. To take nothing away from the lens (although it appears to be mostly plastic/composite construction, thus lightness), the quality of the feel and appearance of the body are about as close to excellence as you can get in my opinion and are so pleasant to hold and manipulate - I just love the feel of well made hardware. 

There is a single slot for an SD memory card and it is located under the same door on the bottom plate as the battery. Pro-grade cameras usually have two memory card slots, but I doubt even the serious amateurs will miss the second slot. The user manual states that there is no size limit to the memory cards the camera can support. The camera supports the newest UHS-II cards (Ultra High Speed), but I was able to record 4K video with an UHS-I card with no issues. The manual states to use UHS-II memory cards when you plan to shoot RAW format images in burst mode (these are large files that have to be saved very quickly). To watch playback on your big-screen TV, you will need to purchase a cable that is HDMI Type-A on one end (the TV end) and HDMI Type-D (the camera end). These are available for a reasonable price from the aftermarket. There are eight Canon EF-M lenses available that range from 11mm focal length to 200mm - in 35mm camera-speak that is from 18mm (wide angle) to 320mm (telephoto), where 50mm is a normal lensit sees the scene the way the human eye sees it. If you have never had a camera system with interchangeable lens capability, you will be amazed at the wide scope of functionality it affords you, especially over using your smartphone. The variety of OEM lenses are prime (single, fixed focal length), zoom (multiple magnifications from wide angle to telephoto), and even a macro lens for extreme close-ups. After buying full-frame lenses for my DSLR, it is a treat to look at the reasonable prices for these M-Series lenses. This 15-45mm lens that comes in the kit has a sliding button on the barrel of the lens that needs to be used while slightly rotating the lens to enable the use of it. While I had never seen this before and found it a little cumbersome at first, I quickly became accustomed to it. Not all of the Canon lenses incorporate this feature, however.

Now for the things I was slightly less than enthused about. The electronic view finder is basically a tiny LCD screen that you put your eye up to rather than looking at the large LCD screen on the back of the camera at arms length. This mainly helps you to compose shots when you are in bright sunlight that washes out the big LCD screen and also lets you concentrate on composition with less distractions. On the M6 Mark II this little view finder is an extra piece of hardware that attaches to the camera on the hot shoe accessory attachment point. This means two things, you have another piece of equipment to carry around in case you need it and it uses up the hot shoe spot meaning you cannot simultaneously use an accessory flash or other hot shoe-mounted item like an external microphone for video recording. It also makes the camera look less sleek in appearance, but at the same time it keeps the body dimensions at an absolute minimum. This EVF also has some excessive color saturation and the scenes you are looking at are more vivid than they naturally appear to be - probably a minor issue at worst. And speaking of using a flash, the camera has a built-in pop-up flash. However this flash does not automatically deploy from the its hiding spot when needed like on some other cameras, but you have to push a mechanical switch on the side of the camera for it to extend. I guess the nice thing about that is that you dont have the flash inadvertently firing for a scene where you want just ambient lighting. This is different than what I am used to, so it might not be a negative for some people. The flash can also be manually pushed up with a finger on your left hand to make the light bounce off the ceiling for softer lighting with less harsh shadows, a handy feature. The battery gauge on the display is a simple three segment icon that looks like a little AA battery. I would have hoped for a digital battery-percentage remaining like I am used to seeing on my cell phone so that it might give me a more realistic expectation of existing battery life. Battery life is not as good as some other cameras, but this is going to be strictly a function of physical size of the battery and how much the user utilizes the main LCD screen.

If I was shopping for an advanced-amateur camera today, I would have to give serious consideration to choosing the Canon M6 Mark II over my digital single-lens reflex, thus saving myself a bunch of cash and making it so much easier to take the whole system with me when traveling or going out in the field on a shoot for fun. This Canon is currently one of the most advanced and feature-filled mirrorless cameras on the market and one that will provide the average user with plenty to grow into as their skills develop. Your future self will thank you for the fantastic photographic memories that this camera will provide in the years to come. Dont waste any more special moments and events using only a smartphone to record them."^5^Dec 25, 2019 9:58 PM

I have been shooting with the Nikon D3s, and the Nikon D3x. Shooting with the Z7 is a joy! The auto focus is spot on, and manual focus is fine as well. I looked at Sony, Canon, Panasonic mirror less cameras and I decided to go with the Z7. I also purchased the 24 70 2.8 s to go along with the Z and I must say it is the best lens I have ever used next to my Leica Sumicron f2. I am so very happy with my purchase!"^5^May 5, 2019 10:21 AM
HappyFunGuy^/nikon-z7-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6292223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^22^0^"I own a Nikon D850 and have a bunch of expensive lenses, so getting the Z7 with the FTZ adapter was something I was looking forward to.

It took a couple days of testing to get really comfortable with the Z7 because some things are different from the DSLRs, but many things are the same, so it isn't a completely new experience if you have used a Nikon DSLR from the last 10 years. Most of the controls are there, they just may be in different menu locations.

The displays, including the EVF are amazing. Seeing the exposure in the EVF before you take the shot helps so much in manual mode as the meter may under/over expose a little when you really want to nudge the exposure the other way, I like to get as close as possible to the final image from the camera, even though I always shoot RAW (NEF).

So far, I took both my D850 and the Z7 to Las Vegas with the idea that I would focus on the Z7 and use the D850 if required. Well, I didn't even pull the D850 out of my bag. I used my Z7 the whole time and never found that I was lacking anything. 

That said, I would probably still use my D850 for a lot of the fast action images like sports, at least for now. I don't think I'm comfortable enough with the Z7 for extremely fast action shots."^5^Oct 12, 2018 12:19 PM

The Z7 is much lighter\smaller than DSLR's and much easier to handle, carry and travel with, especially when dealing with weight restrictions (like African safaris and other remote places). The only downside that I have seen is there are fewer usable buttons, due to the smaller size, and you have to use menus to access certain features typically available on DSLRs."^5^Dec 21, 2018 7:07 PM
NovicePhotographer^/nikon-z7-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6292223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"This is the best camera I have ever owned. The pictures are great. we used it on a trip out to Moab, UT to take night photos. 1st time doing that too. I was given the camera setting to use by a friend in order to shoot the milky way. ISO was supposed to be 1800, but I made the mistake of setting it at 180. Well, the camera shot was awesome at 180 ISO. Hmm... not sure how that worked, but it did. Day shots and low-light shots are great/fantastic.

I have noticed that the bright light shots are too light on auto. It performs much better on manual with some slight adjustments to tone down the pic. 

Keep in mind that the older or cheaper DX lenses don't really work on this camera. I bought a 28mm to 300mm Nikon VR lense that is perfect. Shot the night sky with a 1.8f 35 mm lens."^5^Jul 12, 2019 3:49 PM

RoosterBeak^/nikon-z7-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6292223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"I have owned the Nikon Z7 for a couple of weeks now and could not be more impressed. The build is very sturdy and the grip feels great in my hand. 

- Resolution: The Z7's 45.7MP sensor captures HUGE images with incredible detail.  

- Dynamic Range: The dynamic range of the Z7 is incredible. When pulling up blacks from an underexposed image or dark area in an image, the detail is preserved with very little noise.

- ISO Range: The ISO range is very capable on the Z7. With a range from 64-25600 and extended ranges of (Max) 10240 (Min) 32. I am able to capture crisp clean images in well-lit situations and am able to push the ISO beyond where I ever have before and still have acceptable images. The cameras high resolution also helps, reducing the size of the pixels creates a smaller noise field. 
  
- Z mount: Admittedly I do not own a Z-mount capable lens yet. However, I am able to use FTZ mount adaptor and use all of my F-mount lenses with autofocus. The only lens I am not able to use auto-focus on is my Tamron 150-600. However, I am able to manually focus it and still produce excellent results. 

Some Features I love: 
- Focus Peaking: While in manual focus mode the camera shows you where your focus point is by outlining the areas in a color you choose. This is very handy when shooting macro shots or wide landscape shots to make sure your focus is where you want it. 

- Delayed exposer: You are able to choose from .2 to 3 seconds to delay the time between pressing the shutter release button and when the shutter actuates. This is extremely handy when capturing long exposer images. I almost never carry my remote with me anymore. 

- Live View: 'Live View' shows you how your camera settings affect the image on the back display and in the viewfinder, effectively reducing the number of sample photos taken to get the exposure you want. You are able to turn 'Live View' off if it does not suit your style or in low light situations. 

- Auto Focus Points: With 493 autofocus points you are able to choose virtually any point in the frame to focus on. 

What I don't love:
- Battery life: Although it is not great it is the worst I have seen. I am able to get by with only one battery (for now) without many issues. 

-  Only one memory card slot: The XQD memory card that the Z7 uses is amazingly fast and reliable, it would just be nice to have that extra piece of mind with a back-up card. That being said I have not lost any images yet. 


- Overall: I could not be happier with my purchase. There are so many features and customization options that I will never be left wanting."^5^Jun 19, 2019 10:48 AM
Ryan^/nikon-z7-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6292223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I've had this camera for a few days and can't say enough about the image quality.  Probably the best Nikon has produced.

My only complaint so far is that there is no autofocus motor built into the camera body like I had on my D610.  What that means is that my D series Nikon lenses lost their auto focus capability.  So now I have to work on my focusing skills, which is a challenge with my old eyes.

So if you have D series or older lenses with no autofocus motor in the lens, you will have to manually focus with those lenses."^4^Jun 25, 2019 11:41 AM
sirhawkeye^/nikon-z7-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black/6292223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^3^"Overall, a good start for NIkon. This is a direct competitor to the Sony A7R III. My biggest concern with the Z7 is it's Auto Focus performance. Even with v2.0 firmware, I still feel it lags behind that of Sony still, but is slightly improved over previous firmware versions, so there is still room for improvement. If you own a lot of Nikon lenses (F-Mount) then this is a good choice. If you don't, maybe consider the Sony (or if you only have a few lenses or not much money invested in Nikon lenses). Or if you want better low-light performance, get the Z6 instead. The people who will benefit from the Z7 the most are those who are printing and need the high resolution. There is noticeable noise starting around ISO 3200 just as an FYI, based on my experience. IBIS is nice (just had mine serviced under the recall, so if you get one, make sure to check to see yours is not affected by the IBIS issue). Overall, I would recommend the camera. Grip is nice (one thing that Sony still struggles with that NIkon/Canon got right the first time). Plenty of customizable buttons Touch screen is nice but I don't use it for taking pictures (only for navigating menus mainly). Get it while you can while it's on sale. Don't forget you'll need XQD cards (supposedly the Z6 and Z7 will be compatible with CFExpress cards too when available via firmware update). As a side note, only the 15B batteries can be charged in-camera. 15/15A batteries will still work ,but CANNOT be charged in the camera via USB."^4^Jun 2, 2019 7:42 PM

Dont listen to the bad reviews regarding the autofocus; autofocus is working just fine on this camera and actually it is improved over the GH4. I very much like the slightly larger (about 10%) body, on all the previous models I used to have a battery grip attached just so I can hold it better and have a better grip on the camera but so far it seems I dont need a battery grip at all for the GH5.

Afterward, I picked up an a6500. My latest purchase was this gem. Looking back, I actually think I would have preferred the A7S II as my first camera. In my mind, the R has just one advantage over the S, and that is the 44 MP sensor. The R allows you to recompose any shot you could ever want down to about the smallest crop you could image. I'm talking printable images with 400% crop. This has really helped produce some phenomenal shots. Now, if you are an expert at composition and/or you take a ton of pictures every time you shoot, the advantage of the R is really lost. The S operates faster, has almost the same image quality (in real world shots), and is an ABSOLUTE BEAST as a video camera. The superior in body stabilization (side by side to the R, the S is just better), SLog 3, gamma assist, slow motion, and UNREAL low light performance make this a better camera.

If video is what you're out to do, I would recommend this camera for all around run and gun work. I also own the a7rII, and I actually prefer the R over the S, but the S has better low light capabilities, especially in full frame mode. the R will have to be in APSC mode to be comparable to the S (which is mainly what I shoot at). The S shoots great low light footage in 4K and also 120fps slow mo in full HD 1080p (the R shoots at 720p in 120fps).

I use the 18-135mm lens and with each photograph, there is a shadow ring on the bottom of the image. People will tell you just use an external flash - but that is why I bought this camera NOT to use an external flash. However, when speaking to a Best Buy camera rep, he indicated that I could up the ISO considerably without any big issues with noise or grain. For the most part, he was right. I have shot photographs using an ISO of 10,000 - a little grainy, but not bad compared with what it would have been with a regular camera. There is a lot to learn using this camera so be prepared to read and view the YouTube videos. The online Sony user guide does not adress a lot of the issues. So, now I bring both cameras along.

Like most cameras, it's not perfect, but I have found it to be an overall outstanding camera.
Rather than write a long, long story, I'll get into the pros and cons.
First, I purchased this as an 'Open Box' deal from Best Buy and probably saved about $500 at the time of purchase.

PROS
- Great full-frame sensor with excellent resolving power. Colors are accurate, and noise is reasonably well controlled. I don't have any issues with this sensor.
- FAST! When set to Continuous Shooting - High, you'll be impressed with how quickly it rattles off shot after shot. I've been shooting some fashion runway shows, and you need a fast camera. This fits the bill.
- Electronic viewfinder. Compared with an optical viewfinder, I would go with an electronic viewfinder any day. This allows you to see real-time changes when setting white balance, and there is no comparison when it comes to magnified views for manual focus.
- Quality of construction. This camera is built rock solid. It has a good amount of heft to it. You can tell that this is built to stand up to hard use.
- The various markings are engraved and filled, which means that they won't wear off in a couple of years. Unlike other cameras that I've owned.
- You can easily dial in exposure compensation or magnify the image for manual focus. I have found this to be a very friendly camera. I don't have to 'fight' the camera to use it.

CONS
- The body is too short. I have average-sized man hands, and the camera needs to be a bit taller for a firm grip. I bought an aftermarket battery grip, which makes it a bit too tall (win some, lose some).
- Getting to some menu items requires too many button presses. In general, the camera takes the Asian design approach of filling most space on the body with buttons and dials and leaving it up to you to memorize the location and function of each. I actually don't have a solution to this.
- Major battery hog. In addition to the limited number of frames per battery charge, this camera seems to suck power even when it's turned off. After a week, the battery usually has dipped to about 60%. I went to an external battery solution, because the worst thing to happen is to lose power in the middle of a shoot.

OTHER COMMENTS
I sold the kit lens, as I found that I rarely used it. It's a bit larger than I wanted for a kit lens, and instead I bought the Sony G 70-200mm zoom, which was used to take the attached image.
When I want to use a kit zoom, I borrow the one from my Sony NEX-7. This lens is average at best.
I have only shot a few minutes of video, as I have dedicated video cameras, so I can't speak to video performance.
This camera has heft to it, and when I get really lazy, I opt for the NEX-7.
When shooting with manual focus lenses, I found that my hit rate decreased. Using a manual focus lens with a full-frame sensor requires more attention when focusing. I tend to use the magnify function, which makes a difference.
Overall, I think this is an awesome camera. It is well worth the money that I paid.
The black and white shot was taken with my manual-focus Rollei QBM f/1.8 50mm Planar - my favorite SLR lens."^5^Oct 10, 2017 1:45 PM

Unfortunately in video mode with continuous auto focus turned on, noise from the auto focus motors was picked up on the audio track by the internal mic. As a result I subsequently returned it and purchased the Sony A7 mk2 instead. I am much happier with this purchase and found the A7 mk2 to be technologically way ahead of the 750. Some of the features I like:

-Electronic view finder. All menus and selections visible on the LCD are also visible in the viewfinder, including all live view changes.
-Smaller and lighter than any DSLR - means I can now carry a smaller lighter camera bag.
- 5 axis stabilization !! Absolutely amazing.
-Focus peaking  during manual focus, camera can highlight parts of the image that are within the focused depth of field which proves for highly accurate focusing.
-Completely silent continuous autofocus during video recording.
-NFC for quick transfer of images to my cell phone.
-WiFi tethering for quick upload of images to my computer.
-Articulating LCD screen for multiple viewing angles.
-Not only does it have face tracking but also face registration where you can teach the camera to recognize up to 8 faces. It will then auto focus on those faces using the priority you specify."^5^Jan 7, 2015 9:08 PM
THORTHEFIFTH^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-with-28-70mm-lens-black/1634012?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^40^8^"The A7 Mark II may seem like a minor upgrade from the original and a step in the wrong direction when comparing to the A7s but, this camera is an amazing device with some amazing qualities. First, let me tell you the cons: Battery life leaves you a bit disappointed especially when you use the features you bought the camera for, The native lens choices are abysmal and It doesn't have that mind blowing low light ability. The Pros far outweigh the few cons, I assure you. The camera is full frame. In fact, this is one of the cheapest full frame cameras on the market. It has a healthy 24MP sensor that easily compares to the 5D Mark III in the tests I've run. The best part of any mirrorless camera is the ability to adapt lenses and that is where this particular camera will blow your mind. The biggest draw here is the In-Body-Image-Stabilization, IBIS, that allows you to use any full frame lenses, with proper adapter including canon auto focus glass, with stabilization. This isn't a substitute for Optical Stabilization but believe me, it works very well. To see this on a full frame camera is a blessing. This camera also includes a few of the video upgrades from the A7s including the video codec which works very well and stands its ground against the 5D. I highly recommend this camera to anyone interested in breaking free of a single lens system and wanting the incredible versatility of a Mirrorless system along with the image stabilization features. While it's no slouch, you might want to look at the A7s or GH4 if video is your focus. For Photos, this is the winner."^5^Jan 23, 2015 5:44 PM
Yarnim^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-with-28-70mm-lens-black/1634012?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^27^6^"There are many independent reviews out there from blogs and dedicated photo forums, but average buyer reviews on the A7 II on major retailers sites are relatively rare. I think it may be due to the recent overflow of new tech introduction and so many cameras going on sale, especially on the sony side with four different lines of A7, ever so popular A6000 etc and Sony's aggressive pricing.

Anyhow, on to the camera.

Ergonomics: Though it comes down to what the user prefers or is used to, I personally think the A7 ii is by far the best thought out camera sony has ever introduced as far as ergonomics and camera controls go. It feels great in the hand, just adds about the right weight to balance between rather big and heavy lenses for the body's size.

Build: The camera to me, reminds me a lot of the NEX 6 build, which is a very good thing. It may be closer to NEX 7, but Ive never held one personally. Of course, it has that added weather sealing so no doubt better. However, there are definitely some quirks such as port and card placements etc. I'm sure Sony had reasons but every port / battery etc cover on this thing opens up differently. Most of them are pretty easy to figure out but that USB door is always so difficult for me to pull out but it is a minor annoyance.

The bigger issue is the memory card slot that feels extremely flimsy and flaps open really easily just by the friction against your hand, palm whatever and today it opened as I was pulling it out of the bag. I am afraid that flimsy thing is going to break and fall out.

IQ: It uses an exact same sensor that is in the A7. There are added focus points and supposedly a faster AF, but there is just not going to be a worlds of difference from the original. Real strength of course if the 5axis IS but if you do not plan on using the camera with lenses that lack OSS, this is of no benefit to you at all. It should help with videos, but I'm not a video guy and a lot of reviews seem to indicate the performance improvement is rather minimal. There were also the notorious hallation effect on the A7 sensor, which is still somewhat present with the A7 II. Shooting in low light conditions with a lot of artificial lights? You should go with a different camera. But for everything else (minus BIF / fast sports), the A7 ii simply delivers.

There are also a known issue of the camera just going poof, with some camera error that cannot be fixed unless sent in to sony for service, which upon research, seem to have to do with the 5axis IS or EFCS. A lot of users report this issue sometimes right out of the new box, sometimes a few weeks in, etc. Again, you cannot fix this yourself. It must be sent back to Sony. Looks like they repair it under warranty. I don't think any of the A7ii out are out of their warranty periods, so if that ever happens to anyone outside warranty, Im not sure what they'll do, but something to keep in mind, as it is not uncommon issue.

The biggest drawback: Sony depreciation. It simply sucks.
If you are cost sensitive person, Do NOT buy any sony camera upon release or at MSRP. You will regret."^4^Jun 7, 2015 12:50 AM

Everything about the camera is awesome except the battery life. I am very satisfied and I haven't looked back."^5^Mar 26, 2016 8:54 PM
jbrooks^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-with-28-70mm-lens-black/1634012?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^8^1^"Sony has pulled out all the stops on their A7 line of mirrorless cameras and the A7II is no exception. They are so far ahead of the game when it comes to these cameras that the other brands haven't even announced a compact mirrorless full frame and Sony has already released 7 of them. The camera has nearly every feature you could want and the customizable buttons are nothing short of wonderful. Yes the lens selection could be better but it continues to grow with exceptional products and you cannot argue that it's only getting better - especially with the introduction of the Zeiss Loxia 21mm f/2.8 and the Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2. When a company like Zeiss takes the time to put out amazing lenses like these, one should take notice and know that there is a bright future ahead for both the A7 series and the e-mount lens ecosystem. If you're making a switch from canon or Nikon, their are top of the line electronic lens adapters that allow you to keep your current set of glass and if you're in the a-mount family already, the Sony adapters are awesome - especially with the most recent firmware update which enhances the autofocus via the adapters to nearly native response times. Sony is just getting started with full frame mirrorless cameras and I'm very proud to be an owner of their A7II after owning the NEX-5N for years prior!"^5^Nov 28, 2015 7:43 PM
planesta^/sony-alpha-a7-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-video-camera-with-28-70mm-lens-black/1634012?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"I chose the Sony a7 platform for many reasons but the primary was due to the mirrorless design.. Mirrorless caused the camera to be much smaller than DSLR equivalents which was a big concern of mine due to the type of photography I was wanting to focus on (Adventure motorcycling/landscape/wilderness) but also has the flexibility to be a fantastic portrait and lifestyle camera as well. Another benefit of mirrorless is due to the EVF (electronic view finder) giving you a representation of what you are going to get before you take the picture.. Unlike typical glass/mirror cameras where you are optically looking at the subject the EVF allows the application of settings to show through making it easier to get that first shot closer to what you are wanting.

This is a fantastic camera for the price and allows you to get into professional level photography for a great price allowing you to focus on quality lenses that fit the e-mount or a-mount (this camera supports both a-mount lenses and canon lenses with inexpensive adapters) platform. As you continue to build you have a lens platform that will be around for years to come.

I also do videos and this model supports quality video as well as (with a cable adapter) wireless mics making it a great platform for run and gun video shooting with quality depth of field you only find in high end movie cameras. I can record non-stop for 30 minutes making it perfect for the type recording I do. I would love to record longer than that but this seems to be a pretty standard limit on most DSLR's due to overheating concerns.

I definitely recommend this camera. One thing to note is the lenses for this camera do tend to run higher than the comparable canon or nikon.. For my needs the mirrorless design outweighed the negative of the extra cost in lenses and if I were moving from another platform it wouldn't even be a consideration due to the adapter option for cross platform lenses.. (note- you do lose focus control and other features when using cross platform lenses)

I was also able to purchase a Godox speed light flash with wireless trigger for ridiculous low price and it works in conjunction with the Sony perfectly... So if flash is a need that is your option.. Godox TT685s

Great camera,

This camera takes amazing photos, is much more portable than others, and the built-in image stabilization is an awesome feature. Slap in a 256 SD card (>$100), and you are good to go!

There was an instance where a professional photographer was going around taking photos for people on our recent cruise, and when he saw the A7ii, he commented that he wished he had one.

**One thing to note though, and that is that the screen on this camera is pretty easy to scratch... I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you get a screen protector for this. It is an insignificant cost to protect your $2k camera."^5^Aug 5, 2015 1:26 PM

However, It will take me a while to get the bad taste out of my mouth when I use it because of the way I was treated by the store manager at the Pasadena store.
I purchased an open box camera that clearly stated that all the accessories were in the box. Upon inspection, none of the accessories were in the box. I asked for a further markdown, which the salesperson said is customarily 5-10 %. That would cover the missing accessories so I was okay with that. When the salesperson came back, he said the manager was only wiling to reduce the price an additional $20. Plus I could get the great additional discount of 25% off three accessories. I told them I didn't need 3 accessories, just the missing Sony charger.
As an aside, all of the accessories are priced significantly higher in the store vs. Bestbuy's own website so, you're not getting a discount at all. ( example: Sony battery-$79.99 in store, $51.99 on their website; battery charger-$49.99 in store, $39.99 on website. 
So, back to my long winded story.
I ask for the store manager and explain that i just want the discount to reflect the missing pieces, since the basis for the original discounted price included the accessories. The label also states that there were some scratches. He examines the camera and doesn't see any scratches, so he tells me if I don't buy the camera now he's going to reprice it higher, so buy it now or lose out. I frankly didn't see any scratches at the time either, so I say fine I'll take the camera with the $20 discount for the missing accesories and be on my way. He tells me he's not going to honor that offer anymore and I have to buy the charger and he'll take the $20 off the charger instead. Well, guess what? The charger is $10 cheaper on their own website, so now my deal is really only $10 off and I was forced to buy a charger to get it.
I still bought the camera, but was mildly irritated with the whole interaction. I was basically made to feel like he was doing me a favor by 'letting' me have it at the price that was already marked. Well, I get it home and it turns out it is scratched and it's not just cosmetic. After cleaning the monitor the were a few small scratches, so it was discounted properly after all.
So I went back to Bestbuy today, not to complain, but to buy a case for the camera. I just happened to bump into the store manager and tell him BTW the camera was scratched after all. His response was that I still got a good deal and that the offer of 25% three accessories still stands.
Wow, really! Thanks for the generous offer that is availible to ANYONE who shops at Bestbuy on your overpriced accesories. And that's competing with their own website. Don't even get me started on 'real world' prices that can be found on the internet.
He could've just let me have the camera for the original deal of $20 off the camera (a whopping additional discount of 1.5%) and I wouldn't be writing this. Instead, i got my arm twisted into buying a charger I could've easily found cheaper online. So my effective discount ended up being zero. Now, I'm completely ticked off and will never be shopping at Bestbuy again. I'm not sure if they've noticed, but are other choices out there to shop. Never shopping there again. NEVER AGAIN."^5^Dec 10, 2016 3:06 AM

A7 mark Ii has body image stablization in which A7 does not.
A7 mark II focuses about 30% faster than A7
A7 ii's Body is full magnesium and A7 is partial.
A7 II's grip is better in my opition, especially when you have big hands or use it with big lens.
A7 ii is about 600$ more expensive.
Everything else is about the same
So, is it worth to pay 600$ different? The answer is yes if you plan using all in one zoom or long range lens or in dimmed light condition."^5^Sep 16, 2015 9:25 AM

I had previously owned Canon 7D and Rebel XT bodies and an assortment of lenses. I loved the lighter weight and was very satisfied with the image quality. Along comes the a7 full frame series. I was intrigued, but it wasn't until the a7 II came along that I was ready to pull the trigger. The images from this new camera are really excellent, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The only negatives to this camera are a continued paucity of FE lenses and lousy battery life. Sony has announced some new lenses, but nothing has hit the market yet. I will order the FE 24-240 as soon as it appears. (Aside: I have used a Tamron E-mount 18-200 lens on the a7 II and it works fine, but obviously is not a full-frame lens.)

Best Buy was great and said - this type of thing happens in the production line, nothing you did would have caused this. They asked if I wanted the same camera - and I said of course.

I was in New York at the time when the camera when completely out and would make a connection to the lens and the repair place was there. Left it with them and they finally contacted me 2 weeks later, due to Sony would not contact them. When they did they said the part is no longer available. Now this is a camera that hasn't even been out a year. The new part is on back order for another 5-6 weeks. So I called Sony and explain the situation. and they said they will call me in a week to discuss my situation. A week to talk about it not make a move about fixing. After countless calls to them they finally called me a few days later. Then they asked for a copy of the receipt to be emailed to them, then they will review and contact me in a few days. Just more and more time wasted. And when i asked the company that repairs the camera if the is a random problem with Sony they said NO. They never have parts available and they will send email after email to Sony has well and never get responses. Sony has the worse customer support and would never buy another Sony product. After selling all of my Nikon camera gear to switch to Sony I will now be switching back.... Then they called and said if i want a refund they can do so and i would receive a check in about 2 months.

Sony has always been my favorite. I love everything about them. This model of camera was a gift from my husband for Christmas. I have been wanting a full frame for awhile but couldnt justify spending the money on one. He said he got a very good deal with this one. So far I am very impressed with how fast it is compared with my Sony a6000. Some of the settings are in different places so I am still learning how to use the camera, but I am very impressed so far. The images are beautiful even in low light. (I took pics of my 6mo baby with no light except Christmas lights) The only down side would be how much heavier it is compared to my a6000.

I used it with a third party adapter and it has renewed my interest in photography. Thein camera image stabilization works well with the old lenses and the assignable menu buttons make this camera fun to work with. I understand that movie recording works well with the a7II however Im just enjoying using it for stills for now. As for other reviews about bad battery life, those reviewers are too young or dont remember what it was like to change a roll of 35mm film. The bottom line is if you have old glass this is a great choice however if your just starting out you would be better off with another brand due to the limited Sony lenses and their costs."^4^Dec 3, 2015 3:02 PM

Once it got here today I followed the directions to a 'T' plugged it in let it charge the whole way placed it upside down so dirt and debree doesn't enter it while putting the lens on, lined up the dot..literally everything. I get my camera on after the battery finished charging and wouldn't you know it keeps popping up an error message 'camera error. Turn power off then on.' So I did as it said. Over and over again..then removed battery 4 or 5 times turning it back on each time to receive the same message. It takes about 15 seconds or so for the message to show up but it inevitably does. When in settings the camera kicks me out of settings or whatever it is I am doing in the camera, setting iso etc. This is so very annoying considering I use this for my business. Sony will not be receiving anymore business from me.

1. It didn't take photos that were any better than my older cropped sensor A57 sony SLR. This was true in low light, capturing motion, daytime photos, etc (a variety of conditions). 
2. The photos this did take were often blurry because this camera just isn't fast. It's slow to react and laggy. The auto focus left a lot to be desired. 
3. Even in manual mode, I found that this camera didn't give me much more than my 6 year old camera that cost 1/3rd as much. The new technology wasn't palpable. 
4. A lot that makes up good photos is good glass. There aren't many lenses to choose from relative to Canon or Nikon and the lenses out there that are for the A7ii are very expensive for what they are. There's also far smaller of a used market for Sony cameras and lenses and that's going to affect how much you spend for their products and how much you're going to get when you try to sell them. 

This isn't a bad camera, it's just not a camera that feels very 'professional grade.' You could purchase a camera that is just as good for a third or half as much from Canon, Nikon, or even, Sony. Yes, the Sony SLRs are a whole lot better than their own mirrorless. 

I don't think mirrorless is ready for prime time quite yet. 

As for the battery, the last straw for me was when I went to a wedding and I ran out of a fully charged battery in 2 hours. I ended up going back into the car and getting my trusty old A57 and enjoyed using the old camera even more than the new one. The pictures were every bit as good too.

The build quality of the camera body is excellent and the button layout has a lot of customization options. When paired with a fast E-mount prime lens such as the Zeiss 35mm 2.8 or the Sony 50mm 1.8 OSS the camera produces excellent images that rival or surpass results from other competing mirrorless/DSLR cameras that use an APS-C size sensor. Video quality is also best in class.
The autofocus is extremely fast and accurate, even in continuous mode an area where competing mirrorless cameras fare poorly.

However I am still learning the camera with time permitting. I bought the 210mm, 50mm Macro and the Bower Fisheye. I am impressed all the way around. Pictures are sharp, colors are vivid. Will I switch from Canon to Sony, NO!
The Sony will come in handy using the fisheye for weddings, and sunsets. Canon does have the fisheye lens of course but, I saved money and bought the Sony (that I wanted) with 3 lenses for what I would of paid for the Canon fisheye lens. I am a Happy Shooter!

The specs of these two cameras is well reviewed online with detailed information on both. If you are interested in the Sony mirrorless and a small size DSLR camera the only comment I can add is price. Sony and BestBuy pricing has the a6000 body now at about one third the price of the a6300 body when you consider the add-on free items. You can buy 3 a6000's, not that you would, but it sure keeps $$ in your pocket for an extra Sony lens or other items. As an amateur photographer for many years I would certainly consider the a6000. It is still after two years on the market a fantastic camera and one of the best selling small, mirrorless DSLRs out there. You will not be disappointed."^5^May 6, 2016 8:06 PM

What makes the Sony A6000 stand out is how fast and how accurately it focuses. I am attaching a head crop from a casual shot of my daughter at the swimming pool, first day I had this camera; lens was a Sony/Zeiss 16-70 F4. Focus just doesn't get any better. 
 There's the new A6300 which is even faster, and with a few more options including S Log 2 and 3 and 4k video, but for hundreds of dollars more. On good thing, the 6300 does us the favor of causing some discounts on the A-6000 that make it just an incredible value. I also have and recommend the Nikon D5500...if it is fairly comparably priced. Either of these cameras regularly produces shots of a quality unknown on any digital camera only 10 years ago. And for both, excellent lenses are available at pretty reasonable prices.

John^/sony-alpha-a6000-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/3396009?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The Sony - Alpha A6000 Mirrorless Camera uses an APS-C sensor (smaller than 'full frame') that has high resolution and captures wide dynamic range, though it suffers from the smaller sensor size and that means more noise at higher ISO levels... Practically speaking that means pictures taken at lower light will 'strain' the sensor to gather light, and that may result in diminished image quality... That said, the image quality (IQ) of the camera is generally quite good to excellent, though you will encounter some noise at higher ISO levels. 

With the advent of the Sony 6300 and 6500, this camera body is a bit out of date, too. The never revisions of this camera are better in terms of sensor resolution, ISO levels, dynamic range, and buffer size for faster shooting. If I had to choose all over again, I would pay the extra for the 6300 (or 6500) and pass on this model."^4^Dec 23, 2016 6:17 PM

This camera right here is competing against 1,000$ camera. The reason why I love it so much it's cause how small it is compared to normal dslr.

It's take pictures at 24.3 megapixels most camera are at 18-20 megapixels. & another thing that caught my attention of this camera is the frames per second most dslr camera the 'higher end' camera tend to have 4-6 frames per second wich is nothing compared to the a6000 the a6000 is at 11 frames per second and he reason why this is a must is cause I take a bunch of baby pictures and we all know how much they move so when I use this a6000 at 11 frames per seconds it takes so manny quick pictures so manny that I never miss the shot apose to a normal dslr might have to retake the picture a couple of times."^5^Dec 8, 2016 9:29 AM

I wanted a camera that would keep up with me like my Canon 1DX/5D. This little guy is a pretty perfect compromise in size and capability.

The image quality is akin to what I see in a Canon Rebel, which is a fine camera. The speed of operation with the available dials helps me get the shot quickly - exposure compensation and aperture adjustments. There is a back dial that can be set to quickly change ISO, WB and other things, but I haven't fully utilized it as I'm not used to it yet.

The kit lens is quite slow, but versatile in the available focal length for casual shoots. I've bought the Canon EF Mount Adapter so I can use my other lenses, but haven't really found it useful yet since I have to deal with the 1.6x crop. Flipping the LCD to selfie position and the lens at 15mm, I can shoot a group selfie easily. In the same way, you can shoot kids and have a great reaction as they see themselves and make funny expressions - you're shooting blind, but keeping it centered is sufficient.

Wireless transmission of photos to my phone and being able to operate it remotely is wonderful.

The battery life is sufficient. Wished there was 4K. Focusing is snappy. LCD bright. Ergonomics is very good. Button and dials feel solid. Fast FPS. Decent flash and capability to use Speedlights. Wish there was an optical viewfinder built-in. This is a hot buy. Pricey, but I can see it being in my travel bag for 6+ years."^5^Jun 13, 2017 12:49 PM

GreenFlash^/sony-alpha-a6500-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5655633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^22^3^"In my opinion, this is the best overall APS-C interchangeable lens camera available at any price. I have been using mine for just over a month. It produces outstanding images. There are many reasons why, but I want everyone to understand I am not writing this review for professionals who already know the features of the camera, but rather for beginner and intermediate photographers. These are the big things that are important to the quality of your images: 
 1. In Camera Body Image Stabilization (IBIS). Unless your hands are super steady, with 24 megapixels you will need image stabilization to get really sharp images. If you don't have IBIS, you are limited to those lenses which have in-lens image stabilization. But many small, truly outstanding prime lenses, do not have image stabilization. To name three, there is a Sony F2 28mm lens about $500, two Sony-Zeiss lenses, an APS-C F1.8 24mm and F1.8 55mm which are both outstanding. IBIS means you can shoot these lenses with this camera, hand held, and get tack sharp images. 
 2. Focus. a lot gets said about image quality, but IMHO the biggest single obstacle to shooting really good shots for every day photographers, is that the shot is a little out of focus. This camera has superb focusing. It's super quick and super accurate, so a much higher percentage of your shots are good. Not to harp on it, but if you don't get good focus on a key shot, well, it isn't going to happen again, so you just missed it. You have to learn how to use the focus settings on the camera. But when you do, wow!
 3. Fast shooting and focusing. I have not used the camera at its fastest shooting speed (more than 10 frames per second) but only at it medium speed; plenty fast for me. It shoots and refocuses keeping your shots always in focus. For my wife's hula dancing it works like a charm.
 4. Sony has a lot of video experience which translates into much more user friendly video capabilities. Sony's file formats work easily with multiple softwares, And by the way, the IBIS is really important for hand held video. For hand held, I also like that the size and weight are a lot less than the DSLR cameras. And just to mention the sensor APS-C size is the largest practical sensor size for video... and the video images and colors are imho much better than those in dedicated consumer level video cameras.
 5. I personally favor APS-C cameras over full frame for a whole bunch of reasons. Depth of field is greater...which means more of your image will be in better focus. (Many pros actually prefer that only their main subject is in focus, because other stuff in focus detracts from the main image). But most consumers want as much of their images in focus as possible. Because individual pixels are smaller than in full frame cameras, actual detail of images will be greater as long as you zoom in on your actual subject. There are also more smaller lenses that work with APS-C than with full frame cameras, so you can keep the size of camera+lens much smaller with APS-C. 
 6. There's a whole list of lesser considerations and technical reasons why I like the A6500 better than any other APS-C camera. If you are interested you can read about them elsewhere on the web. But here I have tried to stay focused on the things that will actually make a difference to your everyday image quality.
 7. Commentators complain that batteries could be larger and that Sony menus are not to their liking. The camera has touch screen, but they complain, only limited functions...on and on. But the truth is, all but the most demanding users simply develop workarounds for most of these kinds of concerns, and they are not really a factor in everyday photography.

I can use lenses without OSS now and not worry much about blurriness. The biggest con is definitely the touch screen. In short it is terrible. Come on Sony! Why put a screen that phones had in the year 2000?! Its 2017!"^4^Jan 26, 2017 11:59 AM
MinionsBassets^/sony-alpha-a6500-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5655633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"I've already snapped the shutter 11,000 times on my first Sony 6500 and have been pleased with the results most of the time (I'm more limited than the 6500 is limiting). I can compare it to a Nikon 7200, which I also use, and I find myself taking the Sony 6500 along with me most of the time. The Nikon has somewhat better focusing under low light circumstances, but the Sony does much better at nailing the focus for objects within 3 feet of the camera, since I don't need to worry about micro focus adjustment of each lens. The Sony has much better video and generally does as well with still images. Manual focusing is a pure joy with the EVF magnification. From a personal preference I would much rather have the 6500's light weight and small size compared to the Nikon 7200. Three other things stand out on the Sony 6500: in camera stabilization, a generous sized buffer, and works well with a wide array of manual focusing lenses.

The cons of the 6500 for me: the focusing is not as good and precise as the Sony A7Riii; the writing to the memory card is too slow; RAW files are compressed (not always a big deal, but no option to have uncompressed RAW); Sony lenses' prices are comparatively higher than Canon and Nikon lenses."^5^Jun 8, 2018 9:42 PM

RENATO^/sony-alpha-a6500-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5655633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"Am comparing with the Sony Nex-7, of which I own 3 bodies. I dismiss DSLR cameras as inappropriate for my purposes. Film SLRs and DSLRs are too bulky and weighty, even APS-sensor DSLRs, to be carried when photography is not my sole purpose of travel and recreation. Despite all the SLRs and DSLRs I have owned, most of my photography was with upper end point and shoots. Your best camera is the one you have with you. A camera too burdensome stays home. Professional grade mirrorless cameras have provided pleasure of full control in totable size. I purchased the a6500 for its weather sealing. Recently while traveling in deserts and in wet maritime climate the lack of sealing in the Nex-7 proved a liability. Many will buy the a6500 for its astounding auto focus, shooting speed and buffer size, fine features, though for me not sufficient to justify purchase. E-mount APS size lenses are not weather sealed, but a single wrap of a 1/4 wide strip of gaffer's tape applied over the lens mount gives good protection. (I do recommend a rain sleeve, as well, when needed.) In body image stabilization is a plus when hand holding in low light with wonderful but unstabilized Zeiss 24/1.8 and 50/2.8 macro. Vs. the Nex-7 handling is improved. Stray hand and body contact no longer moves the top control wheels nor is the movie button as likely to be inadvertently activated. Custom and function buttons allow command of exposure parameters, ISO, focus mode, exposure mode, exposure compensation, flash compensation, exposure bracketing, and viewing of histogram and of electronic level, all without removing eye from EVF. Nex-7 was excellent, but a6500 is even better. Menu navigation is improved. Solid feel. It is a lot of fun to use. So far have failed in attempt to link to iPhone but this level of remote control is a stunt I'd only use for long exposure on tripod, controlling focus point, shutter and exposure from phone screen. Eventually will succeed."^5^Sep 1, 2018 11:53 AM

The ruggedness of the camera body has been improved and the photos are slightly better than those produced by the a6000. Overall I am pleased with this camera. For anyone considering updating from an a6000 that is working well, I would recommend waiting for the price to drop on this model or a new model is introduced. The slight improvements in performance and features are not worth the price."^4^May 13, 2017 3:44 PM

mesolo^/sony-alpha-a6500-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5655633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Let me first start off by saying I've owned my A6500 for 5 months now and I'm just now starting to understand how to use it.  With that said, I can honestly say (I now) love it!  This is my first mirrorless that wasn't a point and shoot so that required a steep learning curve.  So that meant I had to learn about aperture, shutter speed, ISO and all the different lenses that come with it, not to mention the equipment.  At first I was so overwhelmed by the amount of time and energy I was putting into learning how to use it I seriously considered returning it.  But what stopped me was the great results I was getting (and continue to get) once I started to get the hang of it, and this was only after pouring through several photography books, including Bryan Peterson's, YouTube videos and talking to other photographers that it all started to make sense.  What makes it truly worthwhile for me is when my pictures look almost professional grade, which is a very real possibility with this camera.  Another thing I love about the A6500 is it's perfect for shooting at night when I have the aperture set wide to 1.8, using either my Sony 35mm or 85mm lenses, which I also highly recommend.  Totally worth it! Now I'm starting to add-on new equipment, like a recently purchased Manfrotto tripod and a Sony remote control which both really cut down on camera shake and the blurriness I used to get in my pictures.  Another must-have!  Pictures turn out almost perfect with these two additional accessories.  I'm now dabbling in light photography, long exposures and panoramas which I want to explore more of on my next vacation.  In parting, if you're looking to explore all the possibilities of a mirrorless camera, step up to the A6500 for some blow your mind photographs.  You won't regret it!"^5^Sep 24, 2019 1:48 PM

It was rainy off and on in Juneau & the weather protectant sealing really protected the camera.

The lens mount is snug and precise as well as the feel of the switches. The weight of the camera is a little more than the a6000; but, it feels more durable. The color balance of the image out of the camera is more accurate than the a6000. It goes without saying that the image stabilization in the camera is the frosting on the cake. Now the Zeiss 55mm F1.8, Zeiss 24mm F1.8 and the Sony 50mm f2.8 lenses all benefit from stabilization. Thanks to Sony and Best Buy for a worthwhile upgrade."^5^May 29, 2018 4:07 PM
NotSoNoob^/sony-alpha-a6500-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5655633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"There really isnt another camera that compares with the A6500. I have seen comparisons between this camera and the Canon 80 D, but that isnt fair to Canon. The A 6500 is superior to every Canon, Nikon or Panisonic camera that has an APS-C or Micro 4/3rds sensor. The advantage starts with 4K video, in body image stabilization and one of the best auto focus systems available. All of this in the smallest interchangeable lens body that makes it super handy to take anywhere with you. This is a true hybrid system and while some cameras might compete in the photography arena, none give you the best of both video and photography. 
There are a few areas that Sony can improve and these are areas that other big names like Canon and Nikon have the edge. The biggest downer is battery life. While Sony has developed better batteries for the full frame cameras, the A6500 still uses the smaller battery. This was not a deal breaker for me. I just got extra batteries and Keep on shooting. The lens selection is still limited compared to Nikon and Canon. However, this is improving and I have never been in a position in which there was not a lens that would do what I wanted. Finally, there are better menu systems. You might try an A6000 if you are new to SLR cameras. I have one of those as well and after a year of use, I felt comfortable stepping up into the A6500. It is a big jump. 
Some other highlights of the A6500 is the ability to record at 120 frames per second so that you get buttery smooth slo-mo. You also have access to an App Store to get additional functions added. The A6500 has WiFi and Bluetooth so you can remotely connect to your phone to wirelessly control, upload photos and video or use as a monitor. The A6500 has a high speed shutter speed of 11 frames per second for action photography and a huge buffer so that you can just keep churning out the shots. Thats another feature that most other cameras reserve for there higher end full frame models if they can shoot at that speed. 
Happy shooting!"^5^Dec 30, 2017 12:12 AM

That meant countless hours watching reviews, reading reviews on here, looking up guides, and so on. I came to the conclusion that this one was the one for me. The selling points for me were the small form factor, the evf, and steadyshot. The evf was a big deal to me as it would let me see what my shot would look like in real time and it shows a lot of information on there as well. Steadyshot was necessary as I wanted to make videos and I didn't want shaky videos so I went with something that had optical image stabilization. Lastly the small form factor makes it easy to take anywhere. The only downside that I could think of for getting this camera is that you would have to invest in the lenses. They are not cheap by any means. So if you want this camera you have to have a good amount set apart for lenses as well since they will always work better than cannon or Nikon lenses with an adapter. That being said it's an excellent camera and the lenses are some of the sharpest I have seen for both video and photography so I would say it is worth it. If you are debating whether to buy it or not, I would say to go for it as it's one of the best value cameras on the market right now."^5^Jul 23, 2017 1:07 PM
RLW2017^/sony-alpha-a6500-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5655633?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The Sony A6500 is a nice camera for the consumer from beginner to enthusiast. I spent time researching before purchasing and several major reviews listed it as a good choice. The camera has excellent photo quality and video quality as well, a strong comprehensive package. The trio of Sony Alpha 6000s share most features; however. The model differences are important to operation. The 6500 has the same rating on its photo quality as the 6300 as they share the updated copper designed innards given them the one-up on the previous models. The other difference is that video is better on the A6500 as Sony seems to have gotten the Video to no longer have a time limit before thermal shutdown. Something you read a bit on with regard to the previous models. The camera is an APS-C sensor design which classifies it in most circles as a non-professional camera due to its ability in lower light settings over that of a full-frame but there are other considerations- price and lens price specifically, that make the APS-C a great choice for all but those perhaps with photography as a career. I recommend this camera to those who want a smaller platform to take photos and videos that are really good but don't want to break the bank getting a nice camera."^5^Jun 30, 2017 8:05 PM

The camera is small and lightweight, but feature-rich. There are so many features and operating modes that it can be overwhelming if you are looking for just the one. I recommend starting with what you know (full auto if you are new to photography) and then take time each week to learn at least one new features.

HelloMikee^/sony-alpha-a9-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5865600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^24^3^"-- SUMMARY --

While the Sony a9 is marketed hard towards sports photographers, I find that FPS aside, the added features, upgrades and improvements the Sony a9 offers over the a7 series makes it a workhorse of a camera to suit a variety of photographers needs. Workhorse is a term used mostly for robust DSLR's and something you never really associated with a mirrorless system. All that changes with the Sony a9. It's most definitely capable of handling almost any photography assignment.

-- BUILD & CAMERA CONTROLS --

The build quality of the body of the a9 feels very much like the a7R II with an unnoticeable gain in weight and grip size. With that said, thats pretty much where the similarity ends. Everything else feels more robust in the hands, Im assuming that has a lot to do with upgrading the buttons and dials which feel much more substantial and tactile.

The back dial is much more firm so you wont be accidentally turning the wheel when shooting. I do wish the dial was a bit bigger because now that its more robust, it does take a tiny bit of effort to turn and when its that small, it isnt necessarily the easiest. Of course, thats a minor complaint because in use, its totally fine.

The buttons themselves arent as recessed as they are on the a7R II making them feel more clickable. Its funny how such small details can really elevate a product to a more premium level. I never thought the buttons on the a7R II felt toy like, but as I go back and forth, the difference is undeniable.

-- UI & OPERATION SPEED --

The a9 takes on Sonys new menu UI. Like Ive said before, I never really had issues with the organization of the older menus. Theyre ugly but that was about all I thought about them. That thought process has chanced now that I have a camera like the a9, where it is so feature-packed, a good menu really is key. Add to that the ability to pretty much custom assign all the buttons, the quick access menu and the customizable My Menu configuration, you are absolutely covered in terms of finding key functions quickly.

One of the few things I hated about the a7R II is how slow and unresponsive the camera can sometimes be. I rely a lot on photo review and zoom to make sure peoples eyes are open. For large important group portraits during a wedding, I want to make sure all eyes are open and reviewing that on the a7R II is painfully slow. The a9 is now almost instant when reviewing and really fast when zooming in.

The screen on the back LCD, while only gaining a little bump in resolution, looks more clear and crisp than it does on the a7R II. You notice it when looking at the menu. It could be also because the menu in the a7R II is the older style UI, but still, the a9 looks more crisp and clear overall. Where there is a big difference however is the EVF. Its much more clear and crisp. Its not even that the a7R II has a bad EVF, its just the a9 is better.

-- DUAL CARD SLOTS, THE JOYSTICK and NEW DIALS --

Yes! Dual slots! I have never had a memory card go bad on me, but I have heard countless stories of other photographers loosing images or paying for a third party to recover them, some even with just no luck. Just because it hasnt happened to me doesnt mean I dont often think about it during a shoot. Thankfully, my mind is more at easy and Im able to have a backup card. Ive also run into companies that wouldnt hire me unless I was using a camera with dual slots.

The only gripe I have with the dual slots is the set up. For something like shooting Raw to slot 1 (faster slot) and JPEG to slot 2, its a bit confusing as you have to set the record media to slot 2 in order for the JPEGs to be stored there. Yea its weird and seems backwards. One of the only times Ive ever actually had to read a camera manual.

The new dial on the top left is a nice addition. Allowing for quick access to drive modes and AF modes. I do wish the locking button for that dial had an on and off switch. It would be nice to change those on the fly without first pressing in a button.

And finally! The joystick! Why it took them so long to add an AF joystick is besides me. I, along with many other photographers, find that a joystick is the fasted and most convenient way to change your AF point while composing your shots.

-- IMAGE QUALITY --

But it doesnt have the resolution and dynamic range of the a7R II Is what I kept telling myself to keep me from investing in the a9. Its also what a lot of people are saying in reviews and forum posts and probably for the same reason. But in all honestly, aside from the dimensions of the file itself, its pretty hard to distinguish an a7R II file vs an a9 file unless you zoom in at 100%. But honestly, I sometimes cant even tell when Im working with an a6500 file.

So if you have those reservations, you can put them to rest. The resolution is just fine and the dynamic range is plentiful. You can also be assured that the a9s high ISO is really good. Some of the wedding images below show how it tough lighting (backlit, combination of harsh light and shadows, mix lighting, etc.), the a9 is capable of producing fantastic results with a lot of room to push and pull shadows and highlights.

-- VIDEO QUALITY --

I am a super amateur videographer so I wont go in depth about the quality or lack of S-Log. What I have read is that apparently the a9 downsamples 6k footage to 4k which makes the quality really awesome. Theyve also heavily reduced rolling shutter during quick panning. Nice! But like I said, Im just barely starting to get into video so I definitely dont have much knowledge about this.

-- ALL THE OTHER AMAZING FEATURES --

Eye AF has been game changing for portraits and it just got better on the a9. It tracks your eye flawlessly. I mean, the ability to shoot at f/1.4 and be confident that your subjects eye will be in focus is just crazy.

I also love the fact that your AF selection changes whether youre shooting in landscape or portrait mode. This I something that is super useful when dealing with portraits.

Then theres the 20 FPS. Honestly, I dont think Ill use it much, maybe just key moments at a wedding or cool action shots while traveling. Im sure some of you are wondering why Id buy an a9 if I dont need the 20 FPS, but thats just part of why this camera is amazing. Besides, when I got the a7R II, I said I didnt need the resolution but here I am, holding onto the camera specifically for resolution.

09/05/17 Update: Wow. 20 FPS is DOPE. Yea, didnt think it would be of much use to me but being able to shoot away as the bride walks down, during a sparklers send off, or even just while theyre dancing the night away at the reception has been a much welcome addition. Having that speed allows you to get that perfect shot. Was I able to get the shot before? Yea, I think there was always at least one shot good enough. But now, its more like 10 shots to choose from which in my opinion really takes away that margin of error.

Silent shooting and no black out with the electronic shutter. Its kind of weird, but awesome! In the two weeks Ive owned the a9, Ive already gotten use to the no black out, its pretty epic. However, I still have yet to get use to silent shooting and dont think I ever will get use to it. I am excited though that I can use it during ceremonies at quiet churches and even more excited I can be super discreet while I travel. Other than that, I need the sound. Also, rolling shutter has been greatly improved when using the electronic shutter.

09/05/17 Update: I am still not use to silent shooting and I dont think Ill ever get use to it. Personally, I feel like I either need the sound or the black out. At a few weddings, I had to make sure I was taking photos by pressing the play button haha. Im sure this is great for sports and nature photographers who are in a more controlled space while shooting and need to be silent (think tennis match point!). But for weddings Im finding people are actually listening for the click to go off. There were a few awkward moments when Id put the camera to my face, theyd pose for a photo and not hear a sound and Id put the camera down. Theyd ask, Did you take a photo?

This camera of course has pretty much all the features carried down from their other cameras. Stuff like IBIS (still one of the best things ever), touch screen (I have mine off because the joystick is more than capable to change focus), 4k, S&Q (slo motion capture and play) and everything else great about the latest Sony mirrorless cameras.

-- BATTERY LIFE --

09/05/17 Update: I shot my first wedding with the a9 in 100F weather and thankfully, there was no heat warnings of sorts even though my camera was hot. Regarding battery life, I fired off over 2k shots with about 15% remaining after 7 hours. The only thing I really made sure to do was turn off the camera when not in use during those waiting periods. Amazing!

-- CONCLUSION -- 

So to conclude, the a9 is awesome. Its not just an awesome sports camera, its an awesome everything camera. I am most excited about the AF system (with the better Eye AF and joystick) as well as the battery life. I know people say, just bring extra batteries, but looking back at traveling through a place like India, I stressed over making sure I had enough charged batteries and portable battery packs and converters to last a long day of adventure and shooting. Its in those moments that I look back and it becomes annoying and cumbersome and something Id rather not have to deal.

The a9 brings back some of what DSLRs were only capable of doing. Lightning fast AF and really good battery life. Its an exciting time to be invested in mirrorless and it can only get better from here.

And two months in shooting with the a9, I can confidently say this is indeed, a game changer."^5^Sep 14, 2017 10:44 AM

I've shot Nikon for the vast majority of that time.(short time with canon). I can honestly say this is the best camera system I have ever had the pleasure to shoot with. I was expecting a couple shining points to stick out to me but after shooting 6 weddings with the gear I can't find an area where I am less than thrilled. Focus system is amazing, low light..amazing. Coming from the d5 I was a bit nervous about stepping into a small frame camera but it feels great in the hand even with the 70-200 2.8.

SoccerDad^/sony-alpha-a9-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5865600?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"Im not a professional photographer but photography has been my passion and hobby for years. The A7II was my transition camera from the smartphone/digital camera world to the DSLR/Mirrorless level of the game. It was my starter camera which I purchased at best buy on black Friday 2017 got a great deal and I've been taking pictures daily ever since. I decided to upgrade this year but was stuck between A7RIII and the A9. Im not going to go all tech talk here but the main difference between the two is 1. with the A7RIII you can take 'bigger' pictures (at 42.4 mp it captures enough information so you can print pictures big enough to hang on the side of a building!) 2. with the A9 you can take 'faster' pictures (you can basically stop time and at 20 frames per second you can select the shot with the best moment ). I went with the A9 because it can do everything the A7RIII plus more. The trade off is it has 693 point phase detection for auto focus vs 425 on the A7RIII, 20 fps vs 10 fps on A7RIII, and 24.2 mp vs 42.2 mp on the A7RIII. They both record movies at 4k but im not a video guy so i didn't read too much into the video spec. The reason I bring up the A7RIII on this review because it seems to be the topic all over the internet when people are deciding which mirror-less camera to get next. At the end of the day if you are into portrait photography - A7RIII, if you are into sports and nature photography A9. If you are rich, get both. I also went A9 because my son is into sports plus - it was on sale and i had gift cards and points saved from best buy rewards program, I basically got it at the price of the A7RIII with 24 month no interest financing on my best buy credit card. The opportunity was worth the sacrifice and budget adjustment. I don't regret it!!! I just need to save money for the FE 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 telephoto lens."^5^May 12, 2019 10:02 AM

Ive owned and shot D300, D3s, D4, D4s, D600, D750 and D810 and now D500.   The AF I. The Sony a9 is the best of all of them for action and wildlife. Especially BIF.  It has an amazing ability to track the subject even when backgrounds change or obstructions occur.  

Nikon seems to have better color rendition, but  otherwise, the focus rocks. The frames per second is incredible.   Also, there is no mirror black out which makes it very easy to track flight.   

The EVF isnt my favorite, as I prefer to see the true picture through the viewfinder.   However, the ability to see the exposure they the viewfinder is a huge plus.

Not such an big improvement if you are strictly looking for higher ISO performance over the mk i version. If this is your main consideration in upgrading from mk i to mk ii, you might not get the jump in low light /high ISO performance you are hoping for.
The increase from 16 to 20 MP helps outright resolution, but it's not a quantum leap in improvement.

Nerves^/olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-ii-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/5684901?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^8^1^"I purchased this camera in December 2017 for the holidays. I am a long time Canon user, owning several bodies and a significant collection of 'L' lenses. Suffice to say that my 1D (x)'s have taken me everywhere. Over that last years (several), I found myself just using the camera phone and not my Pro-Gear; to the point that it just sat there.

The weight, size, and other factors let me just to walk away. Fast forward 2 years ago, and a long vacation trip. I purchased the Sony (A6300) with some good lenses. Mirrorless, experience in my past was horrid but, the Sony performed well. That camera system was lighter and much smaller than my canon but, never felt a 'connection' with the system. My best description of someone it felt like a software company made a camera and not the other way around.

The Olympus E-M1 Mark II has been that camera (It doesn't solve everything) that I take most often and everywhere. It's been to a severe and long-lasting downpour in the Appalachian trail, with no protection for over 2 hours. It's been dropped on a tile in a bowling alley, it's been in freezing weather with Snow..still going without a single issue.

The Single focus is blinding fast (faster than the Sony). There's virtually no shutter lag, the creative modes (live time and live composition) changed the way I see and capture moments. Not carrying a tripod because of this mind-blowing IBIS is makes me take the camera everywhere. It's NOT a 'Night Ninja'; meaning FF (Full Frames) still have an edge on paper but, for street photography at night...it's incredible (if you like the film look like I do and hate the surgical look). Nobody notices you, so no one is possing or angry. 

For travel, the main reason I bought it...imagine carrying 5-7 lenses, camera, spare batteries, chargers, memory cards/readers, backup drive, and more on a trip...and it's less that 8LBs!!!!!! The C4K video is impressive and Capable of 237Mbits (higher resolution than the sony's), and with the IBIS it looks like you have a gimbal while walking.

No to the downside...video Continuous Autofocusing at night while tracking is not as good as the Canon or the sony...the Eye tracking is not as good as the new A7III sony. Battery life is about 488 (low- lots of 4k videos)-780 (avg with some footage) and 900-1100 (with no video). 

The primes lenses (45-75mm) none pro are genuinely amazingly sharp. The 75mm is as good at my Canon 70-200 L v2 if not better (the Bokeh)...the 12-40 F2.8 Pro is the leading workhorse...and stay's on the camera 90% of the time. I know own 14 Lenses (Olympus, Panasonic, and Laowa)...and the M4/3 (Micro Four Thirds) platform works amazingly!!! In Europe, you'll find places that you will NOT be allowed in with a typical DSLR of the Mirrorless FF (the lenses are about the same size on FF mirrorless as traditional DSLR's). In Certain Park tours in Africa the FF with command a higher 'Tax' or entrance fee. I can take and hand hold an 800mm (Panasonic Leica) zoom all day. Try walking around with an FF, 70-200 F2.8, and a 24-70 F2.8 and a wide angle (all fast glass)...tell me how you feel at the end of the day. I typically only have 1 lenses for street photography...and maybe 2 for 'Urban/city' travel (add a super wide angle)...so its not just about giving up light dominance (for pixel peepers), it's not about walking away from 14Bit color, it's not about having less dynamic range. It's a compromise and acknowledgment that my 20MP is enough for my medium and needs. I post mostly online...My audience is online, so I'm deliberate on the use case and in that the Olympus ROCKS!

I like the design, compact size, and quality of construction. I have several lenses - two of the Pro series zooms (12-40mm f2.8 and 40-150mm f2.8), a 60mm f2.8 macro, and a 17mm f1.8. The E-M1 has lots of features, and I'm still learning them all, but so far it's been a great camera."^5^Jun 24, 2017 6:48 AM

Just like my EM10.2, I can look through the EVF on the bright sunny days and pull the focus box on the back panel. There are more buttons with more functions that can be assigned without without fumbling around the Super Control Panel (SCP) or menu. 
I can hit the HDR button while in any PASM mode and scroll through the modes without the SCP or menu. I can do a white balance with one touch. I owned the camera for a month and have not thought of what function to button reconfiguration yet. 
There are enough functions and reconfigurable buttons for run and shoot photography without fumbling around. When you need the SCP, just duck into a shady spot or reconfigure a button to run and shoot."^5^Feb 4, 2019 6:15 PM

I shoot photos and videos professionally and was interested in the smaller, more compact, mirrorless body for smaller projects. This canon M5 sure does the trick. Shoots 1080 video at 60 fps and takes high quality RAW format photos with great colors. It takes a little getting used to, coming from a full size Canon body, but once you read the manual and get an hour or two of hands on experience, it's like I've been using it all my life."^5^Oct 28, 2017 1:18 AM
PolarTheCameraGuy^/canon-eos-m5-mirrorless-camera-with-ef-m-18-150mm-telephoto-zoom-lens-black/5623278?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^2^"I originally came looking for the M5 as the perfect Vlogger camera, along with the occasional B roll and video shots I need to get from time to time. The Internal Stabilization is great for video and does everything I expected it to, which makes editing a breeze later. Video quality is also really good. But one thing i wasn't expecting was for the I.S. to be SO good that I can shoot at shutter speeds blow 1/3 of a second hand held and still get a sharp Image! What?! its great, not that you need that all the time but just think of all the epic stills you can get hand held at lower ISO's now.

as for Cons: ISO performance is ok. Nothing close to current DSLR's like my Nikon D750, but still ok. the sensor is APS-C and its mirrorless so that tends to be the standard honestly. Just know that you will start getting some noticable noise around 6400 ISO (but still usable depending on your taste) If you are a perfectionist, then its not for you.
The focusing system is great, but again coming from DSLR's it could be more accurate, and it could be faster. Continuous focus in still shooting is iffy and can sort of miss and overcompensate alot. On video however its pretty spot on and shifts focus SUPER smoothly.
and lastly. I hate the multi page menu system. Id rather just scroll down through all related options in one tab rather than have 4 tabs just for camera settings that i need to scroll through sideways, along with all the other tabs.

Final thoughts: Great video camera, for Short takes, B-roll, and Vlogging thanks to that flip down screen that makes you look like you are always looking at your audience. Could be better focus, and noise performance wise, and with a neater menu but if you can get past that, its a great little camera for when you don't want to lug around the heavy beasts that DSLR's tend to be."^4^Jun 24, 2017 11:04 PM

Best option: mirrorless. There are several good, really good cameras out there and was on the fence between this M5 or the A6500 Sony. Ultimately I chose the Canon and am really glad I did. I am not trying to be bias but my Canon use goes back to the A-1,F-1 days and the Mark5s. I literally was in Best Buy for 2 hours making my choice. Granted Sony has more lens offerings for their A series, however the Canon EF-M 18-150 cover all your needs for a single lens, small, robust built high quality camera for travel such as the M5. Keep in mind with an adapter I can use all my EF series lenses. Many people purchase bridge cameras, my advice is dont unless you must spend less than $500. If however you can go to $1000 get this M5, now replaced by the M50. I picked the older more expensive M5 over the M50. Here is what will happen, you spend $450 on a bridge camera, 3 months later you want more quality and go the correct way, mirrorless. To sum it up this is a high quality camera that will not leave you with buyers remorse. Great point and shoot or full manual and great video with exteral mic jack, etc...."^5^Apr 12, 2019 8:08 PM

It is light weight for such a powerful camera. It will serve the needs of a hobbyist, and I feel a professional photographer would like it as a take along camera for many situations. I especially like the touch screen. The lens in easy to put on and take off. The only negative for me, which is not enough to not give it a 5 star rating, is that the dials on the left require the user to push in the center to allow the dial to turn. I am right handed, and for me the left side and pushing down and turning is awkward. I have not found a way to do it quickly."^5^Dec 9, 2017 11:48 AM

First of all, if you're thinking of getting this camera for video, forget it. It's only HD resolution and the LCD screen flips down, which is just awful for anyone using this on a tripod.

So, this is strictly a photography camera. Even then, Canon's M series of lenses is kind of a joke, so plan on getting the EF/EF-S lens adapter for about $150, so that you can use some higher end lenses.

But the reason this camera works for me: I'm only interested in photography. I wanted a compact lens that I could take with an EF-M lens while traveling, and then also pair up with a bigger, higher-end lens when convenient.

I got a bit of a ribbing when I bought this lens and Canon released their M50 less than a month later. But compared to the M50, I'm glad I have this camera. It's got more physical dials than the M50, which needs to be adjusted primarily via the touchscreen, and even though the M50 has 4K video, it's crippled. I think I'll be keeping this camera for a long while."^5^Oct 28, 2018 2:33 AM
