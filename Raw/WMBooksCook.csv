Elisabeth424, ^55833574^12^3^"You can't go wrong when you purchase a PW cookbook. I've been a fan since her first one came out. And I was thrilled when this cookbook came out. It's for those of use who have crazy lives only have a short time to answer the question 'what's for dinner?'

All of her cookbooks are colorful, beautiful and easy to lose yourself in. Yes in a cookbook. 

Only issue is they do not stay open to the page when your using it in the kitchen. Also the table of contents should have the recipe listing in the front. This one and the others list for each section. So if there was one thing to work on it would be how the book opens and the other would be it's table of contents page."^4^December 10, 2017

bubba123456, ^55833574^2^0^"Fantastic recipe book!   Can never go wrong with Pioneer Woman.  item was received in secure packaging and arrived very fast and was undamaged.  Recipes are fantastic.  All easy to follow with no super fancy ingredients needed.  Nearly everything needed you would already have on hand so  no special trips to the grocery store.

CJohnson, ^52612512^9^2^"Enjoyed making the salmon croquet recipe first, but ,there are so many others just as good.

FMD2014, ^24179987^12^0^"I have had the FMD book for over 4 months. I read it. Enjoyed it. But just couldn't put the whole idea together to make it simple. The Cookbook really helps with what to eat during each Phase. The
book is designed in Phases and each Phase has a section for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...even desserts, drinks, sides and dips. Not every recipe is for everybody! Nice assortment and some recipes seem like you could change the cooking method if you don't want to use a slow-cooker. One of my favorite recipes: the 'Garden Meatballs' for all phases. I have been doing the FMD for over a week and I haven't been perfect and I am showing results ...I'm amazed! I purchased the Cookbook via Walmart.com because the price was the best and I could have it delivered to the store without being charged a shipping fee. Nice easy pickup and I was on my way."^5^September 30, 2014
MrsJackieG, ^24179987^11^0^"I didn't read the first book 'The Fast Metabolism Diet' but this book has all the important information. So far I have lost 12lbs with it. I feel so much healthier than before I started the diet. I sleep better and have so much energy to work out."^5^March 14, 2014
teach4life, ^24179987^8^0^"Just started this diet and I am eating more than I have been allowed on any other diet. I am only 5 days into it and I have lost 2.5 pounds! I do miss my chocolate, my caffeine, and my dairy, but I am feeling healthier with each passing day. This is really not a diet--it is a new way to eat forever."^5^July 14, 2015
PragmaticRon, ^24179987^5^0^"A big disappointment! There are too many recipes requiring too many 'impossible' to purchase locally ingredients. Don't waste your money on this. Instead, take a look at Fast Metabolism Diet book (not the cookbook) where recipes included are more realistic."^1^January 5, 2015
Maska, ^24179987^5^2^"This is the follow up book to' The fast Metabolism Diet' that has all new recipes

sargeret, ^50720513^63^13^"I purchased the LATEST MODEL Electric Instant Pot IP-DUO60-ENW Stainless Steel 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker from Walmart and then began the search for a cookbook after reading reviews that said the cookbook that came with the pot was lacking.

I preordered this cookbook from Walmart. I am not sure that it is that much of an improvement over the prior edition, although I have not seen it.

I do know that I have had to go on the internet to find recipes for boiled eggs, etc., simple things that should have been in the cookbook.

It's okay. I'm sure I will eventually try some of the recipes, but I wish it had some of the standard stove top pressure cooker recipes and adapted them for the electric pot.
Pinterest and many websites are very helpful for finding information and getting recipes you can use."^3^April 13, 2016
pick1000, ^50720513^37^5^"The cookbook has a lot of recipes that a person who seldom cooks can handle. The ingredients are few and mostly simple ones and the same can be said for the steps. There were a couple ingredients that I had to goggle but I found at Wal-Mart. The steps in recipes are pretty easy even for a beginner. It states the prep.. cook and pressure release times. Also has calories, carbs, and  etc.   It has different recipes for any food preferences. I am very happy with the book and it is great for those who have never use a pressure cooker or an electric pressure cooker."^5^December 28, 2016
MountainMama23, ^50720513^36^8^"It covers basic everyday information for new users of the instant pot as well as a ton of recipes that use everyday ingredients that you probably have on hand, and for the end result to be well seasoned foods."^5^August 11, 2016
BCFL, ^50720513^31^4^"I grew up learning to cook in a 'from scratch' kitchen, so, I'm not recipe dependent. But - the Instant Pot is an appliance that requires a bit of a direction and this recipe book more than fills the bill. It provides basic recipes to use as guidelines for your own favorite dishes and adds a good selection of recipes that cover the various meats, veggies, etc. Even some desserts. Well worth the price."^5^February 1, 2017

Disappointed, ^50720513^10^1^"Since I'm a beginner, using an electric pressure cooker, this book provides the essentials as well as some good recipes. I cook low calorie so I have to convert most of the recipes to suit our diet and my family recipes."^4^February 9, 2017
AB11, ^50720513^10^6^"I bought this to use with an Instant Pot. We apparently have different meanings for not fuss cooking. I want recipes where I can pour things in the pot and let it do its thing, not try to prepare a bunch of gourmet meals with items I don't keep on hand."^1^May 7, 2017
assayer, ^50720513^7^0^"some of the recipies I would not try due to my personal tastes.  I have tried 1 that I slightly modified from a pork roast to pork chops that turned out very good."^4^February 18, 2017

SnickersLacey, ^23369205^17^5^"The Pioneer Woman Cooks: A Year of Holidays: 140 Step-By-Step Recipes of Ree's family celebration recipes and the beautiful photos of the step-by-step preparations are wonderful....
Just Fantastic!
I have never been so impressed by a cookbook before like this one of Ree's. It's wonderful reading about herself and her family. We are so blessed by Ree's talents and the willingness to share her talents with us thru her cookbooks and thru her TV cooking show. Never miss any of Ree's cooking shows.... :)
I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone but especially for beginning cooks. The recipes are easy to make along with step-by-step photos of the preparations of the recipes. A novice cook can't miss making a good final product. :)

Thank You Walmart.com for the excellent prices on all Ree's cookbooks and the fast free delivery. I did my Black Friday shopping on the Monday before Thanksgiving and received the cookbooks by Wednesday of the same week. Can't beat that plus I never had to leave home! Thank You Walmart.

MamaDuke09, ^10986750^54^6^"I like this cookbook because it is real food. . .not super fancy with ingredients that are hard to find. And I like how Pioneer Woman weaves the story of her family and life on the ranch into her recipes. Plus she is an incredible photographer and the cookbook provides step-by-step photos to go along with the recipes. She does the same thing on her blog but I think it may be easier to read in a book rather than on a website."^5^October 28, 2009
BPLKWW, ^10986750^36^1^"This book shouldn't be called a plain cookbook. Yes, it contains great recipes (many containing plenty of butter; if you are looking for low-fat, low-calorie dishes the pickings will be slim). There are not hundreds of recipes but a decent variety, and each has step by step instructions that will give even an inexperienced cook the confidence to try these recipes. What sets this cookbook apart is the author's folksy, goofy, good-natured humor; beautifully photographed color photos of every recipe and many photos of the preparation instructions; and glimpses into an Oklahoma rancher's life that makes you feel like you're part of the family, or at least a ranch hand. It's a fun read that will leave you hungry (literally!) for more."^5^December 2, 2011
savedmomaT, ^10986750^34^4^"I already love reading Ree's blog everyday, so it didn't surprise me when I fell in love with her cookbook. I love it and want 25 more to share. Her step-by-step recipes are easy to follow and are REALLY good. THANK YOU PIONEER WOMAN!"^5^October 28, 2009
Gunga2, ^10986750^32^5^"I bought this as a gift for my Mother-In-Law. She has recently become a fan of Pioneer Woman and is always talking about wanting to try some of her recipes. The price is much more reasonable through Walmart than at some of the big bookstores. The reason I say it is especially good for new fans is because it contains a nice introduction which tells how she met her husband and includes pictures of her family, the ranch, and some of the animals. However it would be a nice cookbook for long time fans as well. There are recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and appetizers with step by step illustrations to help you along. Recipes as simple as Guacamole on up to Creme' Brulee' but nothing that seems to require lots of expensive or hard to find ingredients. Plenty of comfort foods like pot roast, meatballs, pizza, sugar cookies, beans and cornbread, salads and so forth. This would make a nice wedding shower gift too."^4^May 9, 2014
jUjujudy, ^10986750^23^8^"The Pioneer Woman Cookbook is a delight. I especially enjoyed the pictures along with the recipes...really nice food photography.

She includes photos that she took. I love PW!! Walmart delivered this to my house faster than expected!! I would cook from this cookbook more but most of the recipes are no low calorie or low carb. So I probably use it about once every week or two now."^5^April 6, 2010
Banananana117, ^10986750^14^0^"I LOVE the Pioneer Women and all of her recipes. All of her recipes come with stories and lots of pictures about her family and the different things she does.

shwgebg, ^10986750^11^0^"I waited impatiently for this cookbook to arrive and was not disappointed! Fans of the PW's blog will love this cookbook. The photography is lovely and the recipes are well thought out and simple to follow. Even my own rancher husband was paging through looking longingly at 'Cowboy' food. I was happy to see that some favorite recipes like 'Edna Mae's Sour Cream Pancakes' were included in this cookbook as well as unfamiliar recipes. Well worth the already reasonable price point. Love it!"^5^June 2, 2013

I did not break any of the spines to look in depth at everything in these books, but they are really pretty. The photos are nice. The text isn't too small. There's a good weight to these books. The covers/dust jackets are very nice, lovely colors. I'm really pleased with my purchase and I am truly hoping that my sister gets a lot of use out of them -- she LOVES Ree Drummond."^5^December 6, 2016

Great recipes for everyone. I scale them down since there are just two of us and it is very easy to do or freeze part of it.

Danghanna, ^231680838^12^4^"Very disappointed with this book. You would expect buzzfeed to flood the recipe pages with “Tasty” images of the foods they're giving instructions on. Unfortunately not the case. Some pages have pictures and cleverly formatted back drops of the foods. Others are literally blank white spaces with minimal effort on even the font size of the recipe so there's giant blank spaces on a bunch of recipe pages. Still giving this gift because it's not even worth refunding. Very inconsistent format and design wise."^2^December 16, 2017
CuteEverythingcom, ^231680838^2^1^"Have you noticed those amazing delicious, super-short cooking videos online? Me, too. They're great, although finding them when I am ready to cook is less than super-convenient. So this book series is quite helpful and quite brilliant.

This particular book, Tasty Latest and Greatest, is a bit random, as it covers a wide range of recipes they've developed recently, although the overarching theme — doable, fun-to-make, and flavorful recipes — runs throughout.

Along those lines, describing the kinds of recipes in each chapter, or even what the chapter heading means, is a little difficult to sum-up. So, here are a couple examples of the recipes, from each of the chapters, that we've enjoyed and would especially recommend:

Party – Chicken Satay Skewers, Jalapeno Popper Dip (So good!)
Country Fare – Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, Mexican-style Pork Tacos (family favorite)
Sweet – Giant Cinnamon Roll, Strawberry Cheesecake Macarons (some recipes are easier than others)
Classic – One Skillet Chicken Pot Pie, Slow Cooker Beef Stew (easy and convenient)
Vegetarian – Bakes Ratatouille, Peanut Noodle Pasta Salad (yum! love Thai foods!)
Best Ever – Softest Sugar Cookies Ever, Cheesiest Garlic Bread Ever (they're not kidding)
Around the World – Chicken Tikka Masala, Sticky Pineapple Chicken (DH favorite!)
On Trend – Southwestern Sweet Potato Toast, Zucchini-noodle Chicken Alfredo (OMG)
Bombs & Rings – Cheeseburger Pretzel Bombs, Cheesecake-stuffed Banana Bread Ring (surprising and so good!)
As you can see, the book includes a wide range of dishes yet they are all really delicious for the flavors people like us are looking for today.

The book itself is well-bound, designed nicely, and the recipes are very well-written — clear and engaging. It would make a great gift for beginning-to-experienced cooks, too!"^5^February 28, 2018
KCTexas, ^44881883^32^3^"The good:
1. The recipes are exactly what you expect. Doable, delicious, and full of a variety of favors.
2. Great step-by-step pictures.
3. Easy to find ingredients.
4. Easy to follow instructions.
5. Much like the webpage, humorous and light.
The bad.
1. The book itself is of poor quality. The pages are falling away from the binding. I went to WalMart to return my copy, only to find that they are all having the same problem.
2. The book doesn't lay open flat on the counter, because of the type of binding used. When I open it to a recipe, depending on where in the book it is and where in relation to a weak spot, it may not stay open to that page without being weighted.

Overall, I like the cookbook. If it were just about the recipes, I would give it 5 stars, but I need it to be easily usable and more durable."^3^January 1, 2016

I originally purchased the book for my daughter and before I gave it to her I looked through it and decided I wanted one for myself too. All meals are everyday foods that satisfy the need for a warm comforting meal. I even tried her beef strogonoff which I make all the time but with different ingredients and enjoyed hers better. Her foods are down home everyday meals that can be easily made. This will be one of the books I buy every new bride. Thanks Ree!"^5^January 20, 2016

Chaz, ^19718940^3^0^"This book is distinct in its approach to how to bake artisan bread, since it is written by an ex-Silcon Valley software engineer. The path to EXCELLENT bread is as well designed and written in this book as a fine computer program. You can follow it time and time again to get a satisfactory result.

My first bake was 'very good', not excellent, but very good. Since then, I have baked excellent batches, as well as not-so-good batches, as I experimented with temperatures, timing, technique and methods. When I follow Ken Folkish's instructions carefully, I almost always get 'very good' or better, mindful of the bread maker's twin variables, time and temperature.

CAUTION: to make the bread in this book, you will need at least one dutch oven. Otherwise, it doesn't work. Helpful are the plastic containers recommended and proofing baskets. I recommend the Lodge 4.5 quart enameled cast-iron dutch oven, or any good 4 quart capacity dutch oven. All the recipes in the book are geared to two loaves, so I find it helpful to have two dutch ovens to bake the loaves at the same time.

I strongly recommend this book for those who like crusty, hearty, and open-form/light artisan breads and who value a precise, near fool-proof approach to getting it."^5^December 18, 2015

Lots of variety, tells you how many it will feed and what size slow cooker you need. how long on low it will take to be done and on high too. Give different choices of things to replace in the recipe. I just wish they gave the carbs,fat,calories,salt and etc on each recipe, like in the diabetic slow cooker. People need this information on any thing they make. Whether they have heart problems,or a diabetic or no health problems.

What I was not happy with was the way I recieved the book. The paper cover was torn half way down the front and it had slightly torn the actual cover of the book. The box itself that is was packed in had no damage, so it was already damaged when they put the book in the box. I did not want to deal with returning the product and ordering a new product so I repaired what I could of it myself. I threw the paper cover away and glued the book where is was torn on the actual cover to repair it. It really made me not want to order any more books from walmart.com because it should not have arrived at my house in that condition. That is why I scored it lower on the stars. The product itself is wonderful. Just not happy with it being damaged."^1^May 3, 2011

Georgia Boiled Peanuts is a stand food.
Using the saute function to make lentils.
Using Instapot trivet to cook chicken and even BBQ it.
Steaming lettuce for making wraps.
Steaming Asparagus. I havent tried that before.
The pictures of the finished dishes also show all the ingredients placed in an artistic manner on another accompanying board which almost makes it alternate presentation and choice to the eaters.

Freesocial2011, ^49289180^1^0^"If you are trying to start your year off healthier and like smoothies, Healthy Smoothie Recipe Book: Easy Mix-and-Match Smoothie Recipes for a Healthier You is a good book for you to check out.

Healthy Smoothie Recipe Book is 183 pages of guidance and recipes to help you out with your goals, or just give you some new ideas. There are 11 different categories in the book, separating smoothie recipes into which would be best to fix that ailment. There is even a detox and cleanse section.

I will admit, there are a GOOD amount of smoothies in this book that I am not sure I would ever make for myself, but if I really want to go healthy with smoothies, this is the best book to help me with that. For me, Tropical kiwi pineapple sounds like the best one in the book that I may have to make. This recipe, along with the others, includes very simple, minimal ingredients to make these quick and easy.

Looking for a sweet, relaxing smoothie? Peppermint Patty!

Each recipe includes the calories and other nutritional breakdown to help you keep track. I was very impressed with this book and all the different drinks I could make. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion"^5^February 12, 2016

There are recipes from around the world, like Hawaiian style shortribs, ropa vieja from Cuba and Ethiopian chicken stew – all delicious and family favorites now.
There are unexpected recipes liked poached salmon which I hadn’t realized I could cook in a crockpot, but it turned out very moist. There’s also pasta dishes, like Pasta e Fagioli, which is nice to be able to cook in the slow cooker. As I expected from Martha Stewart, the layout is clear and modern, while the photos of the food are gorgeous and plentiful."^5^September 6, 2017

Smairae, ^19603456^3^0^"This cookbook is GREAT! I love that it has two different types of recipes for many of the dishes: medieval AND modern. That way you can choose to keep it simple and rustic to get the real feel of medieval cooking, or you can go for the modern version which has more ingredients added to give the dishes more depth. So far I've made the Honeyed Chicken and the Breakfast in Winterfell dishes, as well as a couple of dessert dishes. They were very easy to make and absolutely delicious! You won't regret this purchase. :-) I've included a photo of the Honeyed Chicken that I made, I apologize for not putting it on a serving dish first."^5^March 14, 2013

claybelle, ^40972464^3^1^"I think this book is best used as a starter and reference book rather than a diet book. It is very well laid out, has helpful information about eating healthy, and helps you think creatively about your food. I think if you follow it exactly, you would lose weight but it would be just a matter of eating, not necessarily enjoying it or feeling satisfied. There is plenty of food to choose from, but if you don't like salad, there are lots and lots of salads. Pasta is a no-no so she suggests substitutes such as Tofu 'noodles' and spaghetti squash. I tried but just couldn't stomach those! Some of the recipes are good but many of them are just edible. My husband refused to eat my healthy meals after trying the Fiber One crusted chicken. Also, she is anti-salt, and I found that I had to add salt to just about everything in order to eat it (and I'm not big on salt). I haven't put this book away because it is a good reference and heads me in the right direction but don't expect it to be life changing."^3^February 7, 2015

The only problem I had is that you eat a lot of food and there is a lot of prep. You can prep some food ahead of time, but it is a lot. As far as diets go, you eat a lot so it nothing to help you get used to portion control.

It fulfilled my expectation regarding good southern recipes. They were excellent and varied. But I heard Paula Deen say that her hope was that this would become the new Betty Crocker cookbook for this generation... not happening. I bought this cookbook thinking that my newly married daughter wouldn't need an additional cookbook for basics. That didn't happen. Many old standbys and classics weren't included in her cookbook. If you are wanting a 'Southern Cooking' cookbook, this fits the bill. If you are hopeing for more, it falls short."^4^December 6, 2011

NewJerseyRose, ^16499052^4^5^"This book makes a good case for plant-based living. At the end of the day,though, its
questionable whether it's desirable, or possible, to change ones lifestyle so totally. I think it is telling that although we should conceivably be able to get all our nutrition from our food, the book makes an exception for B-12, and recommends supplementation. Does that not beg the whole
question? Also, it does not address the depletion of our soils, which makes the reality of getting all our nutrion from plants questionable. The book is thought-provoking, and I think it does make the case for increasing our plant-based intake, and reducing our animal food sources."^3^July 13, 2013

All of the cookie recipes require very little fuss. The majority of the recipes require a minimum of ingredients and a minimum of work. There is a picture of each cookie to let you know what to expect and with very little effort, you can produce cookies that look like they came from a bakery!

I have made many recipes and have not disliked a single one. The smothered pork chops are sooo delicious, the quick chicken curry, fantastic!

+ great pictures
+ I like the 'why this recipe works', tips, techniques and misc. info
+ good instructions
+ keen insights into what works and what doesn't in using a slow cooker and how to address issues
- many recipes seem to be a lot more complicated than necessary, and often use more obscure ingredients

CuteEverythingcom, ^55970510^2^0^"My family loves Food Network, and one of our favorite chefs is Valerie Bertinelli. We appreciate how down-to-Earth she is, and love when she updates classic traditional recipes we all grew up with, but would like to make for our family today. We’re often really busy nowadays, too, so we often just don’t have time to make things the old-fashioned way. So, we are really loving with Valerie’s Home Cooking!
There’s lots of wholesome meals that are also simple to prepare. The Quick Rotisserie Chicken Gumbo is turning into a family favorite — so quick and easy, but with lots of flavor and a great recipe for using up leftover rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. The Slow Cooker Sloppy Joes are another dish my whole family loves, especially served on crusty, fresh-baked rolls with a fresh salad (fruit or veggie) on the side.
The Four Cheese Crab Mac & Cheese is my husband’s favorite, and my kids LOVE the S’mores Popcorn. I appreciate how easy and quick the recipes are — and how suitable they are for our family, especially for fast weeknight meals. The book is really nicely printed, with beautiful photography throughout, I think this cookbook would make an excellent gift for anyone who cooks and would like to bring some added flavors to their kitchen."^5^December 6, 2017

Tonight i'm making the green bean bundles, can't wait!! All the recipes look great. I don't think i'll ever try squirrel or frog, so i'll just substitute those with something else. Miss Kay helpfully suggests substituting chicken for the squirrel in the 'boiled squirrel and dumplings' recipe. The recipes are very easy to understand and follow, and the notes included with each one are so fun to read, and helpful too! Some great tips are also included, such as hard-boiling and peeling eggs.

GFMaggy, ^13054300^19^1^"The first recipe in this cookbook made the best loaf of bread I've ever tasted in my life! I've only been gf for four months. Grocery store gf bread doesn't look at all appealing to me. A dear friend got a new bread machine at her aunt's yard sale for me for $3, so I began my search for a gf breadmaking cookbook. I won't ever need another one! The recipes in this one have a great taste and texture, and the ingredients aren't hard to find at all. The breads freeze well, so there is never any reason to waste a single crumb. I even use the recipes to make up my own bread mixes with all the dry ingredients that are called for. I put them in good quality zipper freezer bags in the freezer and let them set out on the countertop to get to room temperature before adding the wet ingredients in the bread machine. If you or someone you love has to eat gf, you cannot go wrong with this cookbook."^5^October 14, 2011

Make sure you adjust for high altitude if necessary as it is for us in Denver. All I do is reduce the yeast by 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon and it turns out well."^5^September 8, 2011

TabsInNY, ^16215991^1^1^"I bought this cookbook to go with ridged panini pan and a wrought-iron pressed (non-ridge)) lid, as a gift to my Mom, whom has always a press pan. This cookbook, came to me, on a comp page, to the right of my comp screen, as a purchase suggestion. I bought it to go along with the lid, and the pan. I bought the actual ridged non-stick panini pan IN the Walmart store itself. The LID and THIS cookbook were both bought online here. This cookbook is okay and has some great sandwich ideas and combinations. However, to note: this cookbook, gives the impression of a lively and colorfully cookbook, with lots of colored pics in it, but it does NOT, it only only has afew pictures of the already made sandwiches, sadly. Its a nice cookbook itself. I wish I had been able to sift through the pages first, and then make an final decision wether to purchase it, or not. I purchased it, unseen inside, as a gift, to go with an already bought pan. TO NOTE: I clicked Yes (to recommend to this cookbook to a friend) only because it gave me a choice of only a yes or no. If it has the option of a 'maybe' I would of click on it instead. I gave three stars, because it has a great deal of recipes and found it useful."^3^January 20, 2012

I highly recommend the crock pot with coconut and bananas, and the pumpkin/Turkey slow cooker chili. I also really loved the Korean lettuce wraps, but instead of rice, I used cauliflower rice and it was amazing! Going to buy this book for everyone I know."^5^October 27, 2016

I purchased this as a thank you for my mom while she baby sits my dog at work and wants to cook more health friendly meals. I also got the skinny taste cookbook and will write a review on that one.

I especially wanted my morning numbers down. Within a couple days of eating Paleo they ALL came down.  It makes sense to eat more and eat clean. Very easy to follow and I'm not hungry. I was shocked about what is in our food from canned tuna to boxed foods. Even Organic doesn't mean it has healthy ingredients... Carragenan is not healthy! Learned to READ product label ingredients.  The book is set up for anyone and everyone. Options for healthy eating to fat loss,diabetes, autoimmune problems. So many more issues are addressed.  I am off sugar which I never thought I could do. Recipes give many options to suit your needs. Vegan, gluten free,sugar free many other! Exchanges given for every recipe. I purchased this same book for my sister because I was so impressed.

The cocktail recipes are in five categories and then in alphabetical order within each section. I would have preferred all of the recipes together in alphabetical order but there is an index at the back so if you need to find a recipe in a hurry you can use that reference. The book is approximately 4-1/4' X 6' so it doesn't take up a lot of space. It has all the classic recipes and modern recipes in the Urban Chic and Tropical sections.

Very good commentary.  A problem I usually encounter when looking at kids cook books is that the recipes are what people think kids eat, a bunch of snack food or junk food.  Similarly, they try to oversimplify the recipe or add too many shortcut ingredients.  This has none of that, it is easy to follow, but the recipes are good and healthy, and everyone in my family enjoys them.  My 13 year old was very excited to make the lasagna from scratch by herself, and it turned out better than mine and better that my husband's."^5^October 13, 2017

RottieLovie, ^22897626^7^0^"Sarah has written an amazing book explaining The Autoimmune Paleo way of eating, and the science behind it. She explains all about inflammation, the foods that contribute to it, and how to eat in a way to heal your body. I was overwhelmed when diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, but I had good friends who recommended AIP and Sarah's book. She explains everything in a way that made sense to me and is leading me back to a healthy life."^5^September 17, 2014
MrsJenkins51011, ^22897626^6^0^"I am passionate about this book. It is literally lifechanging. I had the honor of reviewing a copy of my new favorite book, The Paleo Approach, this past week and I am so excited to share it with you. This book is like the 'bible' of Paleo eating. It is like a complete life manual that answers every question you could ever think of about Paleo or Primal eating. I am amazed at the author, Sarah Ballantyne, for her extreme dedication in writing this book. I have no idea how many hours she spent pouring over the research for this book, but I assure you, it has to be in the thousands at least. She thought of every single detail. I want to choose a few quotes for you, but it is so hard...I just want to quote the entire book because everything written is so important to the healing of your body.
The book is set up in almost a textbook fashion, except that she writes in a way that makes the book enjoyable to read. It is literally filled with information, but it never leaves you feeling overwhelmed or bored. She makes it all sound so fascinating. She also has an amazing way of 'speaking' to the reader. She writes so that the average person can clearly understand what she is saying, but not so simple that it feels like she is being condescending. I think that is very important and impressive because she is clearly a genius. 
The first pages show a Table of Contents with everything divided neatly into chapters and sections to make it easier if you are looking for something specific in the book. The book is divided into two main parts - The Cause and The Cure. The Cause focuses on Autoimmune Diseases--what they are, dietary factors that contribute to them (for example: foods that do not digest well and genetics), lifestyle factors that contribute to them (such as lack of sleep and medication), and how to move forward to heal your body and add to your life. This part of the book is very interesting to me because most of it is all new information to me and I really enjoy learning. There is a three page list of all the known possible autoimmune diseases, many of which surprised me. I think it's great that she includes this because many of them are not diseases that I would think of as being autoimmune diseases...which means that without this information, many people may not try the Paleo Approach because they are not even aware that it could help them. This list fixes that problem! She goes so in-depth with her explanations that she makes you feel like an expert after you are done. My husband loves to learn, but he has a very short attention span and this book also kept him intrigued. 
The Cure focuses on the lifestyle changes that you can use to help heal your autoimmune symptoms. Sarah writes, 
'Healing is complex. You are not only trying to heal the tissues attacked by your autoimmune disease; you are also trying to restore the barrier function of your gut (that is, fix your leaky guy) and reestablish a normal gut microflora. Your body will need extra nutrition (and sleep, which is discussed in the next chapter) to get started on this process, so the more nutrient-dense your diet is, the better. By eating according to the Paleo Approach, you will flood your body with the nutrients it needs.'

When Sarah begins writing about the foods, she makes it clear that she wants you to succeed. She doesn't just write 'DO NOT EAT THIS' 'DO NOT EAT THAT', she goes in-depth about each food item and why that food is bad for your body. I think that is so important. It makes it harder to follow through with any big change in life if someone just gives you a list of things to avoid without telling you the reasons. When you are given the reasons, it helps to motivate you to make the right choices.

Every single thing about this book shows Sarah's dedication. I just cannot say enough good things about her dedication to this book. You can clearly see that everything was so thoughtfully added. This was not some book that was just thrown together. I hope that if I ever write a book, it is half as wonderful as this one.

This book isn't just for people with autoimmune diseases, this book is for everyone. Everyone should want to learn more about their bodies and understand how every choice they make affets their health."^5^March 8, 2014
CLRobinson, ^22897626^6^0^"As soon as I received this book, I immediately started skimming through it and felt a little overwhelmed. I must admit, I haven't been diagnosed with autoimmune disease although I've wondered if I do, especially given I have many of the symptoms. My father had suffered through Alzheimer's disease for 18 years before his death last year and I've often wondered if he had autoimmune and inflammation issues....and now I know that to be true, thanks to Sarah's book. There is conflicting opinions in the medical world if Alzheimer's is a genetic disease also, which worries me somewhat given I have a lot of the same health issues that my Dad did at the same age. I tried the Paleo lifestyle several years ago but didn't take the time to really understand it and then I heard some people say 'oh, don't do the Paleo thing...it's bad for you'. I was bummed because I just wanted to eat bacon! Lol

Sarah's book is so comprehensive and so amazing that it seemed every page I turned to would answer question upon question that would arise in my head. She has clearly put her heart and soul into every page and for that, I'm incredibly thankful! I'm putting my list together and I'm heading to the store to start on my journey with The Paleo Approach!"^5^February 22, 2014
kels0421, ^22897626^4^0^"For those struggling with food intolerances, autoimmune disease, and other chronic health conditions this is a must purchase! It helps take you from feeling completely overwhelmed with your health state and leaves you feeling able to take control of your health, hopeful to reverse your condition, and armed with the info necessary to accomplish that! With a PHD Sarah Ballantyne has an incredibly brilliant mind for science, and is an incredibly gifted educator with the ability to bring that scientific knowledge down to an understandable level for the everyday man/woman to comprehend. Her recipes are fantastic, the scientific breakdown of these conditions and how to help them superb, and the book as an entirety is a necessity for all! I highly recommend!"^5^August 28, 2014
RockyStillWater, ^22897626^4^1^"I have wanted to improve my health and change my lifestyle habits for the last few years and kind of had an idea of what to do but was lacking motivation. I was experiencing a range of symptoms including joint/muscle pain, extreme fatigue, chronic infections, hair loss, digestive upset, skin rashes/hives, and weight gain. My doctor couldn't offer me any real support. I wasn't sure exactly what I should be eating, but I knew I needed to change my diet and get more exercise. Dr. Ballantyne's research and dedication to helping others with their healing have helped get me on the right track. Buying this book, I thought I was just going to get information on food, and The Paleo Approach contains so much more. While I consider myself to know a good bit about wellness, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book has a great deal of new information and tips on how to be healthy in the bigger picture, including tips on how to SLEEP better.

I have now been on the Autoimmune Paleo diet for almost a month while giving up caffeine, and am seeing huge improvements in my digestion, overall health and energy levels. Plus, Sarah Ballantyne is great at explaining the science for those of us non-science people. I found that reading this book and fully understanding what I was doing to my body by continuing with certain eating and lifestyle habits, really gave me the motivation I needed to make the shift and change my life for the better. The science info can also be helpful when explaining to the people in your life what your up to including the whys and hows.

Best thing is, it's actually working! This way of life is challenging to implement, and having a supportive wealth of knowledge and beacon of success like Dr. Ballantyne is priceless. Love this book. I just bought the Paleo Approach Cookbook, which I highly recommend as well. Also, I have listened to many episodes from Sarah and Stacey's podcast 'The Paleo View' to keep the fires of transformation burning."^5^September 14, 2014
hjpb, ^22897626^2^1^"I had been making regular paleo recipes many times, while throwing in what I thought were healthy gluten-free grains, nuts, beans, and eggs, (and occasionally have a little bit of gluten in a meal)etc. I did not realize that these foods could be undermining optimal nutrition. I am very hopeful after reading what I have read so far because it does make sense. She gives scientific explanations for what she recommends. I suspect that I have auto-immunity because I have lichen planus like the author, and I have had I.B.S. over the years, allergies, sensitivity to fragrances and various things, and more recently I had 2 surgeries for severe endometriosis, which they suspect could be due to an underlying auto-immune condition. Also, my mom has rheumatoid arthritis. So, I think that makes me more likely to have it or some sort of auto-immunity. The hope that this could bring so much more quality to mine and other people's lives is priceless. If you are asking yourself whether this is worth your while, answer yourself with a yes. At the very least, you will learn a lot, and all of us need to be continually learning. At the most, you could gain more health and quality of life than you previously thought possible."^5^September 6, 2014
a2jc4life, ^22897626^2^0^"This book is HUGE. As in, college textbook-size. It's gorgeously designed, in full color, and there's so much information here I don't even quite know where to start!

The tone of the book is one of the best things about it. Dr. Ballantyne is very knowledgeable, and her information is clearly science-based. But it's also very down-to-earth - and understanding. Having 'been there,' in terms of chronic illness, she knows what it's like to be exhausted. She knows what it's like for food to be the enemy. She knows what it's like to be scrabbling for answers. So while her writing is firm, there's also a gentleness there that is often lacking in other health sources. (I don't know about you, but my body beats me up enough; I don't need food writers doing it, too! So this is a big deal to me.)

I really can't begin to tell you all that's IN the book. Seriously - you'll simply have to take a look at it yourself. The first two chapters talk about autoimmune disease - how the immune system is meant to work, what goes wrong that causes autoimmune disease and what sorts of things can trigger it - and about food and how it interacts with this whole process. There is a ton of science here. Many of you may even find your eyes glazing over and have to skim over it or jump forward. It's that in-depth. But anyone who is dealing with autoimmune disease, suspected autoimmune disease, or any kind of chronic illness that doesn't already have some other clear explanation, NEEDS to read this book.

Once this foundation is laid, there is a ton of practical information. What not to eat - but also what to eat. How to address other lifestyle issues like stress management, exercise, and sleep. Supporting various body systems. Supplementation - when it's called for and what to look for. And there's a very long chart of foods with a pretty thorough overview of their nutritional value.

I particularly appreciate that it what can be eaten. There is a whole list of foods that are okay. And it's fairly detailed. I don't just mean 'meat & poultry.' I mean 'antelope, bear, beaver, beef, bison, boar, camel, caribou, deer...' - and as you can probably guess, that's only the beginning. There is so much I can't eat (and I'm not even on the AIP diet yet!) that my brain sort of 'checks out' and I can't remember what I can eat, even though I know there are options, so I found this really helpful.

Definitely worth the investment!"^5^September 25, 2014
musicaldreamer, ^22897626^2^0^"I won this book in a giveaway, and while I had prior knowledge to the paleo lifestyle before reading it I found it very useful in clearing up commonly debated questions and providing easy guidelines. It was very interesting to read the science behind it, and the information was well written and easy to understand. Highly recommended to those looking for a guidebook in starting this lifestyle,"^5^March 10, 2014
CozyCastle, ^22897626^2^0^"Sarah's approach is a very thorough one.

She makes room for the reader who wants to dig into every detail of why various factors, including but not limited to food, affect our health in such dramatic ways. Scientific answers are there in plenty - and explained in a way that most will find something to be grasped.

Sarah also leaves room for the reader who wants to skip past the scientific and get right to the plan and figure out how to start changing their diet today.

This isn't a recipe book - but I sure can't wait until it comes out! Rather this is an extensive, information-packed resource for anyone who wants to understand autoimmune disease and how they can take charge of a significant number of influences on their health.

The book is large, packed full of information, colorful, and clearly laid out. It is inspiring hope that I too can find my way back to good health."^5^March 28, 2014

navoff, ^22897626^1^0^"This is like a text book you'd find in a high school or college course. Some people might find it intimidating at first but I would urge them to keep going. Sarah Ballantyne has put a ton of research into this and it's chock full of information. She breaks down the technical/medical information in a way that the layperson can understand. She also looks at how that break down in the immune system (which is largely in the gut) can manifest itself in different conditions.

What I love is that she doesn't just explain how the immune system works and how it can be compromised but gives you a comprehensive guide to what foods are good for you, what will compromise your immune system (and why) as well as lifestyle changes to improve your health.

Then there are the charts of information to help you understand what nutrients are in foods,lists of what foods are safe to eat (and there are *lots* of options). I know as someone who was diagnosed with a gluten and soy intolerance, that often when you first find out, you tend to concentrate on what you *can't* have rather than what you can. So having a reminder of all the foods that are available out there that won't undermine your immune system is a huge help."^5^February 27, 2014
jellyfish783, ^22897626^1^0^"Sarah Ballantyne is just a genius. This book is so well thought out and researched. She provides so much solid information about the cause of autoimmune illness and how to treat it with diet. I'm dealing with a bit of a mystery illness- so I don't really know if I have an autoimmune illness or not. However, I've tried everything and I think this protocol might be the missing link. Thank you, Sarah. It's absolutely wonderful in every way."^5^February 3, 2014
Ali17, ^22897626^1^0^"As soon as this book arrived, I skimmed it cover to cover.  I haven't read any books about a Paleo Diet yet but have read 6-7 other books recommended by my friends who are M.D.'s and this book is now a must read book from cover to cover on my list.

Personally, I am lactose and gluten-intolerant and have read:  Why We Get Fat And What We Can Do About It, Wheat Belly and Grain Brain and a host of other books and articles and believe that a Paleo diet makes sense for anyone trying to improve their health.

Read, read, read and make healthier food choices."^5^March 2, 2014
ljfljld, ^22897626^1^0^"I bought this book after suffering for years with autoimmune disease. My Dr. recommended the Paleo diet and I have been struggling with committing to it and not fully understanding the connection. This book is like an encyclopedia of information for autoimmone disease and is helping me understand and commit to living this way. I finally see the connection and this book has been able to not only answer any question I have had but also to how to put this lifestyle in action. I have showed it to family members and friends and it gives them visual of what I have been dealing with all of these years and they have all been much more supportive in my lifestyle changes. This is excactly what I needed! Thank you Dr. Sarah Ballantyne!!"^5^February 11, 2014
KRockwell, ^22897626^1^0^"I've been following The Paleo Mom's blog, and I just bought her book, The Paleo Approach: Reverse Autoimmune Disease and Heal Your Body. I want everyone to have it. It is amazing. It covers everything. It talks about the cause of autoimmunity, why Paleo is healing, how to change your diet and lifestyle, how to deal with problems that arise, how to reintroduce certain foods as you heal, and all sorts of little questions that come up when you are on this journey. There are a ton of charts from what ingredients are derived from corn to what vitamins, minerals, sugars, fats and amino acids are in a variety of fruits, vegetables, meats and seafoods. It's truly phenomenal, and it's cheap for a 432 page, glossy bible for health. It's not just for people dealing with autoimmune disease."^5^February 3, 2014

Between the 2 movies, approx. 4 years, he and his costar fall of the wagon.  They embrace their trials and share these experiences with the viewers.

This book contains great tasting recipes on juices, smoothies and plant based dishes.  It's well worth the low price.  While I'm a 100% meat eater I really enjoy the options given in this book."^5^February 5, 2017

Of the recipes: 6 interesting, 8 maybe someday, the rest I would never make. As a reference it fails, as I am creative enough to add a can of this, or a box of that, to make something else. I would probably only try a taste at someone else's home. I will copy a few recipes, and give this away as a gift to someone much, much younger. Biscoff cookies, however, are awesome.

Be sure to follow all the cookware manufacturer's instructions for properly seasoning and cleaning your cast iron; otherwise, your food may stick or pick up rust. It's not rocket science to use and maintain cast iron cookware, but you can't run it through the dishwasher or let it soak in water for extended periods."^5^August 12, 2012

SuzyB, ^23649640^2^0^"I've enjoyed my new cookbook for a few weeks now. It's absolutely beautiful! Every recipe has an amazing, mouth watering photo, the layout is super clean and easy and the pages are are extra heavy and velvety. Almost like you can wipe them clean if something spills on them. The look alone of this cookbook is very impressive and draws you to really 'want' to use it. (I can't say enough about the quality and beauty of this book.) I love the fact that the author, Danielle Walker, has a true passion for comfort food and not any ol' recipe will do just to fill a book. I like that she's spent countless hours testing and creating dishes that really satisfy the taste buds as well as the tummy. That's important to me because my husband and 3 teenagers don't take lightly to dietary changes. However, one thing was a disappointing to me, there is a little overall grain-free education. Danielle Walker's personal story is amazing and inspiring no doubt, but when I originally placed my order for the book, I was under the impression this was an educational book with a few recipes scattered about. Not the case. I will need to continue my quest for grain-free education. What little I've learned this far has been bits and pieces on the Internet. I was hoping this book would shed more light. Overall this is an excellent COOKBOOK with quality recipes and a first rate design and layout. (Just a little side note: there's a section called Navigating a new Lifestyle that talks about ingredients and kitchen/pantry set up that is extremely helpful. The scketches are adorable!)"^3^January 8, 2016

LittleBoones, ^10100439^2^0^"I bought the Melting Pot cookbook about 3 weeks ago and I have already used many of the recipes. First, we did the Swiss Cheese fondue. It turned out ok. I think next time we will try a different cheese recipe. Second we did beef marinated in the balsamic marinade. It was phenomenal! We cooked in the Mojo Style and it was to die for. We will definitely be making this again! I also made the Green Goddess dip and it was great! We also tried the original chocolate fondue and it was easy and tasted delicious! Not only are there fondue recipes but there are also drink recipes. I must say the Sangria recipe is fantastic and I have made it at least 3 times. I would highly recommend this book if you are into trying different things!"^5^October 12, 2010

dandjp, ^17288589^3^1^"I believe you can get most recipes off the net. This has the rubs and there purpose in one section and recipes refer you to that rub page rather than repeating it over and over. It has several recipes for all types of meat Beef ,pork, chicken, turkey, and seafood. A nice variety to all types and in one book. This is not a pellet grilling bible yet nicely done and in one book. Love to try new stuff.

My wife and I conflicted about a gas or charcoal grill. Finding the pellet grill is a perfect fit for us both, and food is so easy to do and taste so great. I do most of the cooking on it. I think that is why my wife loves the grill:) So easy to use and makes me look so good:)"^5^June 22, 2014
olehoosier, ^17288589^3^2^"recipes are ok but a little complex for wood pellet grills.  I use it for grill temp settings for varoius meats  BUT I always use a meat thermometer to insure perfect results.  author makes a lot of trite statements about wood pellet cooking--how he fell in love with his wood pellet grill--comeon--get real.   mis leading health claims about wood pellet cooking you should ignore( every bag of wood pellets used for food prep has a cancer warning) all brands of pellets have to put this on the bag.      author was too in love to notice this I suppose.

The intro goes into basic dutch oven cooking and equipment care as well as first aid and tips. The rest of the book is broken down into meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and dessert if I recall correctly.

CuteEverythingcom, ^853334638^4^0^"In Trisha’s Table, I learned that Trisha adopted the 80/20 rule of eating healthy the majority of the time and enjoying some splurges for the remainder. I was very interested in seeing how Trisha updated southern fare and made it more wholesome and light. She tells us in the book that she doesn’t want anyone to have to sacrifice flavors in order to eat better. The recipes came across to me as clear and easy to prepare. I really liked the spinach frittata, which leaves out the crust from a quiche type of recipe. I did swap out the heavy cream and added milk instead, to make it even healthier. I love the veggies in there, I just use whatever I have available at the time to add in. The vegetable soup recipes is one of my whole family’s favorites, we made it when everyone was feeling under the weather and it was great, especially when paired with slices of sourdough bread. There are gorgeous full page photos of the recipes and there’s even some of Trisha’s family photos, too, which were fun to see!"^5^April 28, 2015

cloud9x2, ^5299718^1^0^"I ordered Sneaky Chef after a recommendation from our family physician because we have a four year old and a two year old who are picky eaters - and we wanted to start eating healthier as a family. And I'm thrilled at the content of this 'cookbook'. Not only does it offer fun, quick and highly nutritious recipes kids (and adults) will eat, it goes indepth about general nutrition, the psychology of kids and food, techniques for healthy cooking, a complete shopping list of staples to have on hand, and more. The best part is all you need to purchase is a mini food processor (about 30 dollars). I've already made multiple recipes with much success and incorporated her ideas into the meals I prepare for my husband and me so we can benefit from the nutritional values while eating the dishes we love. This is not just a cookbook or a technique, it's a whole new way of looking at foods and nutrition. I've never been a very healthy eater but Sneaky Chef has me hooked!! I plan on ordering the Sneaky Chef's newer cookbook and her creative activity book for kids, too."^5^June 9, 2011
dferron, ^16415490^2^0^"I have been home brewing for 1.5 year using extracts, tweaking recipes, and thoroughly enjoying ever sip of it. This book was recommended on a forum I belong to. I liked the idea of small all grain brewing. I did not want to brew a 5 gallon batch (as most all grain brewing is keyed to), liking the smaller batches to be able to try more styles sooner. This book provides lots of information about yeasts, hops, styles and the processes. Within a week of receiving the book I went to my LHBS (Local Home Brew Store) and purchased the grains for my first batch of Blackberry Red Ale. These recipes are easy, and not so complicated as to scare off the new brewer.

With a cover price of $19.99 the $13 was a bargain ... the least expensive of any online sellers including eBay."^5^January 16, 2012

Instructions are so complete even a dummy like me can follow them. Every recipe has beautiful colored pictures every step of the way. I was so amazed when mine turned out just like theirs.

Cucuzza, ^55104422^3^0^"Move over Lidia, there's a new girl in town!

Perhaps you never thought to write them down… or maybe you were too young to learn them at the time…Soooooo, if you are searching for your Nonna’s long lost recipes from yesteryear, then stop reading, and immediately add this book to your cart!

As a restaurateur and a formally trained chef specializing in Italian cuisine, I can confidently comment with authority on the authenticity and accuracy of these recipes. I have already personally tested several of the recipes, and the ingredients and simplicity are blissful perfection. The book brilliantly amalgamates the knowledge and expertise of countless grandmothers throughout the many regions of Italy whose gastronomy is as unique and diverse as their respective dialects.

It is so much more than just a “cookbook.” It astutely incorporates the art and science of cooking while dovetailing stories of family, experience, and passion via the heritage of our ancestors’ food. The author’s charismatic personality, as seen in her addicting web-series, fluidly transcends into print, accentuating her creativity and originality with delicate finesse and relatability.

Btw, it's huuuuuuuge! It is definitely a lot of book for the money, and well worth every cent! The binding, paper stock, caliber of printing, and vividness of the photos are of the utmost quality. The only 'con' is that the font could've been slightly larger. Maybe I need a stronger prescription. Overall, it is a well-written, beautifully presented and visually appealing masterpiece that will surely be utilized by our family for many years to come. Can’t believe this is her first book! Looking forward to many more! Keep on keeping on!

Italian-Americans, who are from any region, truly owe this charming young lady a tremendous debt of gratitude for all of her hard work and diligence for documenting such an integral aspect of our existence and ethos, our food. For so many of us, food is a fundamental component of our identity and our lives because it is so deeply interwoven with some of our fondest, family memories.

On behalf of my own personal family, it is with tremendous appreciation, that we most graciously thank you for carrying on this legacy and for taking us back in time by sharing your passion for Italian food, culture, and family with your audience. Your recipes and videos will serve as a cooking encyclopedia for many generations to come by preserving our culinary treasures from extinction. May God continue to bless you and your Nonna in all of your future endeavors. Auguri! Strong work!

I also purchased the Camp Chef Sushezi Maker at Walmart.com and was so impressed with it I am going to get both of these items for myself. I went on youtube.com and watched several video's of the Sushezi Maker being demonstrated on how easy it is to use. It made sushi making even for the beginner easy to do.

TheEnigmaMarisa, ^14954305^10^0^"Pros: Awesome recipes. One index sorted by ingredient. The whole book is grouped into sections like breakfast, beverages, appetizers, etc. All the Hungry Girl usual nutrition info is on every page.

Cons: One index sorted by title of recipe, which isn't helpful, because they all have cute creative names. There aren't pictures of every recipe... the whole book is printed in red/pink ink except for a few full color pages in the middle."^5^May 12, 2011

MomLo62, ^14954305^3^3^"in my opinion, this is not a good cookbook. The 'egg mugs' were blah! (Egg Beaters cooked in the microwave are rubbery and bland).

I have always wondered what would it be like to try vegan foods, would it be tasteless and have weird displeasing textures? Well when I got a hold of this book all of my questions where answered, vegan foods can be flavorful and yummy, the textures aren't off putting! I never knew healthy foods could actually taste SO GOOD and be healthy for you at the same time. The recipes in this book are quick and easy to prepare, the recipes are budget friendly and there is also nutritional information available for every recipe in the book. Last but not least there are beautiful pictures to go along with most of the recipes in the cookbook. I know using this cookbook will be a fresh start to a healthier and happier me."^5^December 26, 2011

ranchdog2, ^24643989^2^0^"Overall, a good cookbook, typical of America's Test Kitchen, with great attention to details. Plusses and minuses are:
+ not a repeat of recipes from the original Slow Cooker Revolution cookbook, its predecessor
+ requires no more than 15 minutes of active prep time
+ great pictures
+ I like the 'why this recipe works', tips, techniques and misc. info
+ good instructions
+ keen insights into what works and what doesn't in using a slow cooker and how to address issues
+ even for recipes that I'm not particularly interested in, I've been able to learn from reading them (about ingredients, techniques, etc.)
- some recipes seemed 'force-fitted' for use in a slow-cooker, but I guess it gives people options for handling recipes in different ways"^4^November 7, 2013

PatriciaNY, ^46224304^12^0^"EXTREMELY HELPFUL COOK BOOK! Spiralize It! is a book that is really needed!

Like a lot of people who love kitchen gadgets, I purchased the spiralizer! In fact I purchased two different models; I have the crank spiralizer and the hour glass spiralizer. The problem is after the novelty of putting a few things in it to make veggie spaghetti and garnishes, the novelty wore off and it was placed on the shelf of things I impulsively bought!

This book took my spiralizer gadgets off the 'impulsively bought' shelf to the 'useful kitchen gadget' shelf! Spiralize It! by Kenzie Swanhart taught me how to take my spiralizer from being a garnish maker to being a FULL nutritional meal maker! This book offers Creative Recipes that are simple to make. It starts with showing you the different types of spiralizers and offering the pros and cons of each type. It continues on to Classic Cravings which speaks about the more common dishes most people like. It then continues as a normal cookbook offering sections on Breakfast, Snacks and Sides, Salads, Vegetarian and Vegan, Raw, Fish and Seafood, Meat and Poultry, and Sweets! In each of these sections you will find recipes for many dietary needs. To name a few, there are the Paleo, Dairy Free, Gluten Free, Vegetarian and Vegan Diets as well as the Picky Kids diet!

This book will also help you learn to swap out carbs for veggies and will help you tailor your recipes to suit your spiralizer. The also features a list of dressings, marinades and sauces to use on your spiralized veggies as well as a list of the produce with the least and greatest amount of pesticides. It closes with a Measurement conversion chart.

I found most helpful the BEAUTIFUL pictures. I am a visual person and being able to see what a food item will look like after it is spiralized was a HUGE benefit for me! Just knowing what the end product would be built my confidence to experment and be more creative myself!

I especially liked the Chicken Pad Thai, it was savory and rich! The raw rainbow noodle salad was a hit with my family! My kids just ADORED the sweet potato waffles! I am enjoying this book and I am enjoying the wonderful recipes! I am also having fun with creating some of my own recipes. This book is not only a great manual for the spiralizer, it is also a great motivator! I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE who owns a spiralizer or is thinking about getting one! I guarantee that you will be as PLEASED as I am to own it!"^5^January 25, 2016
Freesocial2011, ^46224304^5^0^"I got a spiralizer a few months ago, and only have used it once since then. I figured Spiralize It!: Creative Spiralizer Recipes for Every Type of Eater could help me come up with some ideas for some new meals. Spiralize It! is a 90 page book full of recipes and tips to help make spiralizing even easier for you. I found the book and recipes very easy to read, everything is layered out well into the different chapters. Honestly, while there is a good amount of recipes in the book, I only found a few I 'may' possibly make in the future. Most of these did not appeal to me.

Overall, a great book for anyone interested in eating healthy, cutting down on simple fat gaining carbohydrates and sugars. The recipes are varied, many and for the most part simple to make."^5^June 30, 2016
amfrazi, ^15440397^5^0^"I really liked this cookbook. It ranks up there as one of my top two favorites (the other being Paleo Comfort Foods by Julie and Charles Mayfield). Whether you follow a primal/paleo type diet or not, this cookbook is good - the recipes are tasty and easy to follow. Glad I came across this book at the library. It's made a nice addition to my collection of cookbooks."^5^May 10, 2012
