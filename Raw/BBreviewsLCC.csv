Okay, full disclosure... I had the 3900x in my cart and this was the only board Best Buy had that wasn't sold out.  But i was relieved to see online folk recommending it in reviews.  It works pretty well.  

I had no issues, save for having to deactivate wifi in the Bios to get Windows to install.  That took longer than it should have to figure out, but I'm not an expert at this stuff.

However, I feel that even though they stripped some features of this motherboard like temp sensors, no flashback button, and on board usb-c header. I feel that for what you pay is not a bad thing at all. So for 

Pro: Nice looking motherboard with very good VRMs and a lot of protections. Ran the AMD Ryzen 3700X pretty well and is worth it, if you are not planning to overclock. It is able to run 3700X, 3800X, 3900X, and 3950 base on VRMs power capacity.

Cons: No bios flashback to recover you must remove the battery and hope it clears your issues. No USB-C header on the motherboard for a case that may have a front USB-C port. The motherboard release some pretty high heats from it so you need a very airflow case. System kept my fans pretty high and they went up and down a lot with the speed, even on silent mode. Weird bios behavior Froze at 90% bios flash, before flash and after laggy, and choppy mouse pointer. 

My thoughts: Overall is a nice starter build motherboard with the ability to run a 3700X/3800X/3900X, and 3950X. For the price you can't beat it."^4^Oct 24, 2019 9:58 PM

I do wish the manual was a little more clear. On one page of the manual when talking about hooking up the power supply, it says do not hook up only a 4 pin for cpu power, but do an 8 or an 8 and a 4 since only a 4 may cause it to overheat. Then later it shows a picture of you hooking up only a 4. (To just have it take up half of the 8 pin slot.) That is confusing. Also, many power supplies, like mine, dont have an 8 connector at all, but have two 4s instead. After talking to many people and doing research, I found I could hook up both 4s to get to 8 total pins. I did one to the 8 slot and one to the 4 slot. Wish it would have mentioned that as a possibility.

Windows 10 did not pick up the wifi drivers, so be sure and save the drivers to a thumb drive in advance if needed!

Also, bios picked up my hard drives but wouldn't boot them. Manual doesn't mention this, but I had to go into bios and select a compatibility mode of legacy only instead of the new + legacy, for my ssd to boot.

Hope this helps!"^4^Dec 1, 2019 5:50 PM

Bad luck on that, the board failed to post several times and the wifi was very poor, but rgb was great. 

This board was very simple to setup, the wifi was amazing in comparison. Some key factors, Aura rgb needs community fixes to get running correctly, out of box it has failed since 2018. Asus armory needs to be disabled in bios before your OS install, and don't run Asus AI3 suite. Asus handy helper tools like this often cause driver conflicts or just irregularities. Besides that it is a fantastic board, if you can only get one x570 board in a 200$ price range at best buy this is the best choice."^4^Oct 7, 2019 10:45 PM

The VRM's are excellent (check buildzoids youtube channel, gives great opinion on then, and also Hardwareunboxed, they tested the temps, and are among the lowest VRM's temps for the price).

Stability is great, I have it paired with a Ryzen 9 3900x and it can boost up to 4.55Ghz totally stock (very close to the 4.6ghz advertised). 

I also have two 16gb sticks of corsair vengeange pro rgb 3200mhz, overclocked at 3600mhz (using Ryzen dram timings calculator) totally stable.

It has nice features, like wifi and gig lan. The onboard sound is nice and up to 7.1. Some people say the chipset fan is noisy, but can't hear it at all, granted my PC is in the floor and closed. It does spin all the time though, I wish Asus would provide a bios update with fan profiles for it (like other mobos, like a silent one when temps are low and then ramps up when temps go up).

It does not support SLI, but who cares, SLI and Crossfire are dead now anyways.

There was a bios update, latest one is 1005, highlty recommend to update it.

Only con, is it appears to have an incompatibility with my Fnatic streak keyboard, but just in the bios. Its totally useless, it lags and I cannot type at all in there to change values. Once it boots to windows its fine. Hope it can be fixed on a bios update.

Other than that, great mobo for 3rd gen ryzen for the price, the VRM'S are great (12+2, actually 4 phases but tripled, which are more than fine, see the reviews above on those youtube channels!)."^5^Aug 23, 2019 4:04 PM

It has a good aesthetic, great thermals and decent overclocking capability for the price. However, ASUS proudly advertises the motherboard as a RGB board. This was at first simply a bonus to the already nice set of features on the board, but it turns out that AURA SYNC is horrible. After having issues with my colors resetting to default rainbow every time I played Rainbow Six Siege (ironic, I know), I decided to simply try reinstalling the software. Huge mistake on my part. Now the program won't even open, and my PC is stuck with a single color and pattern. ASUS support won't even talk to me, it tells me to ask Best Buy for help every time even though Best Buy likely knows little about how AURA even works. If you're an RGB enthusiast, either go for a different mobo brand or pay the premium for Corsair fans and etc. ASUS is not the way to go for RGB."^3^Dec 5, 2019 3:10 PM

But there are lots of potential bugs and at least one certain bug. First off, be sure to start with the QVL on this product, quite a few of Best Buy's DRAMs are not on it. Secondly, be aware that the drivers are a little buggy. I've only run in to one certain instance, but its annoying. For me, when using one of the two USB 2.0 headers, for some reason, the board kills the Wi-fi/Bluetooth. Switch to the second header on the board and the Wi-fi turns back on. I'm also having an intermittent failure to load past the 'Welcome' screen, but can't place blame squarely on the board yet as I'm using PNY's memory and they are not on the QVL. Additionally, some are reporting similar issue with a Win 10 update. So it may be QVL related, it may be Win 10, or it could be the board... unsure.

The last thing, I'm just not used to the BIOS options, lots of tinkering was needed to simply boot up initially. My past boards have been plug and play, but that's not the case with this one, for me. The settings were Boot device compatibility features (CVM, UEFI/Legacy). Not a big deal, but again something that needs to be found during setup. 

All that said, it is a very good board when it works. Seems weird to say its stable after all that, but it is... when it boots."^2^Oct 28, 2019 10:47 AM

I have a Ryzen 7 3700x in it and love the speed. I was able to overclock my memory from 3000 to 3200 with very nice timings. The motherboard supports lots of memory options and very good manual overlocking support for memory. Temps are low across the board.

I'm taking away a star because of a few annoying things. Spread spectrum cannot be disabled which causes several monitoring apps to show your base clock at 99.8 meaning you don't see true 4.4ghz speeds. You're technically still achieving those speeds, it's just very dumb that we cant disable spread spectrum.

This means you also cannot adjust the base clock. The reason it's annoying these features are not available is because this is the X570 chipset, the highest-end AMD AM4 socket chipset. Access to these basic features should be there."^4^Sep 27, 2019 11:13 AM

After I returned two IBUYPOWER gaming PCs.  Tthe 1100 dollar system had a ASUS 365 board that over heated big time...not over clocked either by third day of game play, and the 1500 dollar system had an ASROCK hunko-junk bottom of the barrel board that would not let me install a fresh Windows 10 and had a monster ugly bios to work with.

I got the ASUS TUF Gaming X570 because it was affordable (less than 200 bucks), and I wanted an AMD system (the IBUYPOWER systems had GREAT components that included an Intel i7 9700k processor).  I wanted to build my system from scratch, and I wanted it better than the pre-built systems.  I did no research on this ASUS TUF GAMING before I bought it.  It was just within my budget, and it was on hand.

AFTER I put my system, I was QUITE pleased with it.  I did all the research later, and this board gets a LOT of positive YouTube test videos, AND Ive not found any negative reviews except by reviewers that want a higher end gaming system.  I dont count these because they could really find no faults with the board except for wanting more higher end gaming functions...like more than casual enthusiast level need.

It is NOT as fast as the IBUYPOWER systems.  For example, my M.2 drives ran faster bench marks on the IBUYPOWER systems I bought (and returned for valid reasons:  Over heathing and not accepting my Fresh Windows installs).  But that said, the benchmarks are still within what would be expected and as advertised.  Blazing fast speed anyway is what I get on this board...read/write is super fast (just faster on the IBUYPOWER systems).

My Asus board has never crashed or frozen.  The board temps never go past the high 20s Celsius as far as temp.  My Graphics card, AMD CPU and memory stay cool and well within normal good temps (never above low 60s on the CPU...the Graphics card stays in the low 40s).  I boot into windows from power start button to sign on in about 8 seconds (M.2 drive is amazing).  The bios is SO EASY to work with; fairly intuitive and safe to play around with if you are a beginner...just as advertised.  I highly recommend doing YouTube searches on functions you understand in the bios.  I doesnt take much time, and you would quickly learn there is a lot of stuff you dont even need to play with because its all taken care of, but if you gotta do something, its easy enough to undo it and return to normal/default. 

Im a moderate gamer, and the game of choice (world of Warcraft) is not the most demanding game.  The Asus TUF Gaming Plus X570 is perfect for this.  I have an AMD Ryzen 3800X, and Corsair Dominator Platinum 3.2 ghz RAM (RGB is cool).  I find I do NOT need to over-clock, but I did try some minor automated over clocking, and the system remained super stable, and no over heating with just the AMD Ryzens packed cooling fan (The Prism Wraith).  I run my CPU on factory Default just because there is no need to over-clock for my needs, but if you needed to, I found no issues with what little automated over-clocking I did do.  I have a Corsair 850 power source, and I have both the 8 and the 4 power connecter  plugs plugged into the board.  Every thing runs perfectly.  NO PROBLEMS AT ALL!

I have two M.2 drives on my system.  I decided to not have any other drive types and prefer to just use peripheral drives for other storage needs.  Both drives run equally fast (Gen. 3X4), so there was no sacrifice.  My Graphics card (Nvidia RTX 2070 Super) also Runs at full potential...no lane sacrifices at all and reads at Gen. 3.0x16).

So, for me?  I have my gaming needs met, and I pay my bills, watch YouTube videos, web browsing...etc, all work just as they should on this system running the ASUS TUF GAMING X570.

After doing a lot of comparing, this board was NOT one of them.  Asus offered a very solid power phase handling for reliable and strong power delivery, RAM overclocking, good cooling on the VRMs and southbridge, reinforced PCI x16 lane, good connectivity, and an attractive looking board.  Many boards above this price range attempt to overdo the gamer stereotype, and this TUF series is a simple, less is more approach.  CPU dropped in, the board posted just fine, and the memory overclock worked well.  Aura lighting connected well and has worked flawlessly since day one.  I've had two times where the board will power on, leave a red LED on the board and refuse to post... Hard power off and fire back up fixes that and its been so minor in the time I've had it that I don't take away anything from the board as I suspect a BIOs fix is incoming. 

My only complaint about this board is that the QFan control (Which is an Asus thing, not just this board) is total garbage.  Run the configuration/listening tool, and it will change the min/maxes of your fans every time, and really just doesn't do a good job controlling them either.  It maxes the 'graph' of changes at 70c, which a stock 3700x on the Wraith cooler will touch on load, and it will spike at that temperature often, so your fans will rev quite a bit and be pretty annoying overall.  For this reason I'd recommend a manual fan controller of some type... Corsair, thermaltake, anyone really.  

Overall I recommend the board.  Its the right combination of price, performance, features, looks, and brand name/warranty.  The fan issue prevents me from giving it a 5* review, but it doesn't deter me from recommending it."^4^Sep 13, 2019 4:01 PM

It appears well made and has whats needed for perhaps a 1st time builder or someone who has no desire to wrap up $10k in a build that has a threadripper and multiple GPUs. It has everything needed for an ADVANCED build: space for 4-DDR4 RAM up to 4,000Hz. Theres room for 2 GPUS running in SLI. 2-M.2 ports.  Its an X570 board and supports PCIe 4.0. Its wireless if thats what you need. Has more than enough SATA ports.  
I cannot think of any reason a builder would need anything more than this board unless you are a serious, high end, enthusiast that is spending upward of $10,000.00 on their build. The price point is good. It was easy to install. All hardware necessary was included. BIOS was easy to navigate and update.
I was really looking at some of the $400-$700 MBs because I felt as though I had to have THE BEST. But then I had to reality check myself and ask...What do I need?  I realized this MB has literally EVERYTHING I needed. No frills. I didnt need to spend an extra $500 on a top of the line MB that has technology that requires very expensive hardware to take advantage of it. 
If youre looking for an excellent MB for less than $200, then this would be it!  Even several PC reviewers recommend this MB for under $200.  No regrets...absolutely none. I love this MB."^5^Feb 18, 2020 12:34 PM

Although this motherboard does not have all the frills/features of higher end motherboards, I actually prefer the minimalist nature of this motherboard. I also like the TUF color scheme. 

I installed a Ryzen 9 3900X, 32GB DDR4 2933MHz ram, 512GB NVMe M.2 (and other Firecuda/SATA SSDs) and an RX Vega 64 (Power Color RX 5700XT Red Devil on the way though) and all went well without any issues (POST no problems, BIOS setup was a breeze and even my Windows 10 transfer via sysprep/driver removal went unexpectedly smoothly).

The gaming rig was pretty stable which is why I decided to build the work PC as an identical rig. Problem is it was flaky from the start. Windows crashed out twice locking up, and the second time the SSD vanished and was not found by the motherboard. I reseated the memory, graphics card, SSD etc but it was still flaky so I decided to upgrade the BIOS to v1405 from the v1404 that came with it. Boom. Instant brick that I had to return to Best Buy for an exchange.

Then to top it all off, last night I was running CrystalDiskMark on the gaming rig to see if it was better after doing a firmware update on the Corsair MP600 I am using, and boom, it rebooted itself in the middle of doing the test.

Now finally if you look at the layout of this board, some idiot at ASUS decided it would be a great idea to put the motherboard chipset fan right behind the primary PCIe slot. Guess what goes there? Your GPU. And guess what happens if you have a half decent GPU with 2 or more fans on it that it is double wide? It covers the *entire* motherboard fan, so the motherboard chips can't breathe!

So at this point not only is the BIOS super flaky, but I suspect part of the general flakiness of this board may well be due to the motherboard chipset fan not being able to do it's job. Guess I am gonna try the MSI boards out.

Oh, and if you do get this motherboard (or actually any X570 chipset motherboard), you will need at least an 850W power supply. Not because it needs all that power, but because it needs an extra 4-pin 12V ATX power supply connection next to the standard 8-pin 12V ATX connection and power supplies less than 850W generally only come with one of those (as I found out). In order to get decent performance use Precision Boost Overdrive on your CPU (especially if you have a Ryzen 9 3900X or bigger), you will want that extra 12V power line attached. I suspect one reason the work rig was flaky is because I did not have that attached but it was still flaky even with PBO disabled."^1^Jan 3, 2020 3:26 PM

- My editing with Vegas Edit 15 felt faster and smoother with my 2700x (maybe the 8 core 16 threads played out better)

Overall consider the 3700x and 9700K if you're buying a new chip for the long haul I picked this one because I never have had an Intel before and gaming has been much better. Content creation has been the same or a little worse to the 2700x so I can only imagine the 3700x"^5^Aug 30, 2019 4:01 PM

I decided upon the i7-9700K because extensive research kept proving again and again that if you are primarily using your computer for the function of gaming, there is a very slight difference between the two.

As far as how it performs in the aforementioned category, EXTREMELY well. I have it paired with a RTX 2080 and there seems to be very little bottlenecking going on here. I have the processor overclocked at 5.2Ghz where it will happily sit at about 65 degrees attached to an AIO Corsair H150i.

If you want to do moderately intensive AVX workloads, look elsewhere to the AMD Ryzen platform for those tasks. Where you benefit from the headroom given to do those tasks while not drawing an enormous amount of power from the wall.

If you are the type that is into photo manipulation or an Adobe Premiere user, this product is for you. If you need effects to be completely quickly, or fast timeline scrubbing the 9700k can easily do this and shave time off from rending queues.

And as for gamers this probably the best bang of the buck for high refresh rate monitors and competitive gaming. Just make sure you pair it with an appropriate graphics card. Do, however make sure it's something you need for an edge in your games and not just a flashy showpiece.

As stated before about power draw, this CPU can draw quite abit of it. It can draw about 160watts +/- 15% while on load at stock settings. If you do intend to overclock as per the 'K' moniker allows, power draw can easily hit 220+ Watts. Try to pair this with a bespoke motherboard for reliable stability. Be sure not to skimp on an efficient cooling solution, under load it can hit the 80s or 90s on regular.

Secondly, the cpu boosts to 4.9 with ease.  I have a Corsair water cooler on the unit and it runs in the low to mid 60s when the fans are set to balanced at 4.9.   With the fans on quiet it runs in the high 60s to low 70s, still pretty cool.  Im sure if it was over locked to 5.2 or something it would run into the mid to high 70s, still not terrible.

While a lot of factors go into actual use, I find my games run very well with no issues.  The cpu usage on COD Modern Warfare is between 40 to 60%, so only using 4-5 of the 8 cores.

The board ships with the older 1.30 bios from last year, the 9600k will work, but not 9700k."^5^Aug 24, 2019 3:02 PM

With 8 Cores and a base speed of 3.6Ghz (4.7Ghz Turbo boost | 5Ghz+ with OC), there isn't a game in existence that this can't run.

I will give you fair warning, however: this processor doesn't include hyperthreading capabilities. So streamers, YouTubers, and creative connoisseurs may want to look at the I9-9900k or even the newer AMD 3700X, 3800X, or 3900X processors! They are definitely a hardy competition for Intel's lineup and are worth the look!

TLDR:
Great for gaming, not so much for multitasking/creative use.

Pros: 
8 Cores
4.7Ghz Turbo boost
OC to over 5Ghz (at your own risk)

Cons:
No hyperthreading (may lack for steaming and YouTube)
Needs decent cooling
Price may be a bit high"^5^Jul 19, 2019 10:37 PM

AMD has been much better about keeping their CPU's compatible with their supporting motherboards by minimizing disruptive socket changes despite frequent CPU updates. 

If you are in the market for a new CPU, I would wait until the Comet Lake CPUs become widely available along with the supporting motherboards. Then weigh the advantages and drawbacks of Intel and AMD.

If you play mostly older games, as I do, it's not that large an issue ATM, but once the next generation consoles arrive for the 2020 Xmas shopping season, the picture may change significantly.

The decorative container in the picture was broken for both CPUs. Fortunately this didn't bother the CPUs at all, as they are inside a protective box in the center.

I let him know that it was either price match both or I'd happily return one and then turn around and buy it again at the lower price. After 'talking with his supervisor' he was able to provide a price match on both units 'just this once'.

For those worried about 80plus white rating, it has nothing to do with quality, only efficiency.  A bronze isn't much more efficient, and believe it or not a good only provides 5 to 7% more efficiency.

My AMD system arrived with just a single 8GB stick (which was actually slower than this option from Corsair), so since I wanted to get the most out of my Ryzen 5, I needed faster RAM and take advantage of dual-channel.

Honestly it's hard to beat this if you're on a budget.

I got this to upgrade a machine from an RX 480 for AAA game development and game content creation.

I have very specific feature and functional requirements and the hardware I choose must meet those requirements, but it must also be at an affordable price and offer a specific level of performance and features I expect within reasonable limits.

These requirements are easier to meet with today's hardware from AMD.

The RX 480 was more than enough for my needs but I had the opportunity to upgrade to a RX 580 that was available at store for a reasonable price, any higher and I would've skipped it.

I considered the RX 590 and even 5700 XT and NVIDIA RTX graphics cards but the prices of those cards plus the features and performance they offer at that cost is a huge drawback compared to the basic requirements needed.

The RX 590 would use alot more wattage, run hotter, perform 20% - 30% better but cost more when that level of performance and watt usage isn't needed to achieve those same graphical results visually and this version of the RX 580 can actually match the RX 590 for the most part with some proper tweaks while running cooler and using less wattage.

The same goes for the 5700 XT though it's in a higher level class of performance balance for a higher tier of newer card, that price does come at a premium and availability of 590 and 5700 models are sketchy right now.

NVIDIA Graphics Cards and RTX in general are way overpriced for the performance and what's actually needed and they don't have enough shader processors and low latency compared to AMD. Though the tech demo's look nice and game engine's are now starting to feature NVIDIA's ray tracing functionality, during development so far I've not had anyone once suggest to me the need to use NVIDIA's ray tracing for realism, content creation, or Ubisoft quality graphics, I know the Star Wars games and various titles are now using it. From my personal experience, so far I've never needed to use it in development or content creation and that's a fact, and is not something I ever think about. Though the soft shadows look nice when the feature is turned on, it doesn't justify the price for development or usage of that 1 feature. But I'll look into it if prices ever come down in the next few years.

I work with things such as Unreal Engine, Blender, Quixel, Substance, and much more. This video card handles everything I've thrown at it and then some, both the RX 480 and RX 580 can play the latest generation games without any problem.

It play's video's on Youtube and movie sites 1080p60fps smoothly on standard 1080p Full HD screens, it optionally down samples the 4k content to fit lower resolution screens with increased quality with a slight performance decrease.

It handles 8k and 16k or larger landscape resolution content development fine too but the standard is usually no higher than 4k for most environments with 2k being even more common or even just 1k, highest recommended being 64k that would be for resolution scale and then the others would be the actual texture to screen resolutions.

The physics (especially with vehicle, aircraft, and environment simulations and interactions), particles, animations, VR, audio, and graphics rendering work beautifully and are very responsive.

8GB of GPU memory is perfect capacity for textures loaded into memory, the cache speed is fast and with the capacity leaves plenty of room for proper optimization during content creation, testing, and for final production as well as for later optimization.

Game streaming options are solid on a stable wired network much like the RX 480, the RX 480 used over half it's power for Steam Link Streaming of games, with direct gaming and streaming with ReLive and DVR turned off was much better, RX 580 is uses much less resources than that and further improves upon streaming.

The latest versions of the AMD Software offers more improved Live Broadcasting, Streaming, and Recording options for gaming, ESports, and casual, with support for more live streaming and video service accounts. So if you're a gamer, developer, content creator, teacher, or want to communicate remotely you can do so with a higher level of quality. As with the more recent years of previous generation video cards there is dedicated circuitry in these cards that handles recording live video so gameplay and regular computer usage performance is not impacted. The DVR functionality is already in the card and it's software.

The only things I don't like about the RX 580 is that the XFX logo doesn't light up, there's a cheap sticker instead, and the fan's look like cheap plastic and don't light up either and the heat pipe is too close to the power connector and wiring. I generally don't get something at a price like this that is this old (the box says 2016), but this is a quality product that offered the price to performance at the benefit of an upgrade.

So if you've got anything less than an RX 580, I'd get an RX 580 if there's one in stock at store, or just wait until the next generations of cards come out and get a full sized card that is affordable because at this point in time most these cards are more than capable of doing what you'd be using it for and spending more wouldn't make much sense for most cases."^5^Jan 14, 2020 7:19 AM

Installation was simple. The metal backplate gives the card a solid feel and helps dissipate heat, The wide copper heat pipes do a very good job of removing heat from the gpu and memory. 
I am not a big gamer however if I wanted to play AAA titles this card can handle them on ultra high settings at 1080 or 1440.  I mainly develop applications and perform productivity tasks, because this cards architecture is based on the 480 it shares the same computational power but does so more efficiently.  The 4k capability and multi monitor support are great. Although AMD has come out with the Vega VII and RX5700 each of those cards are clocking in at $300.00+. At just about $220 this card now(which was the top card from AMD 18 Months ago) fills a mainstream segment that wants decent upgrade  without breaking the bank."^5^Nov 20, 2019 10:15 PM

The fans and cooling on this are great. By default they let it run pretty hot but if you go in and turn down the target temperature in wattman it can stay cool with the fan running super quiet. It undervolts on the CPU well for less power consumption and sees almost 50% performance boosts by adjusting the memory straps and overclocking there.

I was all kinds of excited after reading all the reviews, checking out benchmarks, and knowing I wouldn't be running any 4k monitors for the next couple years. Installed this card in my system, downloaded drivers, installed all the AMD software and started gaming. Worked great until I was about 15 minutes into a game and my system crashed. Booted back to bios and realized my system temp was resting in the high 80's. Did some google searching the next day to find out I missed the detail about AMD cards running warm. To counter this I adjusted my fan curves more aggressively and went back to business as normal. Until my system crashed again. I contacted BB and was told to check with the manufacturer. So I contacted XFX to see what I could do. They recommended aggressive fan curves (in my case 3 Arctic F120 exhaust fans and 2 Arctic F140 intake fans installed and on the GPU), undervolt, underclock or attach aftermarket cooling solution. I tried more aggressive fan curves, undervolting and underclocking the card and still could not get this thing to idle below 80c. Contacted XFX again and was told adjust fan curves, undervolt, underclock, and I could reapply thermal paste. At this point, my pc sounded like a jet taking off (with my fans maxed out I can move about 200cfm in and 210cfm out in an mATX case) and my patience with this card was wearing a bit thin. I returned the silicone lottery fail to BB, and bought a GTX 1660ti. This card was just way too much work and headache for what should have been a basic plug and play.

While my gaming rig which is a GAMING BEAST ran oculus with no issues. So I decided to buy him an rx 580 gts black edition. Worked in the pc for a week and then the pc just shutdown one day and would not start back up. Checked cpu, hdd, ram, etc. everything worked without the 580 in it. Tried 580 in another working pc....NOTHING. So the card died. Have had similar issues with amd cards in the past. Short.....DONE WITH AMD! Have also owned several nvidia and not a single issue.

As soon as this card came under load and was over 60celcius both my HDMI and DP connections would drop signal on and off like someone was unplugging and re-plugging the cables. Meanwhile the DVI connection was rock solid and had no issues. I have 2x80mm / 1x120mm inbound airflow into my case and 1x80mm / 1x120mm outbound so I knew this wasnt the issue. Upon doing some research I found this has been a semi-common issue with these cards. 

To eliminate other root causes I popped my gtx970 in the same slot and all of my issues disappeared, pointing to this card. 

Regarding the AMD software it has some AWESOME features but no safeguards. By this I mean it allows you to make changes (like enable HDR) but these changes are actually toggling Windows settings.

-My mobo didn't have a USB-C/ USB 3.1 Gen 2 plug, so the usb-c was kinda useless for now. I have a ASUS TUF GAMING WIFI x570, fairly new, but did come with a usb-c port on the back of the mobo.

Levire^/nzxt-h510-compact-atx-mid-tower-case-with-tempered-glass-matte-black/6364328?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"I just bought this case for my new Ryzen 5 2600X build. Right away I could tell that NZXT designers really thought this case design through. I found the case to be intuitive to work with. The finished build is great looking and very functional.

The cable management solution is very nice with the velcro straps for the main PSU cables and tons of anchor points for zip ties for other component wires like fans, etc. All of the cable mess is behind the motherboard panel and totally out of view even if you do a poor job with cable management.

The stock case fans were quiet, but I replaced them with my Corsair LL120 fans for top and rear exhaust, and two Corsair ML120 fans for intake.

The tempered glass panel is beautiful and mounts with only one thumb screw. This makes access to the inside very quick and easy.  Just be careful as removing the panel can be tricky, and it is glass.  The wire management side attaches with two thumb screws and is also easy to work with.  I did, however, replace all the thumbscrews with better anodized versions.  The stock screws are plastic gripped ones and looked cheap.

This case is very much worth the money over the low budget cases. I would definitely recommend it to a friend for any workstation or gaming machine within 'normal' spec and moderate overclocks. If you plan to go nuts with overclocking components you may want to spend a little more for a case with more airflow or use water-cooling."^4^Dec 13, 2019 6:39 PM

I appreciate the fact that it costs what it did because I was able to fit approximately $3000 worth of parts in it and not have an issue. You can indeed fit a 280mm rad in the front of the case and set the fans as an intake on the radiator and have good idle temps.

The only negatives I found were that the thumb screw points felt a little cheap to me and the tempered glass door, when taking off or putting it back on didn't feel perfect. They felt like they weren't lining up well and had me worrying about cross threading the screws or breaking the glass door. Once everything is lined up and back together though, everything feels solid. I still have 5 stars as these issues seem to be more of a feel issue than a function issue.

For starters this case has no true breathing room. i could more than likely use my system as a heater due to constricted fresh air intake. you cant add anymore than 4 total fans and personally im one of those that wants to get fresh air to my system even if i have to run them at full tilt and replace them every few years to make sure i don't put extra wear and tear on more expensive parts. it maybe just my way of thinking but i haven't had a system fail yet. thumb screws on it are TORKED DOWN.  i had to replace a few other screws due to stripping on them from factory.

The stock fan configuration of dual vent works well with a dual front intake, which supports a 240-280mm AIO rad, if so desired, and actually allots enough space to do a full push/pull 4 fans 280mm rad, which should be more than overkill for anything you'd build in a case this size.  It looks excellent, with a very minimalist approach with definitive boundries for each section that manages to make a spartan approach look refined vice cheap.  The tempered glass 3/4 panel is just enough to show off your hardware without being a full glass panel, or god forbid 4 full glass panels, as is found in many of the 'high end' and 'premium' try-hard cases.  The front IO is located at the front of the case on the top panel, which is the only acceptable place for front IO for anyone who isn't a masochist.  It features a single 3.5mm combo audio jack, but included in your case bundle is a splitter adapter for mic/headset so no worries there, an led lit power button, and 1 type C USB 3.1 gen 2 and 1 type A USB 3.1 gen 1 (thanks USB moderators forum...).  Basically you have 1 'normal' usb port and one 'ever-phone-but-apple' port, with the former capable of 5Gb/s transfer and the latter capable of 10Gb/s.  It's nice to see a type C, as it is one of the amenities oft reserved for those glassonglassonglass cases that cost twice the price of  this one, however 2 things to note are that:  for your type C 3.1gen2, you will need an accompanying connector on your motherboard, which is a toss up with anything older than x570 mobos, otherwise it's useless and, and the type a port uses a full motherboard 3.1 header, which usually supports two ports of it's variety.  My sollution was to dremel out the type c slot and throw in a double front type a, because I realized, as cool as having that high speed type C port is, do you know anyone who routinely has a type C male to male cable routinely on hand?  In all likelihood, that will the primary cable of use in the future with thunderbolt standards, display, and USB all unifying, but until then, it's just a pretty awkward port.   

...Also, this case isn't gigantic, which is important to me because I carry around a computer all day in my pocket, and I feel like there's no exuse for the giant heavy rigs of yesteryear.

You can always go with faster memory for ryzen but the difference between 3000mhz and 3200mhz isn't much in terms of performance gain and you'll usually end up spending a fair bit more.

It's been about 12 years since my last upgrade project, Modular wasn't even a thing we had back then.. In this case less is more.. My gaming PC is clutter free and everything looks so neat and organized, not having to figure out where 4 or 5 cables that will never be used just laying in the window display is great. Packaging was neat and organized. And the unit itself is a bit on the large side ,so be aware if your using a small atx case.

The fans don't even turn on until the temp goes past 50 C, and while on they are silent.

Mine came with Samsung memory (you can use GPUz to check your mem brand) so its rated to 2000 mhz (stock is 1938 mhz). So I did a mild overclock to 2000 mhz (which is the official rating), however other people have been able to add much more, even 1000 mhz more on some reviews, but I didn't need to push it that hight. I was able to push the core clock to +70 mhz, netting an around 2055 mhz on the core. All totally stable.

Power target can be pushed to +116% (to low for my taste, I hope Evga can produce an updated vbios with more power target, they did for the regular 2080's non-super) and 88 C on the temp target.

I came from a 1080  Ti so I thought the upgrade wasn't going to be much, but boy, was I wrong. I had trouble keeping consisting high frame rates on games (I have a 100 hz high refresh/high resolution 3440*1044 monitor) with it, but with this card, I hit 100+ fps on several games like rainbow six siege (ultra hd textures all maxed out) etc. Also, I can play ray tracing games now! Control is a beast!

Finally comes with a free code for COD modern warfare upcoming this 10/25 and it will have ray tracing too!

Highly recommend this card, the extra cuda cores, high clocks speed and overclockablity makes it a great upgrade over the 1080 Ti and approaches 2080 Ti territory without breaking the bank with $1200+!!"^5^Oct 11, 2019 4:07 PM

Bought this card for $800.  This card drives a 2560 x 1440 monitor at 144hz just fine.  Most of the games run at 144hz.  New AAA titles at ultra settings wont reach the 144hz.  The settings have to be adjusted and lowered.  The LED can be adjusted to match the current color scheme of the PC case.  It reads 'EVGA | GEFORCE RTX 2080.'  It can be run in SLI.  The card takes up 2.75 slots on the motherboard, because of the large cooler.  I had to use 3 slots and 3 screws to secure it.  When using the desktop the fans stop spinning.  They spin up during gaming but I have not noticed any noise so far.  It requires both a 6pin and 8pin connector, and needs at least a 650 Watt power supply.  You can register the card on EVGA and upload the invoice for the warranty.  The card booted up fine out of the box.

Went to BB and got this, the Corsair RM850x. A lot has changed since 2012. The cables, instead of looking like tentacles hanging out of the power supply, are now pluggable. I get to choose and pick only the cables I need, resulting in a cleaner internal PC case and better airflow.

GTA V, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Far Cry 5.  They all max this this card out with the eye candy cranked up, setting to high or very high improves performance significantly without a large drop in appearance compared to ultra settings.  Synthetic benchmarks see a large gain as well at default.

For those wondering if this is the founders edition, long story short to you guys. Yes, it is the card you see in the pictures and yes it's NVIDIAS version of the 2070 Super.

Performance: Plug and play, it works awesome even on ultra settings on games such as PUBG, RUST, and a few others, the GPU usage stays low and stays cool. Seems to have great ventilation. 

The only downside of this card is pretty much my fault. And that is that I have an i5-7600k and during some CPU intensive games, my CPU bottlenecks occasionally. But I do plan on upgrading my CPU to an i7 or i9 in the near future.

It gets the job done, and runs the game smoothly at around 60 FPS, and occasionally will dip to 45 FPS when lots of things are happening onscreen. Some people may find this disappointing, but I'm perfectly happy with that performance, especially considering the game looks phenomenal and is fun to boot.

This is probably not the best 'value' card, go with an ATI if you want that. But this is the best value for performance if you want to experience Ray Tracing, which depending on who you ask is either a waste of frames or the next generation of graphics technology. I'm definitely a fan, accurate reflections are now possible for the first time, and Control is a great game to experience this innovation with.

Kart^/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2070-super-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-3-0-graphics-card-black-silver/6361328?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^1^"There is a lot of discussion of price vs performance between RTX 2070 Super and RX 5700 XT. As an owner of both of these GPU's here is what you need to know. RX 5700XT is the value king, however the software is very little more buggy then Nvidia. 2070 Super runs 10-15% faster on most of my tests, but I have noticed that Nvidia drivers are better designed and lead to lower crashes. At the time of my purchase, I was able to use 10% off coupon from my birthday and also get a free copy of Modern Warfare. 

Design of the Founders Edition card is the best in the market. It has this high end apple like design and matched perfectly with my white and silver build. Coil whine is very minimal and this is one of the few 2 slot design cards on the market for 2070 Super.  

If you own GTX 1080, or 1070, performance should be 5-20% higher. Ray tracing is still a gimmick and it really kills a game's FPS performance when it turned on. Modern Warfare looks good, but I really can't tell big difference when RTX mode if ON or OFF. Nvidia also allows Gsync on free-sync enabled monitors, so that's another plus. 

If you are on the budget I would recommend getting RX 5700 and flashing the bios of RX 5700 XT. I was able to get a blower version of RX 5700 for $280 from bestbuy. If you do the math you are saving almost 45% for 10% performance drop. However, flashing the bios of your RX 5700 is a little bit risky, since you can brick the card if you DO NOT follow the procedures correctly. In my experience I have flashed 2 cars and they have been working perfectly."^4^Dec 15, 2019 2:05 AM

BWright92^/amd-ryzen-5-3600-six-core-3-6-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356278?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"In 2017, my i5 2500k from 2011 finally bit the dust - so I made an emergency upgrade. I went with the ASUS B350-F and a Ryzen 3 1300X. The 1300X held me over for a while, but I recently started to notice that it couldn't keep up with newer games, and bottlenecked my now dated GTX 970. 

I did some research and couldn't decide between the Ryzen 5 2600 and the 3600, but ultimately went with the 3600 and sold off my old 1300X to make up for the cost difference. This is a fantastic CPU, that has completely eliminated stuttering issues I experienced with my 1300X while gaming. My FPS have gone up, and this thing will pair so well with the AMD 5700 I plan to buy in the next few months.

ONE PROBLEM: The stock cooler (AMD Wraith Stealth) that comes with this CPU is bad. You HAVE to run it at 100% speed at all times to maintain good temps, at stock CPU speeds. I upgraded to the AMD Wraith Prism which works great."^5^Nov 23, 2019 8:48 AM

If you are upgrading and using a b350/x370 or b450/x470 motherboard, please be sure to check the manufacturer site for a bios update before you try to add your cpu in. It needs to update in order to recognize the new ryzen 3000 series.  After I did that, I had no issues.

The beautiful part about this cpu for me is it performs fantastic out of the box with little to no tweaking aside from prioritizing you're core utilization in the OS. No Integrated Graphics is a bummer but definitely not a deal breaker. 

Monitor you're motherboards QVL, Matisse CPU's are delicate,powerful and beautiful but ugly as hell if treated wrong lol.
I am currently running this cpu on a Rog Crosshair VI Hero with Best Buy purchased LPX Vengeance dual channel 2400Mhz. I first attempted this setup using LPX Vengeance dual channel 3000Mhz and I nearly lost my sanity dealing with the compatibility hiccups on this motherboard. If you have this board and are not considerably above average in OC experience I highly advise against the ladder ram speed. I literally heard an Asus engineer even advise against the use of 3000Mhz on the Ryzen 5/3600 Rog Crosshair VI Hero combo. The last bios update improved its compatibility slightly but the future initialization errors still persist. Go 2400Mhz or 3200Mhz."^5^Nov 22, 2019 4:37 PM

THE CARD REQUIRES TWO POWER CONNECTIONS TOO. The power supply I have is a 75 watt Cooler Master Gold supply that has probably 6 different power harnesses to choose from. The tech had to use one of my other harnesses so I had to go grab my power supply box with all the other configurations from home.
Now no problem with installing according to the tech. He also downloaded the latest drivers too.
The card is terrific and I can set everything to Ultra without a problem. The card purchase includes Call Of Duty Modern Warefare download when available in late October. This game has Ray Tracing which there are few games for now but should be more in 2020.
I have been playing Battlefield 4 and saw much more detail and noticed distant movements of players while being a sniper.
My only limitation is now my monitor because on the refresh rate of only 60hz. Much more expense monitors go up to 244hz but those are in the $1000.00 range. No thank you but when my monitor breaks then I will probably go to a 144hz in a couple of years from now depending on costs.
I know this isn't a cheap card but the 2070 card is just a dumbed down 2080 chipset. Unless you have a very high refresh rate monitor you really don't get all that the 2070 card can do.
Go buy the card but don't tell the wife because she will NOT understand unless she is a gamer too.
Now it's time to post my EVGA GTX 1070 Superclocked card on Ebay.
Important to register the card with EVGA and they also offer extended warranty options too.
Best Buy can offer them too so compare your options.
GO OUT AND BUY THAT CARD ALREADY!

So I wouldn't worry about the price tag given the performance and quality you are getting with this card. The EVGA 970 SSC I had previously was nice but this card is leaps and bounds better in fit and finish with all the bells and whistles included. You can tell this card means business and endure anything you throw at it. The metal bracket on the back is a really nice touch. Fan design is top notch. It also includes an LED logo. This card is a very solid and well constructed card and you won't feel like something bent or snapped off installing it. The giant heat sync keeps temps around 55C gaming and boosts are great at 1980mhz core and 1750mhz memory out of the box. The fans don't really need to engage that I can hear, so it's really quiet too. If you have a smaller case be sure it will fit because it's a very large card. It also needs more power than a 970 so be sure the power supply is up to it and have the correct power cabling. If your gaming at 1080P be sure to get a nice g-sync or free-sync monitor to take advantage of the increased frame rates as well. My only gripes are there are no converter cables included or case badges. So if you're coming from DVI-DL like me, you'll need one."^5^Oct 26, 2019 12:33 AM

I initially bought this exact same card directly from EVGA, but had to end up RMAing the video cad twice, because of way too much coil whine. Because coil whine isnt considered a defect by EVGA so I got hit with a restocking fee. Even though the tech at EVGA noted the coil whine, they just felt (very subjective here) that it fell within normal limits.

I purchased the card at my local BestBuy on sale, and the coil whine was remarkably less, almost inaudible. Thats that was only under high GPU strain. The card also appears to have been manufactured in 2020 (based of the serial number) verses the 2019 manufactured dates of the ones EVGA sent me.  But... the most important thing to note, if it would have had coil whine, I would have been easily able to exchange or return it that day, instead of the long back and forth of online purchases.

That said the card itself performs very well at 1440 resolutions with all the settings maxed. In my case the card never passes the high 60s for temp, and that is with an additional 100MHz OC above the default clock. Its also nice that this card is one of the shorter 2070 Supers out there. A lot of the 2070 Supers run over 300mm long. 

Also, Ray Tracing is kind of a disappointment. Maybe at 1080 resolutions its not big of a performance hit, but at 1440 resolutions its unplayable, unless you start turning down the graphics settings, which is defeats the point of having it in the first place.

Only thing to complain about other than whole hassle I had with EVGA, is that Nvidia has the RTX cards priced a little too high. While the RTX 2070 Super performs better than AMD RT 5700 XT by 5-7% its runs about 20% more in price."^5^Mar 25, 2020 2:14 PM

I'm more of what's called a 'casual gamer' though I am technical and proficient in custom PC builds and components. Upgraded from an eVGA 960 4gb to this 2070 super which is my first 70 series card ever. I'm truly blown away by its performance and quiet fans. Running at the stock clock speed so I haven't bothered to check temps but the fans seem pretty quiet under considerable load. By that I mean Metro Exodus running fully maxed ultra Settings including PhysX and Ray Tracing. The result is a smooth 60+ framerate (yes even with ray tracing) at 1440p. Though there is a bit of coil whine it doesn't bother me in the least. It's not thunderous or anything but it may slightly irritate extreme enthusiasts. I haven't tested 4k since I don't have access to a 4k monitor.

The price dropped by 50 bucks immediately after I bought it so if you can get it at 519 (current as of 12/31/2019) it's an absolute steal. If you don't care about ray tracing or running absolutely maxed out Settings on higher resolutions, you can probably get away with a 2060s for 100 cheaper but even for my casual gaming, I prefer this beast which chews up graphically intense games and spits out smooth high fps even with gorgeous ray tracing."^5^Dec 31, 2019 11:30 AM

I held out as long as I could, hoping I could get it working properly, but that wasn't to be.  It is a fast card--very fast, especially compared to the GTX 780 SC that it was supposed to replace.  I started with older games first that I am familiar with, running Tomb Raider 2013, and Rise of the Tomb Raider at 4K ultra, all settings maxed and turned on except for motion blur and film grain (which I do not like).  The benchmarks averaged around 58fps on each title, and in game, the frame rates were equally smooth and stable.  The issues I suffered were graphical and aural.  

Graphics issues - With Rise of the Tomb Raider, the card would occasionally freeze the onscreen graphics for a second or two, and at times, there would simply be a brief stutter.  It wasn't a once in a while thing--it would happen at least every 4-5 minutes.   My PC has sufficient cooling--3 120mm case fans, and no obstructions on any sides, and it's fairly dust-free.  I also use MSI Afterburner, to ensure the GPU's fans will speed up sufficiently as the temp increases, so there should not have been any issues there.  I have an eVGA 700 watt 80+ power supply, so power was not an issue.  I briefly tried out Metro Exodus, also in 4K, and with all settings maxed out, the frame rate was reasonably smooth, with demanding portions dropping to roughly 45 fps, but in the benchmarks, the average was 50 fps.  For whatever reason, the card must have been overly taxed with Rise of the Tomb Raider, and because of the issues, I didn't bother testing Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which is even more graphic intensive. 

Sound Issues - for my 4K gaming, I use the GPU's built in audio processor, routed through a Pioneer Elite VSX-LX503 receiver.  When starting any audio track such as a YouTube video, or a music file, there is always a 2-second delay at the start.  The audio isn't misaligned with any onscreen video, it just takes 2 seconds for the audio to be heard.  This is a huge issue when playing a music playlist, as the 1st two seconds of every single song would be silent.  If the only issue were with Rise of the Tomb Raider, I could live with it--I've already played the game 3 times anyways, but the audio issue was unforgivable.  I tried using both HDMI ports and the DisplayPort, but it didn't matter; the issue never improved or disappeared.  

So sadly, as much as I enjoyed the immense speed increase, I just couldn't keep the card and deal with the audio/visual problems.  I imagine I just got a faulty one, but I'll keep researching and consider possibly a different card just to be on the safe side.  More than likely, most people will be over the moon with the performance that the 2070 Super XC ULtra provides."^4^Jan 19, 2020 5:59 PM

I installed it, it seemed to work great for about 3hrs. Then my laptop went into a failure screen I have never seen before. My laptop tried for hours to 'fix the problem'.

I really need to get a 8gb ram for my HP laptop to help me with my multitasking programs. I don't know what to do now.
I gave this 2 stars because it worked for 3hrs, the salesman was honest (5 stars there) and returning it was a breeze (5 stars).

If you are decidinf if you need an upgrade, windows 10 with a few chrome tabs sits at about 5-6GB easy, so 8GB these days looks minimum. Also consider a integrated card that would take some of that RAM as well. 16GB is the safer bet and provides some longevity. Ram specs wise: just make sure you are getting the max supported (speeds) on your device, this is quite useful to get the best performance; especially in the case on integrated GPU's. Also dual channel is a good ideal when possible, could eke out a few extra % of performance, I understand a lot of AMD setups really thrive on this. Also if you can get a pair from the same batch, usually via those pair deals it's apparently the best choice, however if all specs of the new ram match the others, you should be all good. Of course brand, frequency, timings or voltage etc matching would be your best best, but even when they don't match; thing should be fine but you would run at the slowest ram specs. Installing them on most laptops is pretty straight forward but you might needs a few tools (special screwdriver kit) to not end up damaging screw threads and other bits on your laptop. Google your device and most videos out there show what's needed. Just make sure your ram is not soldered, than there is nothing you could do, some laptops do leave one spare slot with one soldered combo though."^5^Jun 24, 2019 11:55 PM

Mezzerto^/amd-ryzen-7-3700x-octa-core-3-6-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356277?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"I was an AMD guy 10 years ago and eventually migrated to Intel for gaming. Well... after rave reviews, I tried AMD again and have not been disappointed. While Intel's 9700k and 9900k out performed this CPU in over all FPS, it was typically only by single digits in most games. In Cinebench r20, my 3700x out scored my friends 9900k in multi-core processing power. That result isn't typical, but it shows how close these chips really are, and the 3700x is available at a much lower price point.

But... what does that mean to you? Overall this means that Intel chips are slightly better for just gaming today but if you do just about anything else in addition to gaming or other than gaming... You should really consider AMD and it's new line of processors unless you're willing to pay the premium for Intel's 9900k for extremely small gains."^5^Oct 18, 2019 4:12 PM

ITJIm^/amd-ryzen-7-3700x-octa-core-3-6-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356277?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"Earlier this year I replaced a 7 year old, intel focused, custom built computer with something more modern.  I replaced it with an Asus ROG Strix B450-F AM4 motherboard.  Outfitted her with 32GB or memory, 1TB SSD, and a Ryzen 5 2400G processor.  At the time, the Ryzen 5 was cheap and suited my current needs.  I also had a plan to replace this processor as soon as the third generation Ryzen processors hit the market.  Glad I did.

Installation was fairly simple.  First, I updated the system BIOS with the latest from Asus.  The update took about 20 minutes.  Execution was flawless.  I then reset all Bios settings to factory defaults.  Saved, allowed the system to power cycle one more time.  Then shut everything down.

Second, I unplugged the PSU cable, attached my anti-static wrist band and clipped it to a metal bit on the computer case, and removed my Corsair Hydro H-55 cooler.  I chose not to use the included Wraith Prism air cooler.  The heat sink, fan, and LED lights do look cool.  However, my system has a very clean look now and I felt that adding a giant heatsink and fan would disrupt my case's Feng Shui.

The 2400G popped out of the AM4 socket and the 3700X popped in.  I added a pea sized bead of thermal compound and re-installed the cooler.  I powered up the system, the Bios throw a warming, I reset the system defaults, and within seconds I was in Windows.  

I was able to clock my memory to their factory specified clocks without any issue.  Games are super fast.  Must faster than on my 2400G.  The 2400G is a bottleneck for any game that requires high single core performance.  Older games mostly.  The 3700X really ups its game here.  Gaming has been fantastic.  Mechwarrior Online, a CryEngine 3 game that is CPU bound, plays on par with an Intel 7 9700 CPU.  More on that in a minute.

I did find a few instances where the 3700X struggled in gaming.  Again, both very old games.  Supreme Commander 2 is a CPU, single core limited, RTS.  I noticed that when the unit limits are reached and armies are in full scale engagements then the game will stutter a bit.  Nothing that really slowed the game down.  Just annoying.  

I also ran into some issues with Star Wars Empire at War.  In all fairness, I was playing this game with a graphics, sound, and special effects mod that really ground the game to a halt when a mighty capital ship exploded.  The special effects simply took over the system with hyper-real primary explosions, secondary explosions, debris falling away from the doomed ship, and the animation of the ship itself breaking apart, spinning out of control, and sinking away, like an ocean ship, into the background of the map.  There were a lot of physics here for a game engine never designed for this type of work.  Ryzen did handle it with a single thread pegged at 100%, got through it, and the game continued.  

Other than these two instances, gaming has been a dream with this new CPU.

So, let's talk about the Intel i7-9700.  My daughter has an Intel based computer with this processor.  I chose to run some benchmarks too compare the two.  

3D Mark Time Spy: 

AMD 2400G - 5,474 
AMD 3700X - 6,609
Intel 9700 - 6,191

PCMark10:

AMD 2400G - 3,693 
AMD 3700X - 6,269
Intel 9700 - 5,829

SuperPosition:

AMD 3700X - 8,600
Intel 9700 - 8,577

Overall, I am getting as good with the Ryzen 3700X as my daughter is getting with her Intel i7 97000.  I am very happy I went with AMD for my future proof mainline computer system.  Gaming is great and productivity is fantastic."^5^Aug 4, 2019 9:58 AM

You don't care about or need my life story.....but.
Started with 1800X and RED build. ZEN and Intel was annoying me with Tick Tok, and no real innovation since 2004.

Gave that 1800X to my daughter for her college RIG.
I stepped up to 2700X. Bee's knees and beast.

Some research later, I pulled the trigger today on the 3700X.
3700X - BLOWS away my 2700X in temps (lower TDP) and performance and 'snappy,' behavior. It's sick, really. I WAS going to go for 3900X, but it's a lot more money and cores than I need. And it's binned lower, I hear.

Maybe I won the silicon lottery, but this thing is beast. 100% load she runs at 70C tops and fans barely spin up. I am under AIO water.

2700X probably going to my son.

BUY THIS PROCESSOR and you WILL NOT be disappointed.

Lastly, SUPPORT local shops. AMZN can GTFO. Same price and got it today, and they won't have stock for weeks.

This things blows out of the park when it comes to work load performance. Also this thing is very good in gaming and Single core performance did increase from Ryzen 2700x.
As far as Overclocking i am able to get it to 4.4ghz paired with Corsair RGb 3200mhz Ram. I would not go on anything slower Ram wise Since Ryzen get's huge improvement on a faster Ram!

I upgraded an existing AMD X370 chipset motherboard with this 3700X CPU, upgrading from a Ryzen 7 1800X chip. No issues with my existing Windows 10 installation so far, and everything has sped up - some things by as much as 100%! I seem to have less overall power usage also. I'm only getting a little under 4.2GHz boost clocks though, with maximum temperature under load around 68C. Not sure why the lower clocks. Nice to have something more competitive from AMD again though!

Make sure your memory is compatible with this processor and your board so you don't have any issues. Coming from intel my entire life I think saying I was nervous about this purchase was an understatement. I really liked what AMD was doing with this chip, really pushing things in a new direction.

The faster your memory the better, these new chips like fast memory a lot. They also are very dependent on cooling. The better your cooling solution is the faster this processor will go, without you having to do anything other than install a better cooler. The processor automatically adapts to how well its being cooled and overlocks itself.

If you're seeing a higher than normal voltage at stock/auto settings that is absolutely normal. When a program like hwinfo/cpuz reads the voltage it sometimes gets the last peak voltage it was at because the core that its polling is possibly asleep so amd won't let it poll the live voltage because that would wake it up."^5^Sep 9, 2019 11:03 AM
TopBun^/amd-ryzen-7-3700x-octa-core-3-6-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356277?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"slotting this thing into a x470 board may be a little much for those less experienced PC enthusiasts, but otherwise installation is a breeze and works beautifully out of the box. AMDs precisionboost overdrive does a mighty good job of getting the most performance out of this chip with no fiddling in the bios, though if youre so inclined you can tinker a bit with the maximum boost allowed to PBO. the extra performance over the 2700x is definitely real and nothing to sneeze at by any means, but even if it wasnt a marked improvement, the energy savings alone is amazing. i would consistently pull over 110w with the 2700x bit with the 3700x i never pull much over 80w if i hit 80w at all. 

another fantastic improvement with this architecture is the DRAM compatibility as well as the improved ability to overclock your DRAM. same 3200 14c kit i had with the 2700x (amd was never able to get to post past 3200mhz) i was easily able to push to 3600mhz no sweat.

Single thread is much faster in all tasks.  Multi-core is the fastest there is core for core with Ryzen 3000.  Leave all other comparable cpus behind in multi core workloads.  Gaming is fast as well but you won't see a difference in 4k or 2k as that is to be expected.  If you have this paired with a 500$ gpu or higher you won't see a bottleneck.  I recommend fast Samsung B-Die Night Legend CL 3200 mhz or higher memory for Ryzen.

Paired with an rtx 2070 super graphics card, this runs everything I have so far at the absolute best detail 1080p and probably 1440p too at a slight decrease in quality. The amount of threads has made multitasking nothing. Probably the best deal without going crazy on something like a Ryzen 9 3900x or something. Plus keep in mind this uses the same motherboard architecture as it's 1000 and 2000 counnterparts so with a bios upgrade, the older boards for those should work fine. I don't do overclocking however as I like my parts to last longer this way, so do keep tha in mind. Final note is the cooler that it comes with is impressive.

The 2700x is a great processor!'  This is a true statement... however simply put - this 3700x is a substantial upgrade over even the 2700x!   For starters... it uses FAR less power and yet generates substantially better performance!  I re-used my x470 motherboard from the 2700x... and with this processor at stock - it will NOT draw over 90-watts through the socket.  The 2700x stock was around 130-watts... but I had Precision Boost Overdrive enabled - so it drew closer to 170-watts!  That's nearly half the power savings with the 3700x, yet with 20% or more performance in every category.

Oh - and in terms of thermal performance - this processor is EXTREMELY intelligent as well.  I run it under a Noctua NH-D15... and since that cooler is upgraded over what it comes with - it allows the processor to self-overclock and give me all-core averages of around 4.25GHz while intense gaming... and temps around 60-degrees celcius or so.  Stress testing never gets over around 63-65 degrees.

Worth EVERY penny... even for someone who may have last year's 2600x or 2700x.  Upgrade to this - sell your last one on eBay.  You may be out $150 or so, but if you're even still reading this review then you know $150 isn't much for this kind of upgrade.

photofrankFM^/amd-ryzen-7-3700x-octa-core-3-6-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356277?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"This is for the AMD Ryzen 7 3700 X 65 watt 8 core 3.6 Ghz CPU. First of all I am not sure why they rate it at 3.6 Ghz as it will boost to 4.4 Ghz for a short duration and then settle in at a constant 4.1 to 4.27 depending on your board and how agressively you set the boost level in the BIOS. I got it to run at almost 4.4 under constant boost, but it crashed after a restart and when I tried to go higher than 4.4 it won't boot. I am not the greatest overclocker, but my experience has been the normal for many review sites who are expert overclockers. 

The concensus is that AMD built this to come out of the box with all guns blazing and the fact that it is a 65 watt CPU doesn't give it as much overhead as a 105 watt Ryzen. Note: it is rated at 65 watt TDP, but that is at 3.6 Ghz. When running a brutal stress test such as Furmarks CPU Burner it will pull 11 plus watts per core and a total of as much as 111 watts for the whole package. Thus the reason that it has such a high sustained boost, is that AMD has given it the fuel it needs to do that, and therefore trying to overclock this fast out the gate horse is really not going to be worth the effort. Having said that it is an economically efficient CPU. Under normal production usage it constantly pegs needed cores at 4.4 Ghz while pulling about 50-55 watts and will run at about 30 watts under light usage.  

With that said it is a strong performer. I bought it because I need all the speed I can get out of Photoshop and it delivers. I paired it with an X570 board with a 1 TB PCIe 4.0 M.2, 512 GB PCIe 3.0 M.2, two 1 TB SATA SSDs,three 4TB HDDS and 3 external drive HDDs. I have 32 GBs of DDR4 3200 RAM, an RTX 2060 Super and a 750 Watt Bronze 80 Power Supply. For those who only have one 8 Pin CPU power cable on your PS, don't worry about X570 boards having an 8 pin and 4 pin CPU plug. It runs just fine with just the 8 pin plug.

I didn't try the Wraith heatsink. I installed a 240mm AIO liquid cooler. I have it in a well ventilated case that is in a compartment in my work desk and it runs at 40 degrees C at idle, about 55 in Photoshop. It holds 63 degrees C in Prime 95 and 70 degrees C in Furmarks CPU Burner. 

How does it perform? I have a unit with an i7 9700 with 32 GBs of RAM and an RTX 2080 Super. Running Puget Systems Photoshop benchmark test it posts an average score of 860 points. I pulled the 2080 out of it and put it in the new build with the Ryzen 3700 X as GPU performance influences the test. I need to note that the PCie 4.0 capability of the 3700 X with my PCIe 4.0 M.2 and the X570 board registers a 5500 MB/s SSD read speed vs the 3300 MB/s read of the PCIe 3.0 of the i7 system and that probably had some benefit. Running the same Puget Systems benchmark the Ryzen 3700 X system scored 967 points.

This is the most responsive system that I have had to date. My previous systems have been an i7 6700K and an i7 9700.

So I think that this is a great bang for buck CPU, especially if you are willing to use the included Wraith Cooler, but I think in order to really get the full advantage of the 3700 X you need to leverage all of it's potential by putting it on an X570 board with a PCIe 4.0 M.2."^5^Feb 1, 2020 3:40 PM

Although Intel does not want us to know that with misleading and false claims that the Intel's CPUs are better, a number of Intel claims of superiority has been proven as outright deception and falsehoods by crippling the AMD CPUs in comparison tests. UserBenchmark is an example.  Ther test shows the Intel as only 1% faster than the AMD, but their test scores only weight the multi-core performance as 2% of the overall score.

Earlier this year, Intel showcased their TOTL CPUs at a show only to fail in disclosing that their CPU was highly overclocked and cooled by an illegal cooling system the size of an ice chest.

In another comparison, the Intel was show as superior to an AMD CPU by discretely disabling half of the AMD cores.  They also claim that any software test suites that shows AMD as superior as being biased toward AMD, but also accepting those same suites if the Intel is shown as superior.

I used to have an Intel i7-8700K and replaced it with the AMD 3700X.  The AMD 3700X has eight cores and 16 threads.  The Intel has six cores and 12 threads.  While the Intel has a faster CPU, the higher number of cores in the AMD shows that the AMD is about 48% faster than the Intel when using all the cores.

Since the Intel has a faster CPU, apps that use only single-cores (such as most games) will be slightly faster than the AMD.  In this case, by a couple of per cent.

Since I do video transcoding, the 3700x has shown to be over 20% faster than the i7-8700K.  In all other applications, i find the AMD much more than adequate over the Intel i7-8700K,"^5^Jan 3, 2020 7:33 PM

Andrew^/amd-ryzen-7-3700x-octa-core-3-6-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356277?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"My journey with Ryzen started with a first gen Ryzen 5 1600.   I believe that it was considered the best cost to performance CPU later that year by a lot of the 'experts'.  I upgraded to the Ryzen 7 2700X as soon as it was released because I was still having some issues playing in VR and I had upgraded to a 2080ti and was CPU bottlenecked (much to no one's surprise).  It was a good chip as well....basically updated the firmware and chipset drivers and I was off and running.  It was obviously a massive improvement in performance.  Still CPU bottlenecked in a few racing sims.  Not bad, but not perfect.  So about 15 minutes after the 2700X was released they came out with the 3rd Generation Ryzen 2 CPU's which was obviously an effort to confuse the consumers out there.  Now most of the 'experts' have proclaimed the 3600 as the best performance for cost and they are probably correct.  I wasn't looking for an improvement in performance; I was looking to attain a specific level of performance and the 3600 may or may not have gotten me there.  The 3700X got me there.  

It may not be the best bang for your buck because the 3600 is such an amazing deal, but if you need a specific level of performance AND you have an AM4 motherboard (I'm still rocking an X370 chipset) and have decent ram.....well, it's money well spent and a great value in my opinion.  The fact that I've been able to upgrade twice now without having to completely rip everything out of the case to install a new MB can't be overlooked.  A decent MB is going to run you at least $120 and that's if you get lucky.  The amount of performance that I've been able to get through a simple BIOS flash and a new CPU from just two years ago is staggering.

Now if I was building from scratch I don't know if I'd go with a Ryzen right now.  The AM4 socket was supposed to be usable for 4 years I believe and we're getting kind of close to the end of that road.  Alternatively Intel is kind of known for changing sockets with every major release and forcing owners to a more expensive upgrade path.  So basically the next gen of everything may involve a MB upgrade anyway so I wouldn't use that as my deciding factor.  I will say that AMD stuck to their promise about the AM4 being compatible though.  It's still not completely mature as they are allegedly still tweaking the BIOS to get the clocks to boost to the advertised speeds more often (irritating, but in real life performance I haven't had an issue).  Other than the tweaks it's been a rock solid platform ever since they sorted out the ram timing issues with gen 1 CPU's. 

Oh, it's also only rated as a 65W TDP chip so you heat hasn't been an issue for me.  I was able to run it on a 140mm AIO without ever getting close to max temps.  I did upgrade to a 280mm AIO recently because I found one on sale, but it was more about replacing it before the old one failed than needing it.

Bottom line is that it's a great platform, it's a great CPU, but figure out what it is that you are trying to do and determine whether you need higher frequency clock speeds or more cores to get to the level of performance in your use case and then pick the appropriate CPU.  There really isn't a 'bad' CPU out there today, it just depends on what you are trying to do.  For the number of cores and performance the 3700X fit my needs very well.  I can't complain about the price at all."^5^Sep 6, 2019 5:20 PM

While this won't get you the highest possible FPS in gaming, the utility is so much higher than a comparably priced Intel processor, with more cores and thread for productivity.

The only bad part is that being an early adopter, there are still BIOS and driver issues and additional refinement that AMD needs to make in order to make this a more polished product.

Additionally, the density of this 7nm part makes it heat up extremely quickly, even though it has a relatively low TDP. The included cooler is fine, although I recommend an aftermarket one for better cooling and more quiet operation."^5^Sep 6, 2019 4:09 PM

I chose this CPU because it has a great price/performance ratio and I wanted to better 'future-proof' my build with the extra cores/threads versus comparable Intel options.

I've paired this with an x570 motherboard (MSI Gaming Edge WiFi) and 16 GB of AMD optimized 3200 DDR4 C16 memory (with XMP profile 1 enabled to hit 3200 Mhz), and performance has been fantastic. The stock fan does an okay (but not great) job keeping temps down, its RGB is lovely and I haven't had any issues with noise.

Bottom line, this is a great CPU for 1440p 144hz gaming, even without CPU overclocking or upgrading the stock fan."^5^Aug 23, 2019 12:37 PM

This was obviously a fast system, but I had purchased two 8GB sticks of DDR4-3600 memory from G. Skill that were very problematic in the system for some time.  At best, I could reliably run it at DDR4-3200, and that's about it.  

After extensive BIOS updates, I went and swapped my 2700X for the 3700X I purchased from Best Buy.  Aside from certain situations being *visibly* faster than before, my memory now works like a charm at DDR4-3600.  Not only that, but all the strange quirks I couldn't figure out in the past all went away.  I may decide to get a new motherboard in the future if I perhaps want to replace my NVMe drive with a new PCIe 4-based one, but I don't want to do that now.

If anyone is wondering whether they should replace their board or not, I can confidently say that you can wait if you wish.

Just to clarify from a concern I had when shopping in the B450 Range.

Wow, what a monster for the price; 
I had moderate expectations for the price of this board, but I have been absolutely blown away at every turn.

I currently have:
A Ryzen 7 2700X stable at 4.25 running 1.43V
2 16gb Trident Z Royal 3000mhz ocd to 3400mhz
( 16 18 18 36)
An EVGA RTX 2080Ti XC Ultra at 2100 core and 8000 mem.

and this board seemingly does not care one bit in terms of VRM temps. Its taken me roughly a month of tinkering in the bios to really get all of those numbers toned in exactly right, and potentially a more capable VRM solution may have aided in that, but you cannot expect anymore than this for the price.

-It is a true full ATX mobo with 2 full speed Gen 3 NVME slots
-multiple (dont know exactly) Sata ports
- RIGID PCIE slots, absolutely zero sag on the Ti without any additional mounting support. 
-Bios provides every entry and mid level OC option for Ryzen, even if the capabilities of the chips are now more automatic than manual. It is simply a stunning value compared to the premium most (including Asus) charge for a 570 chipset.

I loved having the ability to go to a BIG box store, like BestBuy, and gazing upon all the computer components they have in the store, and they have roughly the cheapest prices around. 
I did have ONE issue with this motherboard. Upon installing RAM, CPU & cooler, and m.2 NVMe SSD, I installed it into the case (Corsair 100r), I booted to BIOS with no issues. I stepped away for 5 minutes and the computer shut down. When I pressed the power button, it practically blinked, all the fans turned on, and then immediately turned off. After 1.5-2 hours of diagnostics, I've come to the conclusion that the Mobo was shot. EVEN though the ROG IO RGB was illuminating and working. I checked every component starting with the CPU, and RAM only, still got the issue. The funny thing is I have 3 LED indicator lights for diagnostics, none of them showed errors.
Spoke with ASUS customer support at 8 p.m. on a Monday night, and got a person on the phone at 8:05 p.m. I told him all that I have done and he said that unfortunately those were the procedures he recommends doing before filing a warranty. He then gave me a case number and told me to take it back to BestBuy and get it exchanged.
So, I ended up boxing both the PSU and the Mobo up and I took them back to my local BestBuy (after they got a new one in stock (5 business days)). I even made sure to pack all the SATA and power cables, and made thepackages all nice and neat and BestBuy employees didn't LOOK INSIDE. Oh well, they exchanged them, and as soon as I got home, I bench built the Mobo back again on its box, starting with CPU and RAM, and EVERYTHING WORKS! So far, 2 weeks in, everything works great!

The first week I had this motherboard, I started getting some blue screen errors. Maybe things just needed an update, yet after that, they kept occurring. The second thing I tried doing was reinstalling Windows. . . except that wouldn't work at all. Everything else was working the way it was supposed to, so at this point, I had the cause narrowed down to this motherboard.

I swapped it out for a different brand (and higher model), and everything worked fine afterwards.

Only reasons I give this a two instead of a one is because it looked nice and because it at least tried to fight the errors to work, even if it lost in the end.

Of course, this could've just been my unit, however, after looking into things a bit more, a lot of people have had issues with this exact board in very similar situations.

So, purchase at your own risk, but personally, I'd recommend getting a different one, whether it's from ASUS (as they do make great boards), or another manufacturer."^2^Sep 27, 2019 9:42 AM

My last build was about 3 years ago and I made multiple trips to and from store from where I bought the MB. This was an easy build with respect to the MB and processor. I chose to buy the MB & Processor from Bestbuy instead Craigslist knowing that I could easily return the board within 15 days. The whole process went very smoothly with the only hitch being that I had a very old power supply that didn't have the 8 pin connector. This was an easy fix. I purchased an adapter after which the computer booted up. I paired the MB with a i5 9600k processor. Super fast system. The only issue I had with this build was that the Radeon Vega 56 Graphic Card I chose required more power than what my 500 watt PSU could provide. The system would shut down and restart when doing anything that taxed the the card. I was hoping the problem was my power supply, though was worried that the card may be defective as I bought it off of CL for $180, which is really cheap for this card. I headed to Bestbuy and spoke to an employee that worked in the DIY pc section. He asked all of the right questions and provided a sensible explanation for the issue that I was having and helped me choose a new PSU. He was right and the new PSU solved my problem. What I like about purchasing from Bestbuy is their return policy. They make the whole process easy. This is huge as I've been building computers for over 20 years and have bought many pc components that were either defective or didn't pair well with other hardware. Amazon is cheap and they have a huge selection, though returns are a pain and Bestbuy will price match them as long as the product is sold by Amazon. I've found that Bestbuy is selective in what MBs they carry and it appears that they stay away from MBs that are of poor quality.

Meiru^/corsair-ll-series-120mm-case-cooling-fan-kit-with-rgb-lighting/6181283?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^9^1^"The three fans connected perfectly within my computer case. I paired these fans with some Corsair lighting strips for an RBG build. When I booted up the computer, I was pleasantly surprised about how nice the lighting on the fan was compared to the HD120's. Definitely a lot smoother and fluid. Then I installed Corsair Lin-- I mean 'iCUE'

Oh boy. The lighting options were alright. Nothing too fancy, pretty much the same stuff compared to the HD120's. Again, I really like the colors and the style of the fans. Shortly, I began to have problems, however. Starting up my PC sometimes causes the fans to not activate into the lighting mode that I set it to. Instead, it glitches and blinks its default rainbow setting. What's odd is that the lightstrips are fine, it's just the fans that are flickering. Additionally, sometimes iCUE can't even detect that anything's connected to my lighting node pro (which comes included with the fans, nice touch).

Overall, very beautiful fans. The RBG looks terrific; Corsair really stepped up their game. Unfortunately, the software that handles the lighting needs some work. Hopefully we got some updates in the future to alleviate some of these problems. For now, the fans are a solid buy, but it's mildly tough to justify the hefty price tag considering the software in its current state."^4^Jun 21, 2018 12:02 PM

So I bit the bullet and purchased these fans just so I can get some RGB lighting on my build. Wow! These changed the total appearance of my system. The LED's are bright and vibrant. The amount of control you can get with the software make the fans a light show by themselves. Corsair has always produced quality products and this is no exception. They are quiet, respond to speed changes dictated by the motherboard's temperature curves. Here are few suggestions, however. It would have been nice for cable management purposes if the LEDs and fan control wires could be daisy-chained. I would have liked to see a subtle arrow showing which way the fan moved the air so I can install them for push or pull correctly the first time. The orientation of the fans can also use a little help as some of the lighting patterns require them to be turned in a certain way. This caused some trial and error before I got it turned the right way."^5^Dec 5, 2018 11:40 AM

Kind of requires you to be invested in their product economy however. Each fan still needs to be connected into a fan header/fan hub. The Lighting Node Pro in the box is purely for lighting.

Pictures and videos really don't do it justice. The fans are very bright and colorful. They also provide great *case* airflow. They're average at best when it comes to cooling a radiator. As far as noise, you're going to have to configure your own fan curve. CUE's default settings have these running at unnecessarily high RPM. Mine hover from 600-1000 RPM(which still keep my CPU/GPU nice and cool) and I can't hear them through my earbuds.
The rear/exhaust side is not as illuminated as the front of the fan where the LED ring sits. If you're going to be using these as a front intake, you won't be seeing much of your lighting.

If you already have a few Corsair RGB products, these will accompany them well. If you're not, I recommend looking at other (much cheaper) options."^5^Dec 21, 2018 7:38 PM

I was on a budget but I didn't want to be too cheap and then I came across this fairly priced motherboard. If you want a short answer this is a really good motherboard with some great features and benefits and can not be beat for the price.  

One of the things that I really appreciated about this motherboard is the preinstalled IO Shield it made installation a breeze and is a great for first time pc builders. The motherboard features wifi and bluetooth which is great for the price. I wish it was Wifi 6 but regardless its nice to even have wifi.It does have some RGB feature on which is minimal but honestly I didn't mind at all. RAM was interesting situation the initial speed was around 2200 MHz but when I messed around with it and enabled XMP my corsair 3200 MHz was working perfectly fine. One thing I did not enjoy was the location of the fan headers, they are near the bottom and may be awkward for some or difficult to reach. Lets break down some of the pros and cons
PRO
-Pre installed IO Shield
-WIFI Bluetooth
-USB C
-BIOS updating 
-Quiet motherboard
-PCIe 4.0 almost all slots with Ryzen 3rd Gen 3600 and above

CON
-IO Shield is lackluster 
-Fan headers placement 
-Slight RAM issues (just takes a little of messing around to fix it)
- No WIFI 6
-Chipset Fan (sigh)

Conclusion- The MSI X570 Gaming Edge is a great Mid Range motherboard with some great features and a competitive price. Most of the issues that I have encountered have resolutions that just take some time. The motherboard just like most MSI products is a great combination of quality and value. I recommend this motherboard especially with the 3rd Gen Ryzen in particular anything above the 3600."^4^Jul 13, 2019 12:49 AM
KevinK^/msi-mpg-x570-gaming-edge-wifi-socket-am4-usb-c-gen2-amd-motherboard/6357223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^0^"I built my first pc, waiting for the new AMD Ryzen Zen 2 processors. I picked up the Ryzen 5 3600 for my first build along with the MSI X570 Gaming Edge. The motherboard has great features for this low of a price-point especially among the other X570 boards. If you want to save some few-extra bucks for a better gpu/cpu or other parts, I highly recommend the MSI X570 Gaming Edge!

Many benefits for the MSI X570 Gaming Edge include the preinstalled IO Shield making installation a breeze and saving a little time and is a great for first time pc builders. The motherboard has Wifi and Bluetooth which is great for the price. It has minimal RGB features which is fine since I have other RGB. You have to go to BIOS to set your RAM to the frequency which you bought it at since the motherboard sets it lower. One thing that may be difficult for other users are the location of the fan headers which are on the bottom of the motherboard and may be hard for others to reach. Other pros/cons listed below.

PRO
- Pre installed IO Shield (Don't have to struggle like previous generations of boards)
- Wifi & Bluetooth (Saves you time, money and worriment rather than getting a third party USB for either Wifi or Bluetooth that you may not know a lot about)
- Has BIOS flashback for future updates
- RGB is minimal, but is what you get for at this pricepoint
- Overclocking is easy, especially for a first time pc- builder like me.
- 2 M.2 slots.
- Many SATA ports 

CON
- Heat sink is a tight fit for my case (NZXT H500) since its right next to the fans.
- Fan headers placement could be a little better since they are all on bottom, but for me it wasn't too bad since my fans (Corsair LL120) had long cables. 
- Need to go into BIOS to set RAM to desired speed which you bought since the BIOS sets it to a lower frequency.  

I recommend pairing this board with a AMD Ryzen Zen 2 (third gen) processor due to the ease of installing the board with easy overclocking for first-time builders since this is probably the best motherboard you can get around this price point for the features and ease of use."^5^Jul 30, 2019 3:11 PM
kenny^/msi-mpg-x570-gaming-edge-wifi-socket-am4-usb-c-gen2-amd-motherboard/6357223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"I paired the MSI x570 Gaming Edge Wifi Motherboard with a AMD Ryzen 3700X, Gigabyte RTX 2080 Windforce, two WD Black 512GB M.2 SSD's, Seagate Firecuda 2TB, and 2 sticks of corsair vengence pro rgb. My final build is nothing short of amazing in performance and looks! However, I found the setup to be quite tedious. While I would recommend this board to anyone, it was not a five star experience.. 

Overall, the build was very easy. It should be noted, that although I have done months of in depth study, this was in fact my first build. I was able to quickly find headers for nearly everything, and the manual helped me find anything that wasn't immediately apparent. The fan header placement could be better. All four are along the bottom of the case which means that if you don't want fan cables running across the face of your build, you will have to get extensions.. Some people have even complained that it has been too far for some fans to run.. It did however look ascetically pleasing once I managed my cables though.. The motherboard fit in my mid tower, ATX case and was very sturdy even with a massive RTX 2080 hanging off of it. I think its important to note that I bought mine within just a few weeks after launch and yet my board had no major defects other than what appeared to be a few paint or glue splotches..(Most of them are out of sight but you can kinda see one in the 3rd photo) 

Initially after boot, everything seemed to be working well. The bios was easy to navigate and most settings were straightforward. However, I had many struggles with trying to install windows on my raid drive. The windows installer just couldn't see the raid array, even after using the drivers on the disk. Just after midnight on the second day of trying to get RAID to work, I figured out that if I unplugged all other drives before booting, then recreated the raid array, booted to windows installer, installed drivers from the MSI website; it then suddenly just worked.. 

After that whole ordeal, everything has gone rather smoothly. My only other gripe with this board is the Dragon Center. I originally installed the version that came on the disc and it was horrible.. Old and clunky and only worked half the time. My RAM RGB often does whatever it feels like or uses a setting I set days before.. Finally getting tired of it all, I tried to install iCUE to see if it would work with my board. During the process I uninstalled the dragon center. When I re-downloaded the Dragon Center from the website this time(because iCUE didn't do what I wanted..) it was completely different.. And Faster.. And just all around works better.. So don't trust the included on disc software! Get it from the website!

So that is everything that I have disliked about the MSI experience; they could do much better with software.. The board itself is amazing. As a video editor and gamer, I frequently copy files to external drives. I love the amount of fast IO on this motherboard especially when compared to any other x570 motherboard at this price point. It is so fast that when transfering a 1GB file to my WD Passport SSD, the transfer window just flashes and its done.. Like no waiting at all! 

The WIFI is a great feature. I have yet to test its effective speed because my internet is pretty slow, but I haven't had any drops and it has been consistent. I didn't even add the antennas for a few days after building and it worked fine!

I have yet to hear the chipset fan over the rest of my fans which are all very quite as well. 

This motherboard also has great RGB control with 2 ARGB and 2 12vRGB headers. The Mystic lighting software has a little way to go but other than that its great!

I came to this motherboard grudgingly after accepting that a comparable ASUS motherboard would be too expensive.. However, I would now give a 99% recommendation to a friend who was looking for an X570 board just because past setup, there is no other current X570 motherboard at this price point with the IO and performance of this one. The performance per dollar of this board is just as good as can be. So good job MSI."^4^Jul 28, 2019 8:26 PM

Out of the box, connected everything, immediately went to BIOS and turned on A-XMP to get the RAM at 3200, Rebooted and the RAM was at 3200!

RGB thoughts: I am not big on RGB, so I like how the board has a simple 'Ground effect' RGB that comes from under the board (See the white light in Picture 2).

Everything worked together perfectly, and the only hitch I had, was I accidentally set my Windows account to standard and not administrator. This caused most of the MSI programs to not work, and sound to be... off.

PRO's: Easy to set-up at best XMP settings. Overclock utilities work well. This board does have a second CPU power plug for extreme overclocking if that is one's desire. Heat spreader for the M2 SSD.

CON: If you aren't logged into an administrator account in windows, sound will have static and other issues.

photofrankFM^/msi-mpg-x570-gaming-edge-wifi-socket-am4-usb-c-gen2-amd-motherboard/6357223?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"This  review is for the MSI MPG X570 Gaming Edge WiFi AMD AM4 motherboard.
My review of this board is with the following attached components installed in a Mid Tower 17 X 17.5 X 7.5 inch case with the PS on the bottom. I mention this because with the large VRM heat sinks I had to move the AIO radiator installed in the top of the case, all the way to the edge to get it as far away from the board as possible just so the fans will clear the VRM heat sink and the top of the RAM heat spreaders. The top of the heat spreaders on my RAM sit 1 and 3/8 inches above the top of the RAM slot. So if your case is similar to my sized case and you use liquid cooling, it will be nip and tuck if you want to keep the fans inside the case.

See  pictures of the install. You will see that the upper VRM heatsink is under the AIO fans and the fan just clears the RAM . 

Power Supply-750 Watt
CPU----------AMD Ryzen 3700x
Cooling------240 mm AIO liquid
GPU----------RTX 2080 Super
RAM----------32 GB DDR4 3200 16-18-18-36
Windows 10 --1 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD
Storage------512 GB PCIe 3.0 NVMe M.2, 2 X 1 TB 2.5 in SSD, 3 X 2 TB 3.5 in HDD, one 4 TB HDD and 3 USB 3.0 HDDs

I had no luck with any kind of beneficial overclocking of the Ryzen 3700X or the RAM, which seems to be the normal experience with most who try. I choose not to loosen RAM timings to be able to overclock the RAM, I'm sure the RAM could have been pushed, but it did not make sense for me. By setting the strongest of the three prefigured overclock profiles in the BIOS I was able to increase consistent all core Boost performance to a constant 4.2 Ghz vs the + or - 4.0 it ran at default BIOS settings. I did get it to run at 4.3 under sustained boost for awhile, but it crashed immediately when I tried to go higher. I think that AMD has cranked about all you can get out of it so far as amateur overclockers like myself are concerned. I didn't really put a lot of effort into it as a couple of tenths was not going to make any difference that justified the occasional crash. I have tested it under stress for long periods using Furmarks CPU stress test, which taxes the system more than Prime 95 does. It does reach the advertised 4.4 ghz boost under varying load, but at full 100 percent on all cores it will settle in at about 4.24 ghz.

Lets go to the chipset and M.2 cooling fan. No worries. I have mine set to run at 1300 RPM all the time. That way the chipset will not get hot and it is quiet at that speed. Under the most stringent use transferring files, HWMonitor shows the System temp at 36degrees C , the chipset at 48 degrees, MOS at 40 degrees, PCIe at 33 degrees and the 4.0 M.2 at 32 degrees. I have three fans pushing air into the case and three exhausting air. So I think with the good airflow I have, it is staying at a safe temperature.

The board was easy to setup. After enabling A XMP in the BIOS it set my DDR4 3200 RAM at the proper speed and timings. I loved the fan control in the BIOS. You can set fan speed curves, full speed, do anything you want to either fan individually or all the fans together. You can choose the component board sensor for each fan that it is tied to. I found it much better than the iCue fan software that came with my AIO liquid cooler. It has a CPU, Pump and four system fan PWM connectors. What it does lack is enough USB 2.0 on board headers. I need two for my case and one for the AIO liquid heat sink, so I had to get a USB 2.0 splitter, which I have shown in one of the pictures. The board has both a USB 3.0 and 3.2 connector for external case connections.

I am using 2 16 GB sticks of RAM. so I can't comment on if it plays well with all the slots filled.  It has the RGB headers for those of you who have lit cases and components. I didn't mess with them as my PC sits in a ventilated enclosure in my desk so no body sees it. The board is a good looking board. The built in I/O cover fit properly. 

So far for my use, which is media editing heavy I am really happy. It may not be the best overclocking board, or maybe my 65 watt 3700X just doesn't have a lot of overhead to overclock. I bought it mainly because I need the fast file transfer speed that PCIe 4.0 provides. Need to note that only the one M.2 slot is 4.0 the other is 3.0. I bought a 1 TB 4.0 M.2 for the system and partitioned 250 GB for the system and use the rest as a working drive to load from and save to with Photoshop. I am getting 5500 MB/sec read speeds vs 3300 MB/sec read speeds with my Samsung PCIe 3.0 970 M.2. The system is unbelievably faster than I expected. PCIe 4.0 is going to be a major player in the next jump in PC performance. I suggest that you take advantage of this fast PCIe Bus and put a PCIe 4.0 SSD on it. Also when GPus start oversaturating the 3.0 PCIe bus capability, you will be able to benefit from those fast GPUs.

There have been some complaints about the WiFi, but I updated the BIOS before I installed Windows and it has worked just fine. Even from my garage where my workbench is. Also it isn't the quickest to post, but that could be because of it having to enumerate all the drives that I have attached.

So I think this is a good 200 dollar board for those who need WiFi and Bluetooth and buy the CPU and DDR4 speed RAM that they need and just let the board make it all work together with no fuss or worry about overclocking."^5^Jan 25, 2020 12:05 PM

The price was fantastic for what you are paying for. It has many benefits for a first timer such as the pre-installed IO shield also has bios flash update so you can update in the future. Many fan header ports but wish that they were spread out across the board. Also, in order to get all the ram you paid for you need to go into the BIOS to set it to the desired speed. Finally the instruction manual for a first time builder didn't match the board and let me confused. For example the ram slots do not have two clips that pinch down only one side comes down.

The IO on the back is also great with nothing that you would need missing and its nice to have a pre-installed IO shield to protect me from myself.

First thing i did in the bios was turn off the RGB... great, now i go to restart for changes to take effect.

And thats when this board fell flat on its face.

The board tries to restart. But sits there with only the cpu diagnostic LED on. 
ok... whats goin on here?
Discovered the board wont reset the bios with the bios jumper, or pulling the battery and leaving it sit all night. All traditional methods to reset the bios fail.
Ok... try a bios update with a usb jump drive.
Again, after many attempts(instructions are useless), got the board to appear to update its bios with a usb jump drive.
No effect, board still refuses to post.
Notice that i had the 8 pin cpu power connected but not also with the 4 pin(for a 8+4 power setup, assumed would only need the 8).
So went and fabricated a temporary 4 pin molex to 4 pin power cable because one didnt come with the motherboard when it should because up till recently these cables havent been used much since the pentium 4 days.
Anyways, plugged in the 4 pin and now instead of cpu, now my gpu is not making it on boot...
ok... switched the gpu to the second pcie slot(x8) and boom, we are posting to bios and i go about installing windows... so you have to have that 4 pin power connected because msi runs that power to the pci chipset and cpu somewhere and the board is completely unstable without it.

next thing i find, the documentation says nothing about sata raid other than the name and in the bios its nothing more than a on/off switch.... and when it is on, it detects only 2 of 6 sata drives and windows setup agrees that the other 4 drives are missing...

It was at this point that i threw in the towel after 2 days of trial and error with this motherboard and promptly exchanged for the Asus TUF motherboard which ran immediately with no hiccups other than a driver load issue with windows setup to recognize the Raid... and for ten dollars less mind you.

Avoid this board like the plague. It really does appear to be a beta test board that was thrown into production and has a power design that had a few bad design decisions, the documentation is horrible, the bios is horrible, its like broken chinese english translation..."^1^Oct 20, 2019 6:30 PM

Avoid this if you are planning to buy this motherboard for any 105-watt AMD CPU (3800x/3900x/3950x).  The power supply design cannot supply the current required for these CPUs.  The voltage regulators will overheat, hitting 100-120 degrees C.  When this happens, the board will throttle the CPU speed down until the VRs cool down.  When the VR temps rise again, the process will repeat itself.

MSi really screwed up the board design on ALL of the MPG lineup of X570 motherboards.  All of them have terrible VR designs causing the  to overheat.  I have one and it really sucks.  Better boards will only hit temps of 60-70 degrees.

If you can, go with the Gigabyte or Asus version.  A little more expensive but they had better reviews in the described problem above.  If you cant, put more fans in.

 With Ryzen depending on the speed of DRAM to increase performance, I wanted to get the fastest RAM as possible (and compatible). Several kits from G.Skill, PNY, Corsair, and Geil have all failed to pass the bare DDR4 spec of 2133MHz. Even my previous kit of PNY Anarchy X 3200MHz could just manage 2400MHz at very loose timings ( 20-22-22-40). I have had enough time to tinker with this new kit, and I am very impressed. So impressed that I plan on buying another 16GB kit to round out the RGB lighting. The rated speed is decent at 3000MHz which worked out of the box with no issue. However, these sticks were pushed to 3466MHz at tight timings of 17-18-18-35 and still survive a full 24 hours of AIDA64 at full burn. Just from 2933 to 3466, my cpu gained 14% improvement across the board.

TLDR: As of time of writing, the price of DRAM is only decreasing and finding a similar price/performance kit still costs $50+ over this kit. Temps are fantastic, and they're a beast in performance. Oh yeah, the RGB is the only downside; the LEDs shine through the opaque cover."^5^Jan 16, 2019 2:47 PM

Let me say, I bought this kit on a whim while picking up another item, because I got them cheaper than listed price at the time.
With that being said, I DID NOT check to see if this specific kit was listed on my motherboards QVL for compatability. After installing the kit, and going into BIOS/UEFI, I enabled XMP, and nothing more. Saved settings, exit...and NOTHING. I reset the board a few times to see if it would train. And loop after loop, always back to POSTFAIL- safety mode. After alot of reading, even more trial & error attemps at changing settings I was able to get into windows, more attempts, and eventually running stable.
This was the first time I've had a RAM kit NOT work on XMP right away. HUGE PAIN, let me tell you, as I've overclocked & delid cpu's, and oc GPU many times, but never had to mess with ram before. Ive read countless guides and articles about ram overclocking, timings, etc since, and im actually testing oc stability on another set of RAM i just recently picked up that is samsung b die IC kit because of all ive learned since.
TL;DR; If you dont have the time or want to go down the rabbit hole that is RAM timings, and settings, CHECK YOUR MOBOS QVL before buying to make sure its listed so no headaches! If you're like me, and love every aspect of overclocking, get a kit that has Samsung b die IC's, and read, read, read, and practice!

Overclocked to 3300mhz and havn't tried more or less. I don't think I can benefit anymore from it. Even the 3ghz seemed like I wouldn't be able to utilize it but cpu intensive games love these sticks.

I comes with all the hardware to use on either Intel or AMD boards. Great for all who are looking for the lighting and who have normal cooling needs.
 
Only three pump speeds in the iCue control panel, Silent, Balanced and Extreme. I saw no difference between Balanced-2300 RPM and Extreme-2800 RPM. I think the heatsink and radiator dictate the cooling capacity and running the pump faster doesn't make any difference. You will need an open USB 2.0 headed on your board if you want to use the Corsair iCue fan and Pump control software. I didn't so, I had to use a USB splitter. I will include a picture.

I tried it with the already applied thermal paste and with a premium thermal paste. I saw no difference in CPU temperature,
and many review sites have had the same experience, so I would just use the applied thermal paste.

The reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because the holes where the fans attach and you screw it to the top of the case aren't threaded. It is a real effort to screw in the included threaded screws and the heads of the screws will strip out if you don't have a good screwdriver head. Seems if you provided threaded screws ,the holes that they go into should be threaded also.

I dropped my CPU temps by 10 degrees below the temps that I was getting with the AMD Wraith Prism cooler that came with my Ryzen 3700X which I run at stock settings and my chipset, MOS and M.2 temps run cooler seeing as all the heat is being exhausted from the case rather than into the case as it is with the Wraith Cooler.

So I think that this is a sufficient cooler for 65 watt CPUs or maybe even 105 watt CPUs that aren't overclocked, but if you are running CPUs that can be radically overclocked, you may want to look to an AIO with better cooling properties."^4^Jan 25, 2020 1:24 PM

Exceptionally quiet and effective in keeping a 9900KS chilled. I'm pretty pleased with it. 

Assembly was a pain, however. Literally. 
The pre-tapped mounting holes (fan side and case mount side) were unacceptable. They were either tapped incorrectly at factory or screws provided were not the right diameter. 

I basically had to retap holes by forcing provided screws through holes. It was during this process that my screwdriver slipped and almost went through my other hand. Luckily it missed my hand and went straight through the aluminum fins instead. I did not have such a problem when I installed the previous, older unit years ago.  

Luckily, it was only a small section of fin surface area that was damaged and not one of the flow channels. I contemplated returning unit due to this damage but the unit works fine. 

Be sure to thread screws in and out of mounting holes before unit is in your case. Screw insertion will create small aluminum shavings. You don't want those around your components."^3^Nov 29, 2019 3:11 PM

I opted to add the second fan, it includes the optional second fan mounting brackets in the box.

I'm using it to cool an AMD Ryzen 5 1600.

It comes with a push button controller you plugin for the fan LED's and the LED's for the fan are multiple colors and have multiple modes.

There wasn't instructions on the lighting control module settings in the box.

Right now fan speed running at 30%, 1 fan on 10% and all others on 50% the temp is 26C/78F, 29C to 33C sometimes 36C is more common, it rarely ever goes higher than 41C and up to 107F or 111F under heaviest loads.

Before with stock fan it was running hotter and the higher temps lasted much longer, it took a longtime to bring the temps down before.

The only downside is you need to think about cable management a bit with this cooler especially if you add a second fan.

I highly recommend this version of the CPU cooler, the version before this one doesn't seem as good, the mounting area coverage and mounting configuration of that version compared to this one isn't as good.

We opted for the 6 series since our living room has skylights and very large windows. The 96 point contrast sensitivity is worth the higher price since colors remain vibrant no matter what the ambient light condition. The Roku interface is, as advertised, easy as pie to navigate. If you are also cable connected (Xfinity, etc), you are able to power on to cable channel without switching remotes (hallelujah). The option is nested a bit but easily done in network settings. 
Very minor quibbles:
only one USB port. Not a game changer and its possible, some say, to use a hub if needed. 
 Roku doesnt have available browser (at least not for free). If you are desperate to surf the web, you can do it on your phone and mirror the screen to the TV easily. Typing on-screen is lame anyway, so no loss here. 
If you are more than 8 feet from the TV and dont have 20/20 vision, 55 (or more) is the way to go. Easily readable. 
Settings for personal preferences are easily accessible and if you have OCD, you can tweak even more settings. 
Picture quality and color are well described in other reviews. Sound is more than adequate for basic use. 
Id also recommend Roku phone app since the BestBuy models dont sell with microphone enabled (advanced) version of remote. Just use the phone app and you can voice command. I plan to enable Alexa control at some point as well.

First build resides in a 400R case (golden year Sandybridge 2700k days, 5.3ghz USING the Original Corsair H100 240AIO.) TX750M PSU, replaced by AX1200 (SLI 1080TI's could bake a cake, midsummer, without AC). Corsair Fans a plenty. 2700k i7 hit 5.3 all cores w/HT utilizing a z68 Asus board, thermals kept in check all the while.

Zoom forward, H115i Platinum RGB Pro 280, strapped another pair of ML140 Pro fans for push pull. Here comes the Commander Pro. Defeats a perfect BIOS curve and cannot, will not, ascertain speed of, the presence of, or permit any semblance of *command* authority over any of my iCue detected devices. 8700k is happy on Z390 Meg ACE MB. The MSI board possesses multiple proprietary headers to enable JCorsair synchronous light and real-time command. Sure, uninstall the thing, rather, detach and discard, rewire 4 exhaust, 2 bottom intake fans and H115i with ML140's x4. 

32GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB (2x16GB) decides to wake up, latency drop from 18 to 15, happy with the timings.

Children, grab a solid fan controller - by virtue of a case manufacturer of well repute, or actively price out and research the controller of your dreams. I went Silverstone. Will go Noctua fans, or Venturi if the reviews be true.

Only reason this item did not receive 1 star, or the cliche 'woulda rated this thing a 0 star...' Is due to by some divine will of province, the fans purpotedly spinning in excess of 25,000 RPM, (that is when a reading of a sort - yes drivers updated, yes dragon enter defeat, reenabled, uninstalled, bios reflash, 7 live USB, the read write on my nvme reigning in the Commander's seemingly absent will to perform, shoot, not worth the RMA.

I then did some research and decided I will be playing at 144hz 1080P until I purchase a 2k monitor. Boy, was this card a huge upgrade from the 1060. This GPU just absolutely destroys any game in 1080P at max settings. I usually play Modern Warfare, Star Wars Jedi the Fallen Order or World of Warcraft and it absolutely crushes all of these games. It runs Modern Warfare (RTX ON) and WoW at over 140 FPS and gives me about 120 on Star Wars on Max Settings with 144hz. The build quality was amazing and the GPU worked as soon as I plugged in to the MOBO. Absolutely loving it.

I wish I could do some sort of comparison because from what I have read everywhere, it is better than this 2060 super I bought. However, some of the reviews I read said that the AMD card ran hot and consumed more power. Also that the fans couldnt keep up with the heat. Some reviews for the AMD Radeon said they had driver issues. For that reason I chose to go with the 'inferior' yet stable Nvidia RTX 2060 Super. The installation was super easy and I loaded a game on full settings and no problems at all. Might buy another to set up SLI down the road. For the record, I would have gone with the AMD had it not been so 'new to market'. With AMDs reputation I am certain they will deploy an update that will maoe it work even better and flawlessly. Unfortunately I am not the one that has the patience to research for solutions if I run into an issue. Just didn't want to take the risk. I had to settle for Nvidia"^5^Nov 21, 2019 11:29 AM

I've had a GTX 950 graphics card for the longest time and upgrading to the RTX 2060 Super is like a night and day difference.

I tested this card with various games in my library like Tomb Raider (2013), Wolfenstein, Resident Evil 2 Remake, Street Fighter V, Tekken 7, Soul Calibur V (I'm mainly a fighting game person), Mortal Kombat, Skyrim, The Outer Worlds. 

I only have a 1080p 60 hz monitor and 4K 60 hz monitor so I can't speak for ultra high refresh rates. But it blows any game in 1080p on max settings out of the park, no problem. I tested a variety of games in 4K as well. It will get 60 FPS 4K in racing games, fighting games, esports, MOBAS, less demanding titles, and games that are a bit older (2015 and prior is my definition of 'older').  In newer titles you'll have to tweak the settings a bit, some run fairly well in 4K and some do not, very dependent on the game. 

This card is really meant for high refresh 1440p game play (did a lot of research on it prior to and it seems to get well above 60FPS 1440p in the vast majority of games)  and I plan to get one of those monitors eventually to maximize the potential of the card.

The only game I play is BeamNG and of course this card runs that game effortlessly. So if you are looking for a gaming review, my review will not help you. However, I am a content creator and if you are looking for a review from the aspect of a content creator, then continue reading.

I am a 3D artist. I primarily use Blender. This card works perfectly for Cycles, Eevee and LuxRender rendering engines. I primarily use it for Eevee and Cycles and I have been doing some benchmarks. One RTX 2060 Super is quicker in some renders than two GTX 1060s. On average one RTX 2060 Super is about 90% as fast as two GTX 1060s. So yeah, almost twice as fast at cycles cuda rendering. However, if you are using Blender, there is an OptiX cycles rendering option that allows you to take advantage of the RTX cores. With this option turned on, ONE RTX 2060 Super is nearly twice as fast as TWO GTX 1060s.

If you are familiar with cycles rendering, you will understand the significance of that.

Let me put it to you this way with the following Benchmark results using the Blender BMW benchmark.

Two GTX 1060s overclocked takes 1:09 to complete.
ONE RTX 2060 Super takes 0:33 to complete.

Of course your results will vary based on other system specs."^5^Dec 28, 2019 3:46 PM

optimummind^/corsair-hydro-series-120mm-liquid-cooling-system-black/5845215?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^16^0^"Buying the Corsair Hydro H60 AIO watercooler kit for my HP Omen gaming desktop was a fantastic choice~! The stock Intel fan just wasn't powerful enough to keep the CPU temperature low during long gaming sessions playing Resident Evil 2 Remake, Metro Exodus, and Far Cry 5 New Dawn.

With the OEM CPU heatsink and fan, my Core i7 8700 reached temperatures as high as 97 C~! And at that temperature level, the stock fan was spinning so fast, it was very loud and distracting that I had to wear headphones.

After installing the Hydro H60 and playing the same games at the same room temperature, my CPU temperature dropped down to 74 C max (when playing Far Cry 5 New Dawn). On certain games, such as Resident Evil 2 Remake, the CPU never became hotter than 66 C. Depending on the game, my max CPU temperature varied. When playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider, for instance, my max CPU temperature was 70 C. 

My idle temperatures experienced great benefits as well. It went from 48 C on the stock HSF down to 29 C on the Hydro H60.

Besides HUGE temperature improvements, I also experienced great acoustic improvements. Although the Hydro H60 radiator fan isn't super quiet at max speed, it was still much quieter than the stock HSF. I made the Hydro H60 even quieter by replacing the stock 120mm Corsair fan with the 120mm Noctua NF-P12 fan. As a result, my system became even quieter and the cooling performance improved by about 2 C. Not a huge difference but still appreciated. 

All in all, this is a great product with excellent cooling performance and easy installation. 
_____
*Pros:

-Way better than stock Intel heatsink and fan (HSF). 97 C --> 74 C (when playing Far Cry 5 New Dawn).
-Way better idle temperatures - 48 C to 29 C.
-Easy to install.
-Stock 120mm radiator fan is almost as good as a more expensive Noctua NF-P12 fan.
-Very quiet operation (when not at full load).
-Good size for small & compact PC cases where a HUGE aircooler just won't fit.
-Good value.
-Easy to replace stock 120mm fan with a different one.
-Great warranty period (5- years).

Cody^/corsair-hydro-series-120mm-liquid-cooling-system-black/5845215?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^0^"The Corsair H60, a 120mm all-in-one cooler, is a good product so long as you realize what it is.

A 120mm cooler will not tend to run your CPU any cooler than a mid-range aftermarket aircooler. It is only a couple degrees cooler than the included cooler, in some cases (Looking at you, Wraith Spire, for being a good included cooling solution).

What a 120mm cooler will do is allow you to get the same cooling performance of a large aftermarket cooling tower in a much smaller package. While many cases, including small form factor mATX and mITX cases, support thin 240mm radiators, most people do not desire (or need) a $120+ cooling solution in those form factors. The H60 provides a middle ground between more expensive solutions, and cheaper but MUCH larger solutions, and it fulfills this role admirably. 

The pump is small, and the hoses do not interfere with RAM. The included brackets cover the gamut of modern (and two-ish generations back) mainstream processor sockets, so you are highly likely to be able to use it out of the box no matter if you are team blue or team red. The included AM3/+ bracket even works on AM4 sockets, thanks to AMD's choice to use the same hook-mount specifications as AM3. How much of a pain that particular mounting system is, that's something else.
The pre-applied thermal paste is quality, and saves some effort. Really, even if you purchase more expensive pastes to replace it with, you MIGHT shave a single degree off your temperatures.

The hoses on this particular model are a matte rubber. Nothing fancy, but robust and flexible.

The radiator itself is a thin radiator, which provides a large amount of clearance even when coupled with a standard fan, without needing to purchase a more expensive (and yet lower-performing) thin-line fan. The thinner radiator does not significantly impact its performance, as the actual overall size is much, much more important than thickness (120 vs 240 vs 280 etc)

Overall, I would recommend this cooler to someone who really only needs a $40ish aftermarket air solution, but either wants a clean look, or has no way to fit that absolutely HUGE heatsink."^4^Aug 3, 2017 2:02 PM

The computer has an AMD Ryzen 7 1700X processor mounted to an ASRock X370 Taichi motherboard.
I pre-planned the installation, but that changed once I put the motherboard into the case (Fractal Design Arc Midi 2). The case is fairly deep, and my plan to mount the radiator and fan to the front of the case had to be scuttled because the coolant tubes wouldn't reach the CPU.
I ended up mounting the radiator and fan to the top of the case, which has cooling vents.
The installation was very simple, and attaching it to the AM4 bracket required no modifications or extra parts. Everything needed is in the box. There is a video on Corsair's that helps explain the installation process.
The instruction booklet is very well written with good illustrations. Make sure that you read it.
I think the total installation time was about 15 minutes, and probably 10 minutes was deciding how to mount the radiator and fan and then forgetting that the fan needed to be ABOVE the radiator and not below it. My error.
Operationally, this runs very quietly. My CPU temps seem to hover in the 30-35C range.
The coolant tubes are very stiff. They aren't that much different from automotive coolant tubes.

The screws I used for a second push pull configuration had smaller threads than required. Now I have to spend more time and money finding compatible screws.

The instructions are simple, and if youre installing one of these hopefully you have some technical ability with logical skills.

The system was locking up in BIOS, so we removed 3 of the memory. The BIOS did not lock up. We then tested each of the chips in the correct #2 slot (the motherboard manual said to use for 1 memory chip). Sometimes it would lock up on boot and give us a black screen and sometimes it would make it into BIOS and then lock up. In BIOS, as long as we were suing the mouse or keyboard, it would not lock up. Only if we did nothing for 20 to 30 seconds it would lock up. We flashed the BIOS, reinstalled all 4 chips (64Gig total) and the operating system install went off flawlessly. The BIOS issue could have been from the CPU, Memory or Video Card. We let the computer run for three days, getting updates and installing other software. Never once has it locked up.

CORSAIR - Vengeance LPX 32GB (2PK 16GB) 2.4GHz PC4-19200 DDR4 DIMM is the product I am writing the review for. The computer hardware fully came from Best Buy during the 2019 Black Friday and Pre-Black Frida events. AMD Ryzen 3800X Processor, 64Gig ram DDR4 Memory, NVIDIA XLR8 1660 4K Overclocked Video Card, ASUS ROG Strix B450-F motherboard, Western Digital 500Gig M.2 SSD Drive, Corsair 220T RGB ATX  Mid-Tower. 

We believe the BIOS flash was needed mainly due to the CPU being a 3rd Gen Ryzen 7 CPU and the motherboard being a 1st & 2nd Gen Motherboard. We are doing game development, not competition gaming. It was more important to have 64Gig Ram for handling the 12 kilometers and 16 kilometers 3D maps. If we went with the faster memory, it would have put us over our budget. The difference between the 2400 and 3200 memory is only about 5 to 25 FPS in certain situations. 235 FPS vs 255 FPS is of no concern for us in game development. Some test showed 260 FPS to 265 FPS. The money was better put to the faster CPU and overclocked 4K video card for our purposes. Also, most of the FPS is due to the type video card in the system, but memory does have an impact."^5^Dec 6, 2019 5:47 PM

My computer world revolves around the idea that bigger is better. So, with that being said, i needed more Ram. This Corsair RAM WAS ON SALE so I bought 2 16 gig sticks. The way ram works is when you pull your programs off your hard drive, a portion of your software goes to RAM to be acted on by your CPU. So if you have more RAM MORE of your program is loaded into RAM, making your computer react faster because you dont half to load more program from RAM Because its already in RAM.

In comes the 2080 Ti. Granted, the price point is really unacceptable. So I wouldn't blame anyone who took a step back prior to even thinking about purchasing a 2080 Ti. Only get this card if 1) You don't mind spending a LOT of money 2) Your monitor setup could benefit from it (buying this for 1080p is definitely overkill and a waste) 3) You want to future proof your PC setup

Pros:
-Performance for 2K and 4K is amazing
-Probably the best powerful single GPU out there (aside from the X cards)
-If your case's airflow is decent, the air coolers for this GPU is actually quite decent. My GPU rarely goes past 70C and is generally hovers around 55C-60C (you'll need to adjust the fan curve)

Cons:
-That price, oh.... that price
-Card has a very thick radiator. Make sure your setup can fit this card inside
-If your case doesn't have a decent air flow setup, this card will truly heat up everything inside your case
-Precision X1 software has a learning curve

The only remaining question is, which over priced Ti do i buy?
With the way timelines keep slipping further away, I decided to go ahead and jump for the 2080 Ti XC Ultra as a point to upgrade to the forever back-ordered FTW3 Ultra model. So this is coming from the perspective that I get to use this GPU in the meantime. 

Pros:
Overclocks like MAD - This is installed inside of a Corsair 220T/RGB and it fits perfectly. The case handles both the GPU and a full ATX board, with the GPU correctly measured on Best buy Specs page. 

Using Precision X1 I have a rock solid core clock on boost of 2070mhz (stable), idling at around 39-40*C. The extremely thick heatsink/cooler combo put in tremendous work to achieve this w/ a 1000mhz clock to the ram. 

posts a 194% on Userbench 
just over 15,500 on 3D mark

paired with a Ryzen 2700X on air, ambient case temp under load is around 65C, with the core at approx 58-60C. This model is not ICX2, so you only get the node on the core itself. 

Temps translate into a effective use rate of 1980-2010mhz when gaming at 97-100% GPU usage. 

Cons:

1. Cost- It is a no brainer, I stepped up from a 2070 super, and wanted to cry when the total came out to over $1300 after tax. To put in perspective, my entire rig prior to that (monitor included) was only about that much. 

It is an absurd premium on this card, and honestly; if there were anything close to the performance level offered, I would have jumped. 

2. It spoils you- I was never a frame rate snob, happily gamed on console for two decades before finally being convinced, but ultimately was left wanting with a 2070S at 1440p. 
This card crushed 144fps in its sleep at 1440, and does a true 4k 60fps on nearly every game I have tried. 

3.Supply is incredibly limited- Even two plus years following launch of RTX- the ability to effectively bin these gpus, and their higher priced brethren, shows just how far they are stretching the current node process. 

Bottom Line-
Dont buy this card if you dont anticipate stepping up to a higher series this year, with the upcoming 3000 seires likely delayed until Q4 (i.e. early next year) This card will be the ultimate for a while, and the price definitely dictates it. 

Do buy this card if you are aware of that, and understand just how far ahead of other Cards this really is, the best Nvidia can hope to do is to match the output of this card for under $1000 come this time next year.

The only other thing I would do to get more power would be running two of them in SLI, but not alot of support for SLI configs.

If ray-tracing performance is important to you, although you certainly won't be doing max settings at 4K with ray-tracing enabled, it's really the only GPU available that makes graphically demanding titles like Metro: Exodus and Control playable with these features turned on. If you have the money and care little about overall bang for your buck, the 2080 Ti is sheer brute force that will deliver exactly what you want.

Other then that it is a good card!
Pros:
        -Great performance, kills it in the frame department in most games (For Honor 1080p Max Ultra- 180-220fps, The Witcher 3 1080p Max Ultra- 90-110fps)
        -Isn't too loud (is still a little)
        -It looks great in my build, it has a nice black finish and a 'XFX' white LED
        -Good temps (60-65 max edge temp but that's with max fans)
        -Best RX 5700 XT card you can buy from Best Buy (as of October 3rd 2019)
Cons:
        -The fans take about 5 min for the fans to spin down to normal RPM from a heavy load (its not because the barrings are good, if you turn off the pc they turn of immediately) 
        -In adrenaline the fans go to 100% at 50% on the graph for the most part (it has a mind of its own)
        -There are better cards in a similar price range (Though almost none have the convenience of a warranty from Best Buy)
        -MSI Afterburner combined with this card causes the screen to flicker black every 3-5 secconds
       
Verdict:
The XFX - AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT RAW II is a great card that you can buy. Should you? It depends if you want the warranty from Best Buy or not. If you do then go ahead buy this card, I get amazing frame rates and it doesn't get very hot at all! I would recommend to a friend.

So I gleefully purchased this card just a bit ago. I ended up bringing it back to Best Buy. I brought this card home, Installed it and fired it up. I noticed right away there was some kind of issue with the newest drivers. I was getting framerate stutters all over the place. I tried downgrading the drivers (after uninstalling with DDU) to a 'Known stable version'. This didn't help at all. I was still getting the stutters. I was starting to wonder if I had a defective card. So, I did some more snooping online and found hundreds of other people saying that this card had some issues due to drivers. I even found Reddit posts as of last month saying that even the newest drivers STILL had some issues. So, Much to my dismay, I took the card out, Put it back in the box, And took it back to Best Buy. I ended up getting the RTX2070 Super and now all of my games are buttery smooth on ultra settings.

Keep in mind this is no RTX 2080 or even GTX 1080 Ti. What it is, is an excellent 1080p or 1440p HDR video card. You do get what you pay for. If you want 4K, honestly going to say buy 2070 Super+. Will this card do 4K? Yes but you'll miss half of your graphics settings right now. 4K video? Not a problem there. This card barely reaches 60c 1440p in Borderlands 3 Maxed out in game settings.

Pros:

- Very good performance. Runs modern titles very well. I tested titles such as Monster Hunter: World, Dishonored 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 4, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Apex Legends. All of them ran at a reliable 60+ FPS at 1080p. All titles were on max settings, of course.

- Good value. For 400 dollars, you are getting a very solid card. This card competes with the 2060 Super, and has better performance. The 2070 Super is $100+ more for only a 10-15 FPS boost in most games plus the RTX feature. Not worth it imo, but if you want RTX and have some spare cash, go for it.

- Clean aesthetic. Not much else to say, except that it looks clean without any excessive RGB lights.

Cons:

- Sub-par drivers. The main thing Nvidia has over AMD is the driver support. Hopefully, in time, AMD drivers will deliver better optimization. 

- Size. This card is huge. Its easily the biggest card I've ever owned. It has only two fans, but the card itself is thick, ironically thicker than the 'THICC' branded XFX 5700 XT cards.

- Thermals. This may be due to not-so-great driver support from AMD, but for how big this card is, it runs a bit hot. Adjusting the fan settings in the AMD software is a must. After that, it runs acceptably, and the fans are not that loud at all. 

- No RTX. Obviously, the biggest difference between this card and its Nvidia competitors is the lack of RTX. If Ray Tracing isn't that big of a deal for you, then great. If it is, then buy a 2060 Super. It's the same price as a 5700 XT, but with a 10-15% performance cut and RTX.

The main thing holding this card back is AMD's subpar driver support causing problems (at time of reviewing) and its questionable thermals. This card blackscreened on me once, but after that, I've had no issues. Overall, a great card whose problems can hopefully be ironed out in time."^4^Oct 23, 2019 2:57 AM

I was recently gifted COD Modern Warfare 2019 & I was finally unable to play a game at my minimum standard of 60fps with all the bells and whistles.  So here I am floating between a 2070 Super and the RX 5700 XT as my next card and 1440p HDR as my next tier of graphical enjoyment.  After several reviews & some YT videos covering just about everything I needed to know about the current industry & what it came down to for me was a $100+ difference for less than ten percent margin on frame-rates plus Ray Tracing which to me seems to be a nice perk though limited in support right now = not cost effective IMO.

It's been a long time since I used a non-Nvidia based card actually since ATI had the All-in-Wonder card series and before AMD took over.  I've been eyeing putting together an AMD rig since the new Ryzen processors had been introduced & I figured now might be a decent time to do just that.

How I came about buying the XFX brand of RX 5700 XT card is by viewing their portfolio of hardware and reading the reviews offered.  I wanted to pick up their newest card which is the XFX RX 5700 XT Thicc III Ultra but my local Best Buy didn't carry it and I needed a card tonight so I can play my gifted game with friends and family so I picked up the XFX RX 5700 XT RAW II.  I am sure I will be happy with it even though deep down inside I know what I really wanted was the Thicc III Ultra...  oh well.  Hahaha!!

I originally held out thinking drivers were at fault, but the problems kept getting consistently worse and more aggravating. 

Drivers are up to date, in fact I tried various driver versions, some problems would disappear and a whole new batch of issues would re-arise in their place. I have spent more time fixing. troubleshooting and applying workarounds than having fun with this card.

Coming from AMD cards only, I adore AMD, this card is a beast when it works, but absolutely horrendous to deal with. Save yourself a headache and spend abit extra on the NVIDIA Super because those cards can run consistently."^1^Jan 28, 2020 3:26 AM

This card will max out everything you play at 1080p with over 100fps consistently. BFV runs around 130 FPS on ultra for myself at 1080p, and drops to around 110 FPS at 1440p. Division 2 around 120 FPS max settings 1080p. Doom on Vulkan maxes out at 200 FPS on max settings 1080p. If your case is properly ventilated, with room for the card to breathe it will not over heat and crash (like many others have stated). Not one over heat or crash yet. It can be mildly OCd and gains about 5-7% performance. The aesthetics of the card are solid.  Metal back plate, plastic shroud all black. The fans are a glossy black (but you never see the fans unless you have a vertical mount gpu).  White XFX led logo is subtle and not over powering.  This card is large taking up 2 1/2 to 3 slots on your board.  But so far no issues and Im really enjoying this card. Would highly recommend especially at the price point."^5^Jan 16, 2020 8:01 AM

Where to start.  I wanted to love AMD GPUs again after 5 years with a 1070 in an Alienware.  Unfortunately, the software and drivers for these cards is still horrible.  Its still as bad as it was back in the R9 390 days.  The card hard crashed my system about every 2 hours.  Also, it runs HOT, I dont care what you set the fans too, it runs 70-90C on most games.  Oh yeah, every time it crashed my computer it reset the fan curve to never go above 50% so it would just hit 100C if you didnt remember to change it every single time.  Sorry AMD and Best Buy, its coming back."^1^Jan 4, 2020 11:52 AM

So far my experience has been great. I uninstalled all of the Nvidia software/drivers before installing this card. The install went smooth. I made sure I downloaded the most recent drivers. I actually downloaded them from the XFX web site because they had the latest update. The AMD website didn't.

I am very happy with the performance of this card. I'm playing The Division 2 and I can tell a difference in visuals and performance. I'm not in the 4k realm, but the 1080P visuals are still stunning. On Ultra settings I'm averaging 100fps. Borderlands 3 also looks amazing.

Before installing Mac OS, I decided to try it out in Windows first.  

I ran DDU to remove older Nvidia and AMD drivers (while in safe mode) and after getting the card running, I was getting a display driver failed to start error...  I had to modify the registry to alter the delay timing for the driver and that error went away.  

Then I ran into another error where the shutting off the monitor made it so the card wouldn't reconnect when powering the monitor on (that's still very much an issue).  

Of course, my final issue was that the card would get over a 103 C at the GPU Junction while playing Overwatch...  I can only imagine how hot it would get playing something really taxing.  It actually idles at 62 C and that's double what my old GTX 1080 would idle at, but that card only had one fan!

Card had some mild coil whine but really wasnt too bad even with speakers on low volume. Did have some stuttering issues on first person shooter games even though FPS appeared high, and in one game would have occasional flashes where the colors would darken for a couple frames. However my biggest problem was reoccurring  issues with it freezing my computer or turning my screen black with audio playing in the background. Tried uninstalling drivers reinstalling, making sure card was seated correctly, etc but still had the same problems.

To be fair the  problem didnt happen all the time, and after a hard reset of the computer Id be able to boot up a game and play for a couple hours without problems. The freezes were random.

Upon installation (a clean install) the card immediately caused my PC to BSOD. I installed all the new drivers and went through the process - again, another BSOD. So I cleared the drivers and did a fresh reinstall once more - another BSOD, but now I could not even log in to my computer. The drivers literally corrupted my OS Win10 and I was unable to do anything.

As I am trying to get things up and running again, the card randomly started generating an insane amount of heat and the fans went into full 100% blow; mind you I was just booting the PC at this time, there was NOTHING under load because I could not even fully boot my PC.  So I remove the GPU and put my old GPU in instead and ran into the fact that it appears this XFX had burned out one of my PIC slots. That's right! It had done permanent damage to my motherboard, but thankfully I have another slot. I used the other PCI slot, used my old GPU (which is Nvidia by the way), and reinstalled Win10. This took me roughly 4 hours of time to just get my PC running again!

As mentioned, I was warned about AMD cards and told that the drivers are a mess. I even read various articles that the AMD cards have issues with M.2 and using a PCI 4.0 - which I have. I should have never made this purchase and XFX has not only robbed me of time, but their faulty product has caused damage to my motherboard, which is only a couple months old. I love my AMD 3700X processor, but they are simply not ready for the GPU market with such poor hardware AND software. 

Avoid this card at all costs, I do not care what the other reviews are stating, there is something seriously wrong with this card (do your research and you will find many articles and forums calling out exactly what happened to me) and I know that I will not be considered AMD for a GPU anytime soon."^1^Dec 8, 2019 2:13 PM

I returned it and paid the extra money for a 2080 card. Also XFX customer support was decent but it's a known problem about their fans not working properly either and the rep put it off on AMD even though it's clearly a bios setting that needs to be fixed through XFX. If you're going to buy a high end AMD card, probably better to go with msi or asus.

Any time I overclock this even if it's 1%, it WILL crash my system at some point.  Seems to have a lot of issues changing from one game to another or from gaming back to windows.  So leave the card alone!  Don't OC.  

***The best experience for me?  Leave the Radeon settings at standard for the least bugs and absolutely bump up the fan curve.  It's made a world of difference.  As has adding a small fan to focus on the junction point (ugly but effective).   Keeping it cooler will prove vital to your sanity.***

However, you cant really run it in 4k, but for the price of this GPU, you should know that. I currently tuned the fans because it does get really hot when you are playing a demanding game. For example, running Far Cry 5 (New Dawn) in ultra setting and 144hz monitor runs the GPU temperature to 80 degree (roughly) out the box when playing for more than 3hrs. However, you can lower the temperature by adjusting the fan speed. 

Also, the fans a extremely loud when it goes around 3000rpm but that is reasonable so its okay, just put on a headphone and you cant hear anything xD

Other things: if youre considering this GPU, I'm assuming you're spending a few bucks, so you should really look into the air circulation (cooling) and also the size of your motherboard and so on because I'm using a mini atx, and its freakin huge. 

Bottom Line: if you're looking into this GPU, you should really research if youre okay with how loud it gets and the temperature being pretty high compare to other high end GPU. But at the same time, this is really great price for what it can perform."^5^Dec 27, 2019 9:50 PM

Let's just say the raw power of this card is just insane. I was gaming at 4k medium setting and was hitting FPS. That's the good part.

The bad part. This card runs hotter than the sun, and then some. Out of the box, the fan curse was non-exisitent. I used my own fan curve and quickly found out that I needed it to be far more aggressive. 

With more tweaks, the lowest fan speed was at 30% and that kept the card idling at around 50c. When you start loading this card up though it will hit 85/90/95c easily, and that's with the fan going full pelt at 100%. Loud is an understatement. It's the loudest card I have ever heard in my life. The junction was always sitting at around 100/105c too. Just insanely hot. It's not the noise, and the worry about it spontaneously combusting just isn't worth it.

Also, Radeons Adrenaline software is good, but there were so many errors. Game after game crashed on me. I am sure that with a little more time the navi chips will be great, but seriously poor optimization means you should just walk right past this card. I picked up the EVGA 2070 Super and games that were hitting 90c on the XFX were barely hitting 62c on the NVIDIA Card.

However once I started up more demanding games such as borderlands 3 and monster hunter world the card would provide good frame rates at around 60 fps for the first 30 minutes. After that my screen turned black, but I could still hear the in game sound. I tried everything during my troubleshooting. After 2 days the problem still persisted and I decided to exchange the card for a 2070 super which has no problems at all. Stay away from this card!!!"^2^Jan 2, 2020 1:06 PM

I was playing Forza 4 Horizon at a steady 60FPS on my LG SK9000 at 4k and the card barely hit 90% duty cycle. If you want to push max settings at 1440P for most titles out there, this is definitely the card you want. Make sure you get the AMD Adrenaline software which allows you to under/over volt the GPU/VRAM and adjust the fan curves it comes with (The unit likes to run toasty).

Always hearing about how loud these are. Quite frankly, this card is rather quiet. 

At full load, this thing runs pretty cool at 65c.

Upgraded from a Zotac 1070 mini and I'm seeing a night and day difference.

Can finally run Ark @1440p on high to ultra settings around 60 frames.

Runs Modern Warfare @1440p on max settings (minus the irritating ambient occlusion crap) at 75 frames( my 32 inch 75hz HP Omen limits this thing).

Borderlands 3 doesn't drop below 75 frames on ultra @1440p

Red Dead Redemption 2 is running at medium to high at a steady 60 to 70 frames @1440p.

I've gained at least 30% in frame rate all the while beefing up the graphical details by at least a tier or two.

And for what? Under $400?

A steal of deal.

The only issue I've had is the Radeon software. Boy out boy is it far less fluent than nvidias. I already ran into an issue with running dual monitors at separate resolutions.  It does not like having a DP adapter to an HDMI at all. 

Other than that, extremely happy with this card.

I was putting together a new hand build PC, was replacing my A.i.O. water cooling unit and needed some additional fans for case cooling. These worked and are working well.  I don't want or need any LED lighting - just something that moves air. These fans are quiet and have been working since I installed them and turned everything back on. 

Just be mindful of how long you might need the power cable to be AND if you have enough outlets for your needs. In my example, I ended up having to buy 12' power cord extensions as the power leads on the fans weren't long enough, but had plenty of fan connections on the motherboard. The length of the power leads was not an issue of the fan though; that was my fault for not being through during my layout planning. 

I also bought some rubber mounting 'pins' (from another big name online vendor), so as to help minimize vibration -  it REALLY helped! A suggestion perhaps to Best Buy: offer these on the shelf too?

Construction is sturdy and very professional, like every other Corsair case Ive ever used or seen. Filters are fine enough to catch the majority of particles and very easy to remove and clean. Building in it was for the most part extremely easy as even though it is compact, it was well thought out as to placement of most access holes for Routing cables etc. the only complaints I have are that the mounting standoffs are about 1/2 too high to comfortably mount some larger fans or a radiator easily, and that the included fans are not PWM so they run faster than they really need to, creating noise that certainly isnt necessary. I swapped the fans out for some Corsair LL series fans I already had which made it virtually silent. I do feel the price is a bit high however it is significantly cheaper than other cases that I would classify to be the same size and quality, so thats ok. I just think all these smaller cases are overpriced, its not a knock on this particular case. Less material should mean less cost, but that has not been the case for smaller cases I have noticed.

I hardly ever use the read/write internal disc drive anymore so not having a place for that in the case was not a problem. I really like this case. I think it's perfect for a simple build. It fits my full ATX motherboard with a Master Cooler CPU cooler just fine. My power supply sits under the cover at the bottom and makes it look clean concealing the cords with it as well. It only comes with 3 fans so I mounted one at the front for intake and my HDD, one on the CPU radiator and one on the back. Doesn't come with software but finding it online was easy. The RGB fans are easy enough to install and move around. The software allows you to make them bright or dim and any color you want. I've had it for about a month now and the only minor draw back I would say is the filter. The filter stops most dust but not all but hey my last case didn't have one so this is a huge upgrade. I also like how easy it is to remove and clean them. The only other possible downfall I could see with this case is the front panel. The panel is metal with four nubs that each snap into a plastic part. I could see them wearing out from cleaning the front filter often but only after a long time of doing so."^4^Dec 20, 2019 8:13 PM

Cable management can be a issue if you don't plan the build wisely. I used a full size power supply with braided cable extension so I had some extra cable needing to be tucked away. Removing the HDD cage was a must as I don't use HDD's anyways. With the cage removed it does leave a opening to see some of the clutter, but it doesn't block the lower fans airflow.

iCUE software didn't recognize the controller so I though it was defective. Maybe I did the software install wrong, but removing the usb cable and putting it back on in windows cured the issue.

Bossman^/corsair-icue-220t-rgb-airflow-atx-mid-tower-smart-case-black/6370550?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The first thing to say about this case is the fans are LOUD. Super disappointed in the SP120 RGB fans. While they look great, they are DC only fans and have a minimum speed for 1200 rpm, so they are LOUD. They only go from LOUD to SUPER LOUD and with motherboard fan controls these days wanting to always crank the fans when the CPU temp is high, which happens as soon as you put load on them, this case will be very loud. 

I replaced all my fans with LL120 PWM fans which you can spin down to 300 rpm or so, but that kinda defeats the purpose of this case and the cost is now way higher than the iCUE 465X case. So in reality you are probably better off getting that case over this one as it comes with the LL120 fans already installed, unless you are fine with a super noisy case. And while you are at it get a Commander Pro to control the fans so you can avoid the nasty noise spikes when you open up Chrome!

The second thing to say about this case is that while the marketing material for this case say it can take up a 280mm cooler up front, that's not entirely correct. The cut outs for the fans in the front are for 120mm fans, so while the mounting holes would allow for 140mm fans, as you can see from the included photo they don't really fit. It would also make the RGB aesthetics of the case really bad. Unlike the iCUE 465X case, at least they are hidden by the front panel somewhat so it would not too bad, but it would not be ideal. Also the fan blades would be hidden behind the cut outs. 

I am not sure why Corsair just made the rails without the cut outs to make it better for fitting both 120mm and 140mm fans.

Also for those interested, it does fit a 240mm cooler up front just fine even though it does not say that. That's how I set it up in my case with a 240mm cooler covering the top two fans and the last fan just blowing on the hard drive case.

Finally I was worried about room for a GPU with a cooler up front, but it actually fits fine as you can see with my 2080Ti from my gaming rig mocked up in one of the photos."^3^Jan 3, 2020 4:03 PM

My motherboard was extremely cramped in this, it had maybe a couple millimeters of space at the bottom portion of the case. 

Cable management and wiring in general is an absolute nightmare, again there's just not enough space. Don't plan on using any sort of HDD in your build because you'll most likely have to remove the hard drive cage to get all of your wires coming from your PSU to fit. 

Neither of my SSD's fit into the included mounts either so that was another flaw, they are standard SanDisk SSD's. 

This was the single worst experience with a case in all of the PC builds I have done over the years. I spent nearly 3 hours trying to get this thing to work but couldn't make it happen. 

The only reason im giving this two stars is because of how great it looks."^2^Mar 25, 2020 12:47 AM

The middle fan of push/ pull set up had to be removed so my Evga black 2080 can fit in, the case could be a little longer. but no back exhaust fan? for the price there should be, another thing the combo audio port on top of case the headset / microphone combo where is the adapter to use a regular headset and mic? So I have to now buy a 3.5mm splitter to use top mounted audio port, the nzxt h510 comes with said adapter for their combo port, at a much cheaper price tag. Not happy with corsair..

I also wanted to mention this line from the product description: 'It produces 450W for better game and program performance' I personally do not believe having more wattage is going to increase performance at all.

The installation was ridiculously easy. All I had to do was plug it into a USB port and it was ready to go about ten seconds later. I didnt even have to open my computer or fuss with software.
 The Juke delivers sound superior to the so-so onboard sound I had before. Games sound so much better. In Quake, explosions are BOOM! Instead of boom and death screams are AGHHHH! Instead of ahhh. Subtle sounds like footsteps, grass rustling, and a breeze blowing in Skyrim are more refined, too.
When listening to music all the instruments come across clearly like the band is in the room with you playing.
Installing the optional software from the companys website is supposed to somehow make your headphones sound like a 7.1 experience, but I havent figured that out yet. Anyway, the amazing 2.0 sound is enough for me.
The juke obviously wont sound as good as some 100+ dollar product, but it should be enough for most people who want to play games, listen to music, and whatnot at home on their computers. And for only $15 its hard to argue with the price."^5^Jul 22, 2018 6:55 PM

The Juke usb sound card eliminated most of the issue. there was still some noise but it was much more tolerable. I later ordered an isolation filter for $11 of of amazon which got rid of the problem. $16 after shipping.

the filter on amazon is called 'Mpow Ground Loop Noise Isolator'

I have not tried it with just the filter yet and have not tried the mic input on the Juke usb sound card.

over all I am satisfied with the sound card. it is much cheaper than buying a sound card that is not available with out ordering it from best buy.

the only con is that when the computer boots, the speakers would pop loudly which I feel could damage your speakers if they are expensive ones. There were several pops as the computer was booting. I would unplug the usb Juke until the computer had fully booted.

using the filter from amazon there is only one small pop when the computer boots and no other pops. 

using both the usb Juke and the filter got rid of the noise issue for under $30.
I may buy an internal sound card later."^4^Jan 19, 2019 10:21 AM

Next step is the DSP mode which enables the surround sound and then select 7.1 virtual speaker shift and Xear Surround Max. Select Headphone and begin playing games. I tested the surround in Black Ops 4, Overwatch, Apex Legeands and Battlefield V. The Roccat provides a very solid surround that reveals people coming from behind or above. The Roccats surround can be clicked off so you can use the Dolby Atmos or Windows Sonic in Windows. I use Dolby Atmos and it elevated the effectiveness of the sound and positions of sounds very well.

Used different versions of Chromium on two different OSes: the faster system had the older Ryzen 1200 CPU running Windows 10, the slower 3200G system was running Chromium on Linux Mint 19.2.  Both systems were running 16GB RAM.  I know this is apples to oranges, but I had expected more from the Linux build with the newer CPU.  You will have to do a BIOS upgrade on some motherboards (such as the B450) to use 3000-series Ryzens.  I will add a GPU to the 3200G build.. I suspect that will bring performance up.

Hardware:
Ryzen 5 1600 (1st gen) @ 3.2ghz (overclocks COMFORTABLE to 3.9ghz)
16GB of 3200mhz DDR4 Ram
and of course, this GTX 1660 Ti graphics card.

So far I have tested a few games, and I'll show you the details/results below:

Forza Horizon 4 - Ultra Settings (all)
Averaging 120fps - plays fantastic.  It would dip down to 89FPS in certain situations where it is very nature heavy, but not for very long, and it still looked fantastic.

Gears of War 4 - Max Settings
Averaging 115fps.  The lowest I saw was 99fps during my benchmarks and playing the game.  Looks fantastic and plays great!

The Surge - Ultra Settings
Again, averaging 110-120fps.  It looks great!

Keep in mind, this is all being done with a 1st Gen Ryzen 5 1600 processor.  The GPU takes a brunt of the work upfront, and it does it with ease.  The highest I've seen it pushed so far is at 80% VRAM useage, during some parts in The Surge, other than that it's at around 50% VRAM usage for Forza and Gears.

Also, the RGB controls are wonderful, and it looks very slick inside the PC.  Picture attached."^5^Jul 7, 2019 12:54 AM

The way Im using it is they mining. Currently this card gets 30MH/S on Ethash *Undervolted* under 75 watts. which is a mining ago utilize in cyrptocurreny. Yes I know gamers dont like us but we contribute a great amount in nvidia sales as well and thats one reason Im writing this review. 
Out of the box it shows the workmans craft they put into the gaming edition great design and a touch of RGB. 
I chose this card because of the looks mainly and the efficiency of the card. Also for resale value in the future. If your a miner you should already know this is one of the best efficient mining card and if your a casual gamer wanting decent FPS than this is a great choice of well. This card also requires an 8pin pci connector so make sure you have one available on your PSU

I really didnt expect to be able to max out Red Dead 2!? averaging around 60 FPS which looks smooth as can be. Less demanding games perform even better.

This has half the number of processing/cuda cores, and the memory bandwidth is quite a reduction from the 5700XT that was my last purchase (btw the 5700 performs on par with a RTX 2070 non super) But despite those shortcomings, this card really pulls through and Im glad I got the 8 gig version.

SuperT^/corsair-lighting-node-pro-black/5845213?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^3^0^"I was doing a new computer build and purchased the Corsair Lighting Node Pro and combined it with the Corsair HD120 3 Fan Lighting Kit.
It is very simple to install. It requires a SATA power connector for power and an open USB 2.0 header from the motherboard to be able to control all lighting effects with the Corsair Link Software. The small contoller hub is easily mounted out of sight using the supplied two-way tape. It includes 4 lighting node strips and extension cables if needed. The lighting strips easily attach to you PC with 2 options. Each lighting node has a magnetic strip attach to the back. That was the method I used. But for someone that doesn't have a magnetic case you can also remove the tape backing and stick them down where needed.
Can combine this kit with more lighting node pro strips or with the HD120 lighting kit like I did. They work perfectly together. All you need to do is hook the supplied controller cable from the Lighting Node Pro hub to the HD120 lighting hub, that's it.
After installation you will need to install the latest Corsair Link software from their website. You then a can use the Link software to control all lighting effects on each node and fan individually. There seems to be an endless array of colors and lighting effects to please anyone. 
I would highly recommend this kit for its ease of use, quality and endless lighting effect options."^5^Jul 21, 2017 3:22 AM

You can have the unicorn vomit look if you prefer with rainbow colors flashing around or you can go with an elegant understated look- whichever fits you better. Installation is really simple as these are magnetic, and you just plug the strips (with optional extenders) into the hub, and then that plugs into your usb header on the motherboard. Corsair Link software could be better, but it's never a question of whether you can do something, rather a question of how long it will take to configure the lights the way you want them. The good news is there's tons of profiles so you can save your favorite modes for later. Also if you install them and freak out because you can't get them to work right away, don't worry- just download the software and then hit the plus button under the lights category to add the four strips so the software knows what you have installed.

Before installing this, my temps barely ever got as low as 38 C on idle and would reach 65-70 C while gaming. After the install, it idles around 29-30 C and playing the same games it's only hitting 40 C!  I have six 120mm intake fans with a very conservative fan curve, and I set the ml140s about the same.  Now the only noise I really hear is is coming from the GPU. 
The reason for 4 stars is due to 
A) the power and rbg cables coming off the pump are an eyesore.  They need to be sleeved like the coolant lines.  Plus they are very long and make cable management a pain, especially if you have other RBG fans set up.
B) Best Buy doesn't offer any kind of extended replacement plan for this product so if ANY part fails (fans, pump, coolant fittings leak) you have to contact the manufacturer.

I have a intel 9700k over clocked to 5ghz. On gaming it never exceeds 68 celcius. Very happy with this product just wish they made them for my 2080 ti.

NickYu^/amd-ryzen-7-3800x-octa-core-3-9-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356636?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"Basically I'm very happy with 3800x. I bought it on Black Friday with a nice price which is only 10 bucks higher than 3700x. But be advised, it is very very hot with a 105w tdp whereas 3700x is only 65w. And the performance I would say they are basically the same. The only difference is 3800x has a higher base clock but you can easily raise your 3700x in bios. Unless you are an extreme OCer, the boost clock speed will also be very close. At least my 3800x never hit the advertised boost clock due to my cooler and case can not quite handle so much heat. 
Besides, 3800x and 3700x are both single chipdate design, not like 3900x which is double chipdates. For Ryzen 3000 series,  single chipdate has only 1/2 ram writing bandwidth than double chipdates cpu. So in my opinion, unless you can find a nice price, go for 3700x or spend 100 bucks more get a 3900x"^4^Jan 4, 2020 6:24 PM

HabaBone^/amd-ryzen-7-3800x-octa-core-3-9-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356636?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^2^0^"Pros: Faster than my Intel 5930K and AMD 2600X in single and multiple core performance. The 3800X can achieve better clocks than the 3700X. I get 4.525 GHZ turbo boost using the latest bios on two cores, and about 4.350 GHZ max on the rest of the cores. Overclocking I can run at 4.4 GHZ all cores with 1.37vs, 4.425 GHZ at 1.4Vs if you're comfortable with the heat this processor can produce. I settled on 4.375 GHZ across all cores at 1.35vs. This allows the processors to stay under 73c full load. 

Cons: Off sale this processor is $70 more than the 3700X. This results in 1-5 FPS in additional performance which is great, but 150 FPS compared to 145 FPS is not is meaninglessness at 1080P. 
Lastly is the heat when using 1.37v or higher. I was regularly seeing temps at 80c when using 1.4vs. The minor bump in performance is not worth causing additional stress on your processor. When using turbo boost the 3800X is all over the place causing fans ramp up and CPU heat all over the place."^5^Dec 10, 2019 1:03 PM

Im a light gammer (World of Warcraft).  The processor comes with the AMD Wraith RGB cooler (which is gorgeous all lit up in my system).

During extended game play on The Ryzens CPU default settings, the processors temp. stays around 54 Celsius.  When I change the over-clock setting To precision over-clocking through the AMD Ryzen master software, that temp jumps up to around 63 C.  The fan bumps up a bit; audible but it is not full throttled at all...maybe goes between 1500 - 2000 RPMs.  Its still quiet though.

My game play doesnt change though, so I keep the settings on default.

It will run three or four applications in another window while I play my game and it keeps its cool on default...again, it will go into the low 60s Celsius, but the fans stay low and dont rev at all...silent, and no over heating...not even breaking a sweat!

I love this processor!  I would absolutely recommend it for its performance and stability.  It has not yet stalled or frozen even running gaming with 3 other programs like disk defrag., Samsung magician drive analysis, windows explorer (YouTube music video) and a game playing on another 32 inch high resolution screen (I have two screens on my rig).

Yes there are better graphics cards out there, but for this particular computer with a stock Dell slim 240 Watt power supply in it, this is a great choice. It runs cool and stable without needing a power supply upgrade or any additional power connection to the power supply. 

Perfomance change on the game Subnautica as example. It was running at 5FPS with a Radeon HD3000 series card all settings on low and resolution at 720P. It now runs Subnautica at 30FPS with all settings on high and resolution set at 1080P.

Just for reference the games I run are World of Tanks, World of Warships, Falcon BMS, and Flight Sim X. It can run World of Tanks on ultra settings but I would not recommend it as it does drop your frame rates, I have tweaked the setting between ultra and high in the game and and it appears to average around 80 FPS. I can actually get more if I lower the settings and turn a few things off. Highly recommend if you're on a budget, I love it."^5^Jul 20, 2018 1:07 AM

I recently purchased a Radeon 5700 Mech OC at Best Buy.  When I opened the package, I noticed that the sticker on the backplate read 'Radeon MECH 5700 OC BV'  <-- note the 'BV'.

Question #1: What does 'BV' in my product stand for?


I ran Display Driver Uninstaller 18.0.2.2 by Wagnardsoft ot uninstall previous video card drivers prior to installation of Radeon drivers on this card's product page at MSI.com.  I have beem advised that doing so will help prevent crashes and problems reported with other users of new video cards.  I have however experienced some problems, stuttering, and crashes with various games, all as a result of trying out various Radeon features such as Radeon Virtual Super Resolution, Radeon Anti-Lag, and Radeon Enhanced Sync.  I suppose it takes some experimentation to figure out which special Radeon features are compatible with which games.  I attribute these issues to drivers, not hardware.

The performance of my product seems on par with expected, with a 3dMark Time Spy score of 8054 and Uniengine Superposition score of 4420.  I have a Ryzen 3600 CPU and 16gb of 3200Mhz DDR4 memory, which also contribute to these scores.

However, it seems the memory on this video card runs quite hot. I was able to play DOOM 2016 at 4k virtual super resolution (a feature of Radeon cards) at a pretty solid 75 FPS. But in doing so, I noticed that my memory temperature hit 98 degrees Celsius.

Question #2: What is the maximum safe temperature for the GDDR6 memory modules on this card?  I don't want to degrade or break my memory.


I decided to see if I could do something to get my temperature down.  With MSI Afterburner and the Uniengine Heaven 4.0 Basic benchmark, I conducted a few experiments...

I have a Corsair Carbide 200r case, which has a single 120mm fan in the front and a single 120mm fan in the rear.  I locked both these case fans to run at 100%.  I then used MSI Afterburner to lock my GPU fans at various speeds and compared the respective temperatures with my case's removable side panel on or off.  Here are my results after running Uniengine Heaven 4.0 in 10-minute increments:

Side panel ON:
40% fan (1860 RPM):	GPU at 72, memory at 94
50% fan (2200 RPM):	GPU at 71, memory at 94
60% fan (2500 RPM):	GPU at 70, memory at 90
70% fan (2767 RPM):	GPU at 67, memory at 88
80% fan (2975 RPM):	GPU at 65, memory at 85
(above 80% is subjectively too loud for my ears, even with headphones)

Side panel OFF:
40% fan (1860 RPM):	GPU at 66, memory at 89
50% fan (2200 RPM):	GPU at 61, memory at 82
60% fan (2500 RPM):	GPU at 58, memory at 79
70% fan (2767 RPM):	GPU at 57, memory at 78
80% fan (2975 RPM):	GPU at 55, memory at 75

These results clearly indicate that my case is a heat trap. Simply removing the side panel usually reduced temeratures by about 10 degrees. But since I would prefer to not have to open up my case whenever I run a modern computer game, I tried installing a couple of 120mm fans into the side panel.  Running these accessory fans at 100%, I got the following results:

Side panel ON, side fans ON:
40% fan (1860 RPM):	GPU at 61, memory at 83
50% fan (2200 RPM):	GPU at 57, memory at 77
60% fan (2500 RPM):	GPU at 55, memory at 74
70% fan (2767 RPM):	GPU at 54, memory at 72
80% fan (2975 RPM):	GPU at 54, memory at 73

So my experiments clearly indicate that this GPU will likely want plenty of airflow to manage it's high memory temperature.  I reiterate that I don't know what constitues an unsafe temperature for GDDR6 memory; if it's safe up to like 110 degrees, then I suppose anyone could just buy this card and not worry about it.  However, I recommend downloading MSI Afterburner and set it to automatically start with Windows, which should automatically set up a fan profile that's more effective than the default Radeon profile.  However, I think the general rule of thumb is that all components should be well under 95 degrees.

I have attached images of the default Radeon fan curve (which probably doesn't run the fans fast enough for this card) versus the default MSI Afterburner fan curve (which probably runs the fans faster than necessary) versus my own custom fan curve.  Once again, I recommend downloading MSI Afterburner, setting it to start automatically with Windows, and either use the default Afterburner fan curve or set up your own as I have.

Overall, I would recommend this card with reservations, for reasons that should be apparent from this review.  If you have a case with powerful cooling, it's fine.  Otherwise, you should search for a card with a bigger heatsink and better memory cooling."^4^Feb 11, 2020 2:20 PM

- Exceptional VRM (cannot get it hot)
- Audio quality stands out
- WiFi speeds are best I ever saw
- Looks pretty cool, but I guess all motherboards do these days
- Plenty of fan headers
- Plenty of back panel connectivity
- Mechanically reinforced RAM and PCIe headers are a really good idea

Cons: - Really wish it had physical buttons like my previous MSI M7 Gaming used to have on the motherboard itself. It used to have a reset and power button implemented.

I used the first NVMe slot and it has benched out typical of the performance expected.  CPU is an Intel 9700K so it has plenty of overhead for gaming and other tasks.  I will look into over clocking someday and other reviews do say it's a reliable platform but I have not tried yet.  It is still early on but I have had no problems with this build and as I have said it a typical motherboard install.  Only issue, and I'm still researching, is the built in blue tooth.  Blue tooth is always odd when it comes to computers for me.  My headphones just keep dropping out and it takes a lengthy turning off and on and resetting computer then turning the system device on and off.  They are skull candy crusher wireless.  I also have the same issue with my LG bluetooth ear buds I use on my phone.

I also watched a youtube build by Jayz2Cents and that used a similar MSI board. I have to say for my first build, everything was very easy. I didn't have a disc drive for the drivers so I had to use a thumb drive to add the network drivers but once I did that I was able to finish the rest with downloaded drivers and utilities. I did end up having to update the bios (which took 15 minutes tops) so that my MSI Dragon Center would properly register the temp of my CPU. I've been running it for a week with no issues and it appears to be solid and I'm more than happy with it. I called MSI support for a quick question and they were good to deal with and picked right up.

The board utilizes a 4+2 voltage regulator design which is insufficient for the latest high (95+) wattage AMD Ryzen CPUs.  Better boards have as much asa a 14+2 VRM deisgn (such as MSi's top boards).  MSi cut corners here and it shows when the board is pushed under load.

When running under load, the voltage regulators will run a steady 95 degrees, extremely high where some other brands run only 65-75 degrees C.  If you are using a 65 watt or lower Ryzen CPU, this should not pose a problem.

If you are looking to use a AMD 3900X or any CPU that draws 95 watts or more, I would look elsewhere, especially if you want to overclock the CPU.  The motherboard will cause the CPU to thermal throttle, e.g. slow down until the temps go down."^2^Sep 26, 2019 3:56 PM

Here are my observations:

Pluses:
1) Mild overclock from stock speeds.
2) Quiet fan.
3) Plays everything I can find at ULTRA settings without a hiccup.
4) Temperatures are well within acceptable ranges (this may be due to the fact that I have a huge case with great airflow).

Minuses (These don't even count - they're minor nitpicks):
1) It's $229 more than the cheapest 2070 Super. 
2) No RGB lighting of any sort. This is not due to a problem with the card - that's how this card is. 
3) My eyes can make out any visible difference in frame rates from the 2070 Super - how high of frame rates do you really need? 

Ultimately I may end up with another 2070 or maybe even a 5700 XT - money really isn't the issue - it's the fact that above and beyond 60 FPS I can't tell the difference , but these newest enthusiast cards are so high that it's straight up silly to pay for something you can't tell the difference on!

The temps are hotter than expected sitting at maxes around 84 c while gaming in very well ventilated case (MSI's 200-300$ case) with stock clocks. There's no option for increasing power limit at all, potentially fixable with a vBios update however none have been released. For a 2080 super it is kind of disappointing, my MSI 2080 (non super) Gaming X Trio was quieter, cooler, and performed on average 5-10 fps higher. I'd only recommend this card if you absolutely want a 2080 super but don't want the FE version but want to get the lowest tiered 2080 super you can. For the nearly 800$ price tag after taxes this card doesn't perform as an 800$ card should (again this could potentially be fixed with a vBios update but at this point in time I'd say go with an FE, or go with a slightly cheaper 2080 (non-super) and overclock as you will get near to the same or better performance while also saving 100$+."^4^Oct 19, 2019 6:08 PM

Games look fantastic. Syncs up really well with Freesync monitors, and there is minimal screen tearing or input lag. Felt liberating to put everything on ultra ultra-high and still get 75fps.

Bad: The bad is very bad. Awkward and unusual driver-level errors (with the latest drivers from AMD). For example: an HDMI connection will randomly fail while playing Witcher 3, on a cutscene load. Or upon closing Overwatch, the exit screen will exit the game and then leave you with a black screen. On Windows, sometimes the Windows menu icon disappears. High temperature loads require manual setting of fan speeds to >50% in Radeon Wattmann to avoid unexpected downclocking and system shutdowns.

I should mention, my system has excellent cooling. I've got two 120mm case fans in the front blowing in cool air, a 140mm exhaust out the rear, and another 120mm fan exhaust out the top. My tower is a mid-tower, not some ITX cram space.

We built a system from Best Buy on Pre-Black Friday and Black Friday deals. Corsair Vengeance 2400 DDR memory (64Gig total), AMD Ryzen 3800X CPU, WD Black M.2 500Gig SSD, ASUS ROG Strix B450F motherboard, XLR8 overclocked NVIDIA GTX 1660 graphics card, Corsair 3 RGB fan case and a 750 Watt EVGA power supply. Windows 10 Home OS. We run virtual box with Ubuntu Server to develop MMORPG video games in Unity Game Engine.

Even with several internet browsers open, and running both OS and the Virtual Box with the Unity Game engine, we still average 80FPS in the 3D Game we are developing. We upgraded a couple older laptops we purchased at Best Buy years ago with new PNY 120 Gig SSD to use as Beta Server for testing. Lenovo Y-510 and HP Pavilion 17-e037cl laptops. The PNY SSD also come from Best Buy.

Some people reviewing appear to be unhappy with the slight difference in the memory type, but the differences are minimal. I mean on one card it would get between 79 FPS and 104 FPS and the other would be 78 FPS and 104 FPS. Sometimes on multiple tests, going through the same area of a game, the same exact card with the same memory would fluctuate and show that minimal difference. 

An engineer that knows card manufacturing and testing of memory types knows I am giving factual relevant data on this topic. Neither of the video cards utilize the full potential of the 3.0 PCI pipeline. Nit pickers complaining over 1 FPS and sometimes the slower memory might be faster by 1 FPS as the particles in the scene at that time might be slightly arraigned more efficiently by chance. It really is down to that factor. DDR 6 is newer than DDR 5 but some DDR5 performs about the same as some DDR6. Their holding mathematical figures and numbers for the GPU to process. It is millisecond differences that give a 1 FPS to 2 FPS difference sometimes. Most of the time they are the same resulting output. 

We even used DDR4  2400 memory because the same results with those tests. The 3200 showed a 2 - 4 FPS difference than the 2400 memory. We could buy 64 Gig of 2400 instead of the 32 Gig of 3200 memory. More Memory means more Multitasking at the same time and having larger 22K sized 3D maps in a game with tutorial videos playing on Asset reviews. FPS is more about the graphics Processor and Pipeline structure and the efficiency design of the game. GPU Instancing, Sector Streaming, Particle Emitter variations and Baked Mesh or Baked Lighting all play a larger roll in better FPS than DDR5 to DDR6 memory. The advert is a Typo, but the cards perform the same."^5^Dec 25, 2019 11:18 PM

I had read that the MSI Meg was recommended over the Maximus XI Hero as it had a better VRM, but I've always preferred the onboard sound of the Asus ROG lineup.  So this time, I went back to Asus.  

My first motherboard died after a week. I figured, okay, that happens. I exchanged the board for the same model.  Not too long after starting the system (not right away however), I started getting some sort of signal noise out of my speakers (which I ran with my previous build).  First I started looking for external influences, but no matter what I did, I was finding I could not get rid of the noise with the Asus board (unless I uninstalled the Realtek drivers or disable the onboard sound from the BIOS). I started reading on this issue and have found this problem looks to have existed for a couple generations now and it seems there are a lot of potential fixes. I've tried several with no luck.  Hours into this, I've still not figured out the problem.  I've also been unable to get Sonic Studio and Sonic Radar installed, which was a major factor in my buying decision. I'm going to keep working on the issues and will likely have to contact Asus.  If I get things resolved, I'll try and make it a point of coming back and updating the post. 

So far, I am quite unhappy with my purchase and have serious regrets of not going with the MSI Meg.  I have never had issues with my MSI boards. Sadly, this is the second Asus board I've had challenges with (I had a z87 Asus ROG Impact ITX board with a Haswell processor that gave me some issue a few years back. I did love that motherboard after working through the issues).   

If you a tossed up between this board and the MSI Meg, I'd have to say, listen to the reviewers.  So far, I regret that I did not listen to the reviews and going with the Meg as the preferred board.  

Best Buy Experience: 
When I returned the first board after it failed, Best Buy customer service was excellent. If you are in the Portland area, the support at the Cascade store is quite good and product selection there for PC's is quite excellent.  West side stores while great, just don't have the product selection of this store."^2^Oct 15, 2019 12:29 AM

The biggest gripe with this board is the top m.2 slot. IF YOU GET THIS BOARD - check these screws foremost!! The screws on the heatsink are incredibly difficult to unscrew. You have to be extremely careful to not strip the screws. They shouldve eased up on how hard they factory screwed them in. They shouldve also used flat heads or anything other than philips for these. I managed to unscrew them after a lot of effort and had to take out my graphics card just to gain more leverage and space to work... All for 2 tiny screws. Do better ASUS. The bottom m.2 slot was just fine tho, as both shouldve been from the start.

I also had some bent header pins out of the box, which was unfortunate - but I managed to tweeze them into place and they worked in the end.

I tested the card in 2 systems, both which are capable of handling significantly greater power loads.  The 1st uses an EVGA Supernova 1200w Platinum certified.  The 2nd has an 850w Corsair Gold certified supply.  I've been running dual 2080 Ti's in the 1st system and a 2060 Super in the 2nd.  Each 2080 Ti uses around 275-300w, and the 2060 Super uses around 200.  The issue isn't power, it's either AMD's drivers, or an engineering flaw in the 5700 series in general.

I returned the card after troubleshooting for around a week.  The image quality was superior to Nvidia, and the HDR performance in certain games like AC Odyssey was also superior, but the instability made it increasingly frustrating to use.

I do not recommend this product until AMD gets their act together."^2^Nov 8, 2019 3:33 PM

While playing Monster Hunter World, Soul Caliber 6, and Final Fantasy XV the game stuttered even on high settings that my old 4gb 470rx could handled with 60 Fame-rate. 

I tried the newest update that rolled out in Jan and recommended drivers from both msi and amd however the card still needs more software updates to be even effective at 1080p at 144hz.

Overall that persuaded me to decide to switch the MSI rx5700xt oc to EVGA rtx2060 xc super was the ray tracing feature. 

You are spending $400 dollars and the amd does not have ray tracing, I originally thought it was a software design however it seems it requires some hardware function as well, with AMD confirming graphic cards that will be developed later at the end of this year will have ray tracing with Navi 2 and Navi 3 gpu processors. 

In other words, the graphics card will be out dated with the price of a Geforce GTX that will outlast the RX5700 as it has ray tracing that will be furthered implemented in the upcoming games.

These HD120's increase swag by approximately 87%. I got two of these triple sets, so my computer's swag metric increased by approximately 174%, meaning it now picks up chicks better than I ever could.
That's right, with these fans my computer is the wing man you take to bars even though they end up leaving with the girl you had your eye on.

Regardless, I really love these fans. The control through Corsair Link, and using the Commander Pro, is great, offering tons of color options and several style options. You can set these up to respond to the temperature of any component you want that has temperature monitoring, which is awesome. The air flow is variable AF- I have the four on my cooler cranked a little higher during gaming streaming or editing, and the two on top of my computer running lower all the time as a gentle exhaust. They're pretty quiet if you set your fan curves well. If you crank them at 100%, they sound like a turbine. At my computer's hottest, I've only ever had these fans at about 60%, max.

These are premium, and the RGB effects are second to none. I highly recommend these things if you want a computer that's sexier than you."^5^Mar 4, 2020 12:42 PM

That is my answer to the question 'Is it worth it' but I bought one anyways. Why? Because I could actually use the performance in the games and resolution I play at (4K), I love new technology, and I can afford to buy the card without too much concern other than grief from the wife.

That said, who should seriously consider buying this card, worth it or not:

1) Anyone gaming at 4K and wants 60 FPS average or 3440x1440p and wants 100+ FPS on a G-Sync panel. This card is NOT going to wow you at lower resolutions like 1080p or 2560x1440p, but at 4K the difference is 40% over 1080Ti which is a pretty big boost and often enough to put you over that elusive 4K/60 barrier where the 1080Ti was close but not quite there.

2) Anyone who doesn't mind dropping $1K on a video card, previous Titan buyers, benchmark enthusiasts, that kind of thing.

3) Anyone who already owned a 1080Ti and understands there's nothing else faster for the foreseeable future.


So why isn't it worth it? Most people will correctly point out RTX 2000 series is the smallest performance jump and one of the biggest price increases from one generation of Nvidia cards to another.


That said, the price increase also contains a lot of forward looking and speculative features like Ray Tracing and Tensor cores for a new method of anti-aliasing that boasts of improved image quality at a fraction of the previous performance. If you buy this card, you are basically funding the R&D and adoption rate for these features as an investment for the future.


Not everyone is going to go for it, and that's certainly understandable, but that's why this card is so expensive. Its massive, its forward looking and its expensive to make. 

As for the performance, I ran a few benchmarks and they are in-line with published benches, Farcry5, FFXV, AC: Odyssey, all within 2-3 FPS of online benches. Overclocking is good, about the same as Pascal 2080Ti. The new FE cooler is outstanding in terms of build quality, but temps will touch into high 70s when overclocked so you need to turn the speed up. Overall its much quieter than the old blower fans but make sure you have good case airflow.

I took one star off which had nothing to do with the performance of the card which is definitely impressive. 1/2 star off for the price hike from Nvidia to $1200 for a non-Titan card. Another 1/2 star off for a poorly executed launch where this card was announced on 8/20 and supposed to ship on 9/20 but was delayed 2x. BestBuy was also late, but that wasn't their fault, it was an Nvidia supply issue and they still managed to only be 2 days late for me, which was great. Also, no RTX case badge from Nvidia this time, they've had this with their GTX founders cards since the 900 series.


Overall VERY pleased with this card despite the price, and not being worth it, but hey, I'm going to keep it anyways. I would not recommend it to a friend though, because what kind of friend would recommend a $1200 graphics card to their friend???"^5^Oct 15, 2018 8:39 PM

The price to performance ratio is absolutely abysmal. This is probably the worst series revision in NVIDIA's history due to how little of a gain it is on the previous series vs the cost increase.

That being said, this is the first gaming card that can truly say it can run games at 4k/60fps. Sure, you could get that on the 1080Ti or the regular 2080, but you had to compromise quite a bit in the settings depending on the game. With the 2080Ti, you can put the settings all the way up and get 4k at roughly 60fps. 

The two games I've tried so far (will update as I try more games):
Forza Horizon 4 never dips below 60fps with all settings maxed.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey averages 50-60 fps fully maxed with some dips into the 30s for a second when a lot of objects are being loaded. My assumption is this will improve to true 60fps with driver updates or even a game update since V-Sync is required in this game to eliminate screen tearing. It might even improve with a slight overclock, which I'll try in a few weeks.

Bottom line, unless you are trying to push 4k/60fps on ultra or are trying to push UWQHD at 120+fps, I would not recommend this card. The only reason I purchased this is because I've had a computer I built for the purpose of gaming on my 4k TV sitting waiting for this generation for the last half a year. I'm pleased with the performance so far, but the price is insane."^4^Oct 19, 2018 10:00 AM

1. I am in a unique situation when compared to most buyers. I only had to pay $216 in the end after using a gift card Best Buy gave me (long story). That was the only reason why I decided to buy the card. I would not pay the full $1,298.99 after tax out of pocket as it is too high of a price for 'unknown' peak performance. I say unknown because we do not yet know how Ray Tracing or DLSS will do in the future. 

2. This card performs very well for current games and is a huge upgrade from my GTX 1070 OC. It is absolutely PERFECT for current 4K 60fps gaming OR 1440p 144hz if you are trying to achieve 120+ fps at that resolution with settings maxed out. 

Bottom line: 

If you are willing to ride the promise that Nvidia has given us for Ray Tracing and DLSS AND you either make a stupid amount of money or you get into a unique situation like I was in, then this card will be for you. Especially if you are looking to run everything at max 4K 60fps."^4^Oct 18, 2018 9:33 AM

This card blows every other gaming specific card out of the water. After purchasing this card I ran it against it's non-Ti counter part, and the performance increase was unreal. At 1440p, max settings on the 2080 I was averaging 90 FPS on Black Ops 4 (while overclocked at 2.1 GHz). At the same settings with the Ti I averaged 158 FPS (without OC). So without even overclocking the Ti model that's  nearly a 60% performance increase! Overall, I cannot recommend this card enough.

Only the RTX Titan is above this card in performance (ok and Volta but that's not in the same ballpark). This is not the best bang for the buck videocard but you should know this already. You are buying this to game 4K or 1440p 144hz max settings. Ray tracing is not supported by many games right now so that is just the icing on the cake and it seems like the lower RTX cards will struggle a little. 

I upgraded from the 1080 Ti to this card and to be honest I couldn't tell much of a difference. Regardless, this is a beast card and the build quality is impeccable (other than the faulty RAM some units had).

Easy installation and boot up once in the game nividia experience auto set the graphic configurations. Ultra everything no problem at 1080 144hz runs most games at 170 plus to max game settings. But it auto scaled resolution to 200% on everything which without realizing it was dipping fps to 120 plus but big spike dips. Still super good for 2 k 144hz but 4k is still not up to par you'll still be getting roughly 60 to 75fps on ultra. Mine luckly stays cool and quite for a founders card. At 144hz ultra 270 fps highest it hits is 81 C or 177F with 4 stock case fans on there own learning curve (smart case h700i) 

Ok now the features ray tracing and dlss. Almost none existent. 
Battlefield just launched rtx that's it. And it's not super impressive. Youll roughly get 50 to 70 fps at 1440p at 1080 you'll roughly get 60 to 80fps.

Plus the power house pc you need to run it tho if your spending 1200 on a graphics card it better be up there anyways. 

Overall I enjoy it for 2k ultra no rtx. Rtx is at its early stages and without games to see the performance of it and dlss it's not worth the 1200 price tag. 

Also with the newer 7nm in the talks I have a feeling this will be around for a year or two before the next card comes out and assuming those rumors hold it will be better plus you have time to see implementation.

Is it worth the price? No.

As mentioned in other reviews, this card is for you ONLY if you MUST have the best performing card on the market AND paying way more for a little bit better makes sense to you. Any other combination of if's and the answer is no.

Pros:
 - While the RTX generation yielded several triple+ slot cards, even in the non-ti category, this 2080ti card takes only two slots. This card is also actually shorter than two of the three 1080s I own (one of them was a 'mini').
 - It is fairly quiet. It's only marginally louder than my previous 1080s (non-ti)
 - Fastest card there is.

Cons:
 - Price. An RTX 2080 or even a GTX 1080ti will give you a much better bang for your buck. You can get a 2080 for ~33% less and it'll likely only be about ~15% slower.

Let's get this out of the way: There is *nothing* wrong with the build quality of the GPU itself. It's a standard Nvidia Founder's Edition (FE) GPU, which is also available directly from their website. Historically, all FE GPUs are excellent in terms of performance and reliability. You really can't go wrong with any of them, whether you're getting a 2080, 1080, 1070, etc.

If you want the BEST of the BEST and have money to burn, this is the GPU for you. Period. It will run 4K gaming setups while it's cooking dinner for the kids AND taking the wife out shopping. Nvidia has taken their Turing GPU architecture and combined it with the updated GDDR6 VRAM to establish an incredibly quick and powerful video card, not to mention the addition of ray tracing units, which are dedicated to real-time ray tracing and performance enhancement. So, again! If you absolutely need the best video card on the market, this is going to be your solution.

Now, why did I give it only 3 stars? Simple:

***This GPU is not worth the money in any way, shape, or form for the current generation of video games available.***

Previously, Nvidia would release their flagship X80 Ti GPU (780 Ti, 980 Ti, 1080 Ti, etc.), with each generation being much more powerful than the previous, giving up to a 40% increase in performance between generations. The average cost of a flagship model upon release has been around $750-800USD, unless you purchased a more expensive model with additional bells and whistles, such as enclosed liquid cooling, overclocking, etc. The last iteration of this was the powerful 1080 Ti, which was approximately $700-750USD for a founder's edition version.

What performance difference is there between a 1080 Ti and a 2080 Ti in 99% of all real-world testing?

About 28%.

$1200USD versus $699USD - That's about a 60% cost hike to obtain that 28% performance gain. For most gamers it's simply not worth the cost.

The 1080 Ti will still play almost any triple-A title at 60FPS without a sweat, 4K included. Base 1080 GTX video cards are going on sale in many places for under $450USD, which is still a very powerful GPU capable of playing most games at ultra settings at the point in time, and is a much better deal for end user.

CONCLUSION:

If you need the best and have too much money in your wallet, this is your GPU. In all other cases, I recommend purchasing the previous generation, as the price versus performance increase is not reasonable at this point in time."^3^Oct 5, 2018 12:45 PM

As for paying a premium for the Founders Edition card that's supposed to have higher quality components...2080Ti cards, particularly the FE version, are a having a rather high failure rate. Note that Nvidia will then make you pay shipping for the card you will have to RMA.

I originally thought that the RTX 2080 non TI would be enough to get the max 60 FPS that is possible for the TV but it just didn't quite cut it. 
I guess you could say I got lucky because the 2080 that I purchased continuously overheated no matter how I configured the fans in the case. This made me look into exchanging it for a new one and the closest Best Buy to me had the RTX 2080 TI in stock and not the non TI version at the time. I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade it. Now I get mostly 60 FPS on Assassins Creed Odyssey at ultra settings. I haven't tried any other games yet. 
My biggest worry is that if the non TI version struggled without Ray Tracing then when it actually becomes available would it really be worth it if I had to adjust graphics settings or drop to 1440p or 1080p to use it. It could be that the Ray Tracing may drop the FPS on the TI as well but there is a better chance for it to stay closer to 60 FPS.
I don't regret buying the RTX 2080 TI, I only knock off a star due to the price. It is expensive but NVIDIA knows that they have the best card out right now and are taking full advantage of it."^4^Oct 15, 2018 12:34 PM

There has been no middle ground when your mouth sounds the words '2080 Ti'. It's either, 'Oh the new GPU?' Or the screeches of the money-less about how it's 'too much' for their wallets. It's not only the first iteration of a new GPU series with brand new gen of GDDR Mem and entirely new VRM layout; it's redesigned completely.

While it's not worth the price if you're going to play < 2K resolution it's a powerhouse at anything 4K Max related. It can eat HDR like it's nothing and push frame-rates I never thought possible at extreme settings.

Since my boyfriend has a 8700K machine with 2 1080Ti's I'll be putting this together into a different build with a 9900K once those are shipped at a normal price.

At just under 13 inches long, 5.5 inches deep, and 2.5 PCIe slots, It also requires 3 power connections 8/8/6, making it look almost like a 24pin motherboard cable. expect this to take up your case. It fits nicely in my Corsair 1000D.

Performance wise, this is a single card ready to handle 4K/60 with high/ultra settings, all on its own.

For reference to what I'm running this on...
Asus Rampage VI Extreme
i9 7900X (no overclocking)
64GB 3200MHz C16 DDR4 RAM
MSI RTX 2080 Ti Gaming X Trio (no additional overclocking)

- Final Fantasy XV ran at 4K/60fps with minimal drops on the highest settings with only AA, VXAO, and ShadowLibs disabled. Enabling VXAO and ShadowLibs took it down into the 45 to 55fps range with drops to 30fps in battles, which is still playable if you're not bothered by less than 60fps performance. Running the benchmark, I scored 6376, just over 5% higher than the standard RTX 2080 Ti listed.

- Shadow of the Tomb Raider on ultra settings with HDR and AA disabled ran an average of 61fps at 4K/HDR, with a low of 52fps and a high of 95fps.

- Because why not, I ran Sleeping Dogs (Definitive Edition) on ultra (extreme) settings. With AA on extreme, the game ran an average of 50fps, with a low of 30, and highs in the low 60s. Turning AA down to normal, the average went up to 87fps with a low of 59.

- And lastly, I threw a fan favorite at it... Batman: Arkham Knight. Can you taste the sarcasm? At 4K on ultra settings with only AA disabled, Arkham Knight ran a lovely average of 80fps with a high of 108. The lowest minimum I saw was 58fps despite the screenshot showing 33. This benchmark chokes at the very start coming out of the loading screen.

If you're using anything less than 4K/60, this card will handle whatever you throw at it. Tested several games on my Asus 34' ultrawide @ 3440x1440 with AA turned up, and it obliterated everything.

The card idled or of the box around 45C, so maybe you've heard complaints about heat. Fans don't spin up until these cards start to get hot, so I installed MSI Afterburner to setup a custom fan profile. Idles now around 30C. In my testing, I never saw temps go much higher than 65C.

According to MSI Afterburner, I was reaching a boost clock of 1995.

Note that the RTX GEFORCE on the side of the card doesn't have LED lighting and makes it look a bit broken with the rest of the RGB around it.

Waiting on a second one to enable NVLink, but after all the 4K testing, I'm thinking maybe I should cancel it or stick it in my X99 system that has 2 Asus 1080 cards.

The price is high, but the results speak for themselves.

I'm coming from 1080 SLI which handled my 3440x1440 gaming, sometimes with AA, sometimes without. The RTX 2080 Ti feels like a perfect single card solution for this resolution. 4k/60 will require some settings being turned off, like AA, but that's expected.

If you're looking for 3440x1440 or 4k gaming, this card is for you. If you're gaming on anything less, this will obliterate everything you throw at it with the highest frame rates."^5^Oct 25, 2018 12:48 AM

I was impressed by its design and looks as I Installed it into my new gaming pc. This time I around I told my self I deserved the best! When the card was working fine it was more than a match for my Acer X34, driving the monitor to heights my old 980 Ti only dreamed of. But then everything came crashing down not more than 2 days after install. After one reboot of the PC after a Battlefield 5 crash, nothing to do with the card, I see nothing but purple 'space Invader' like artifacts all over my screen. I am a pretty technical guy with decent googling skills but all attempts to fix the issue have ended in failure. I am not one to easily RMA a product but after a week of attempts I have finally given up. Just sucks having to go through the whole process. I would hold off on these cards till they become a bit more reliable. Now I am afraid I have backed a bad horse and even when I get my replacement all I can think about is when will it happen again. Not a fun feeling when you put a 1400 dollar car in a PC that will be my main gaming workhorse for beyond the 3 years of the factory warranty. I would give this card 5 stars for performance but my rating will have to be 1 start because I was always taught growing up, you are only as strong as your weakest link and in this case its reliability."^1^Jan 26, 2019 9:32 AM
Beradon^/msi-geforce-rtx-2080-ti-gaming-x-trio-11gb-gddr6-pci-express-3-0-graphics-card/6290652?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^0^"Recently I upgraded to the MSI Geforce RTX 2080 TI Gaming X Trio from my Geforce 1080 FE from a few years ago and I have to say this was well worth the upgrade.

I've been driving my 4k screen from my GTX 1080 for a few years and while it 'could' do it, it wasn't 'great' at it.  Most games at 4k would run well even at high settings, but I was missing the 'ultra' settings that I really wanted.  This card can do 4k at ultra (at least in all of the games I've tried so far).

Anyways, to start.  The packaging is relatively average, that is to say, it is well packaged, but there's nothing special about the packaging.  For such a high end card marketing to a premium audience it could have had a bit 'more' to the packaging to make it feel like a premium experience.  One thing they did that I really did not like is the fact there are 2 separate clear film plastic stickers stuck to and around the fans, that if you got overexcited in installing your new card you could miss, in which case you've effectively taped one of the fans stationary.  This is poor packaging.  Hearkens to the screen-protector-that-wasn't-a-screen-protector for the Galaxy Fold, but in this case you DO want to remove these to ensure your fans rotate freely.

The first thing you'll notice is the card is HUGE.  The specs mark it as 327mm which puts it just shy of 13 inches long.  This is long.  Very Long.  My GTX 1080 looked like a baby next to it.  This is important to note because I was installing this into my Antec Twelve Hundred full tower proved to be a challenge and I am actually having to upgrade my case to fit it fully, with the card in place and functioning, one of the drive bay racks in the tower will not slide fully into place.  So be aware, you need a case that can handle this card.

Second, when installing, you'll find that the card has 2x8 pin power connections and 1x6 pin power connection.  I've never installed a card that requires so much power, and on top of that I believe most of the 2080 TI cards only have 2x8 pin power connections, so this card has the capability to draw a SIGNIFICANT amount more power than most 2080 TIs.  This also means you need to be sure your power supply will support all of those connections.  It DOES come with one adapter to go from 6 pin to 8 pin if needed, but suffice to say you'll still need a total of 3 connections.  It also comes with a metal support bar.

In terms of performance, as I hinted earlier, this card screams.  In running Assassin's Creed Odyssey there are zero hiccups and it runs at a full 60 fps at all times in 4k on ultra settings.  Clearly in games like Overwatch it barely even breathes hard.

On the note of breathing, you will notice one important thing about this card.  The fans have a function where they TURN OFF when they are not needed.  So if you're just in Windows and not doing anything graphic intensive, do not be surprised to see the fans not turning.  This is a feature.

The card has multiple long bright RGB strips along the side and front which default to a cycling rainbow effect.  You can manage this from MSI's RGB Software (Mystic Light).

Overall the card is pretty incredible and near the top end of the market (aside from the obscenely expensive RTX Titan, not that this card isn't expensive enough).

If you're in the market for a top end card and have the budget (and space) to install it, it is well worthwhile.

Pros:
Fast, really fast - 4k 60fps fast
RGB lighting (if you're in to that sort of thing)
Lots of cooling

Cons:
Huge, massively huge, it will not even fit in some full tower cases
Needs TONS of power, 2x8 pin and 1x6pin is more than any other card in the class"^5^Jul 8, 2019 10:07 AM

Raw performance and overclocking potential is the real draw here, and this beast delivers on all fronts, however...

This is the largest card I've ever seen.  Once I pulled this thing out of the box, I was aghast at how truly massive it is, it DWARFS my FE 1080ti.  I've got a Corsair Crystal 680X case (the thing is as big as a refrigerator) but I only have less than an inch of space between the back of the card and the front case fans.  Definitely take realistic in-case measurements before going out and picking up one of these porkers.

This thing is also HEAVY.  My Z370-P motherboard did sag with the sheer mass of this card, the included bracket is necessary unless your motherboard is seriously reinforced at the slot.  The bracket is a bit unsightly unfortunately, might not blend well depending on your RGB/case color scheme, which is a shame as the card itself is very aesthetically pleasing.

One thing that does seem unusual is the lighting on the card.  The RGB is great, but while the MSI logo is lit up on the side of the card, the actual RTX Series logo is just a decal.

Overall, if you've got the money and the desire for top tier performance, this is one of fastest, coolest, and most attractive 2080ti's I've found.

Read a lot of reviews and decided to go with the corsair. The weight of the corsair fan was much heavier and also makes a better chasis fan. This fan can also be used for radiators or CPU heatsinks. The noise and performance was what made me purchase this fan as it can go from very quiet to a audible louder sound at full speeds. This fan moves a lot of air and the white LEDS are a nice white around 5000k in color. Almost 30 bucks for a fan but it feels and works great.

I have check the cabling and cannot find any disconnect between the fans and the motherboard.  The bottom two RGBs work great.

It's kindof ironic, I did not really want RGB lights, but bought the case at the last minute to assemble a PC before Christmas.  After 11 years between builds, there was a learning curve.  Asus VIBE controls the LEDS and the keyboard lights.  The case is solid and quality built.  I just can't give it five stars with an LED going out within a couple of weeks of purchasing the case.

If anyone from Corsair would like to comment, I'd sure like to know if this is a known issue and/or if there is a replacement fan I can order, because I'm not taking the whole machine apart to get the case repaired."^4^Feb 24, 2020 10:52 PM

My motherboard does not have such headers. Tried looking everywhere for some type of adapters to make things work but was totally unsuccessful. Corsair also sell RGB LED Fan hub, LED Node Core, and RGB Commander Pro. None of them worked either. They all require different type of 4-pin connectors.

I have a 2080 gaming x trio and there's less than a finger width between the front fans and the gpu. If you have a high end Mobo and a decent sized gpu good luck fitting any AIO. I have mine mounted at the top and you cannot access anything at the top of the motherboard without removing the entire water cooler and radiator. This case would be good for anyone with a small gpu and an air cooled cpu. If you want to build a decent water cooled system with a gpu that has enough fans to keep cool, I highly suggest a different chassis/case. Build quality is good however when the specs state it will fit an aio cooler it is recommended to actually fit them with the average components installed instead of saying it will fit them in only the perfect specific conditions."^2^Sep 29, 2019 3:27 PM

So after about ONE WHOLE minute of pain staking research I found this. It was basically this model or a 1GB version that my local best buy had in stock, I went with the 2GB version just cause the price difference seemed too low not to. Supposedly it supports 3 displays I have not tested that I just have it running to a 32' hdtv as of right now. All my content now loads with no studder and my APU usage is now down to 20-ish% ('ish' definition: generally around this number but does fluctuate, never going above 40% under a normal work load).

HP Pavilion a6838f desktop units with 8GB ram running Windows 10 Pro (8GB is maximum allowable on that motherboard); was expecting to free up Shared Memory, hoping to transfer video memory demand to 2GB on card, per other successful user reviews. 

Cards and software installed on both PCs by our tech. On one PC, it works okay, running 2 monitors (Word + Outlook) for increased worker productivity, only using 1.5GB of Shared Memory.
 
However, on second PC, it sucked up additional 3.9GB of 8GB shared system memory with same settings as first PC (total 5.9GB memory for video), slowing system response considerably while running QuickBooks, Word and Outlook, sometimes freezing completely. 

Found that system BIOS on both HP motherboards did NOT allow reconfiguration of Shared Memory (i.e. restricting new video card on second PC to just 0.5GB or less of Shared Memory). No work-around other than pulling video card and reinstalling OEM drivers for Intel onboard vid chips. Ah, NO!

So be sure FIRST that your BIOS on motherboard is indeed reconfigurable; read that motherboards from 2014 & newer should work without issue. 

Recently solved memory issue on second PC via ReadyBoost by getting a USB 3.0 card and adding 32GB USB 3.0 thumbdrive; fast system response now, system freezes solved, but takes as a few extra moments on PC shutdown for extra memory to finish writing to hard drive.

Yeah, I know, others seem to flock to Apple, but I really do prefer Windows. In any case, Windows 10 was not recognizing the stock NVIDIA card from 2009 in my system (it would misidentify the card during upgrades and would only allow basic HD driver, which prevented photo editing apps from working properly), so I needed a cheap upgrade to insert into a PCI slot. While I have had to sacrifice the USB 3 card I got, that is fine. This is because I was banking on removing the stock NVIDIA card. Well, it seems I cannot do this because it causes Windows to crash. I have not had the time to figure this out, I am just glad I can use my photo editing applications like Adobe and Luminar. I don't do games, so I have no clue how that works.

Graystone55^/lg-super-multi-24x-internal-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-black/2691169?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^23^2^"I have mixed feelings about this purchase.

1st, the drive received is not a GH24LS70 but rather a GH24NS90. I sure wish BB would stop switching products out without changing their ad descriptions!

The picture in the ad is not of either of these drives. It shows the Lightscribe logo and the LG and the SuperMulti logos. The actual drive has only the LG and SuperMulti logos as well as a M-Disc logo.
I bought this drive because the picture indicated it was Lightscribe certified. Neither the drive advertised nor the one provided support Lightscribe. Without the Lightscribe capability it is not worth $40 as many drives without this feature sell for $10-15 cheaper.

The software packaged with it is Cyberlinks Suite. Cyberlink stuff is pretty bad at interfering with other things in the PC and advertising you to death if you are not careful how you answer setup questions. I wish they would have provided the bundled versions of Roxio or Nero instead of Cyberlink. That might have made the extra cost for this drive a little more worth it.

With this drive is a single M-Disc and it is M-Disk certified. There's no included information on what this is. After several internet searches, it looks like it's just a more reliable type of DVD. But to use these you have to buy M-Discs which are about $3 each! Also you can't label these disks like you would a standard DVD. Ouch! Another nearly useless included feature that few people are likely to use.

The speed of the drive is good at both burning and reading DVDs. It has lots of formats of discs it supports writing/reading to. I hate the Cyberlink Software Suite and am back to using an older version of Roxio.

While I'm a bit disappointed I did not get a Lightscribe drive like all my other drives have been, it is useful as a simple no-frills rewriter. I ended up putting this newer drive into an older PC because my older drive did do Lightscribe.

In summation, if you are just looking to read or burn DVDs and CDs this drive will do it fine.

I don't know about the quality as I haven't had it but for a few days. But the last LG rewriter I had lasted me for 3 years and is still going strong. I burned about 2 discs a week with the last one. So hopefully this one will be as reliable too.

I chose to say yes to the recommend to friend box although I have my reservations due to the issues stated here. I was told by a BB in-store person after the install that if I installed the drive I had bought it. They won't take it back since it was installed and used once."^3^May 24, 2012 2:30 AM

I know it's advertised as a 24x drive, but it's not worth using it at that speed. Also, mechanism and plastics just seem a little cheap.

The tool from LG to upgrade the firmware also doesn't work for me, but the preinstalled firmware works perfectly, so not really too big of a deal. Overall a very good unit for the price, Windows 10 issues aside.

SOLUTION FOR WINDOWS 10 PROBLEM:
Windows 10 gave me a bit of trouble (and apparently a lot of others when googling for the solution), but just hit 'Windows + R' type in 'devmgmt.msc' and hit the enter key. Expand 'IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers' and right click every entry and select uninstall. After that, reboot Windows 10. *DO NOT REBOOT UNTIL EVERY ENTRY HAS BEEN DELETED!!!*

RedMage^/canakit-raspberry-pi-4-2gb-starter-kit-clear-case/6365734?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^0^"Getting a Raspberry pi 4 was tough for a while, but being able to get one at a local retailer is a huge boon. Simply because the price is no different from the prices on CanaKit's own website, and amazon.

The kit itself is nice, the case is a huge step up from their Case for the Pi3 model b/b+. It still has the notch to hold a camera board, both upright behind the usb/ethernet ports, and on the lid behind the raspberry logo, but gone is the plastic layer that covered most of the board making it possible to use a much larger variety of accessories within the case from different cooling solutions and HATs (hardware on top). Additionally there is now a clip in place on the lid to mount a cooling fan.

The kit comes with everything you need to get started, though only just. The pi itself, case, heat sinks, power supply, micro to full size HDMI cable, and a micro sd card with noobs software preinstalled so you can get Raspian OS up and running minutes after opening it up and assembling it all. You of course will still need your own screen, keyboard, and mouse.

A major recommendation though would be to get your hands on a fan for the case early on, the little heat sink does help with the temps a little but with a fan you can run it more reliably at the cost of a little power and noise. My tests on 2 separate boards get idle temps in the high 60's low 70's and quickly jump up to the 80's when actually doing anything without a fan, and idles at 38/40 degrees with fan and only ever climbs to around 55/60 in regular use. [synthetic benchmarks can push the little machine much harder and still reach temps in the 80s with a small fan and heat sinks, but that's not a true test of what to expect.

CanaKit does offer kits that come with a fan as well through their website though it would have been nice if they were the ones best buy were carrying. It's not a deal breaker though.

Some things to take note of:
1. The Raspberry Pi 4B can output on up to 2 4k screens from its dual micro hdmi ports, it can run one by itself at 60fps, or two of them at 30fps.
2. Despite being able to run 2 4k displays in use, it is not able to actually stream 4k content reliably. At least not as of my writing of this review. As software catches up to the new hardware it may be more capable down the line.
3. Micro HDMI ports are fragile, take care when plugging and unplugging your cable or your going to have a bad day.
4. The internet is your friend, use youtube, and google to the fullest extend of your abilities and you will almost always be able to find someone who is having or has had the same problems your having with it.

With all that in mind however, if your just starting out or even if you've used raspberry pis in the past, its a good kit to pick up since it has all the important components you need to get started on a new project, and you save a little money compared to picking up power supplies and cases and cables separately."^4^Oct 4, 2019 8:24 PM

K33gs^/canakit-raspberry-pi-4-2gb-starter-kit-clear-case/6365734?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"The Raspberry Pi is one of my favorite tech toys.  More than a toy, it's a great tool!  I have used one to start a photo booth business, I've used them to monitor networks remotely, digital signage, and the list goes on an on!  And, now we get more than 1GB of RAM, it's now something someone could use as a light workstation.

This it is a great way to get started with the Pi and I'm so glad I can pick one up at my local Best Buy!  The only downside to this kit is the case, it gets warm and gives a cheap plastic smell.  You could put a fan in there to help, but I prefer a better case.

I'd still recommend getting a kit, though.  The Pi 4 has been known to be picky about USB-C power supplies.  So, I'd recommend the kit without the case.

Versus Intel's i9 9900k, you won't see a difference in gaming unless you're counting a few frames difference that you'd never notice without the FPS counter.

I can have basically every piece of productivity software that I have running at once, with a browser open and 100+ tabs with a video playing and still play a AAA game with very little performance loss. So if you are just a gamer then this CPU is a bit excessive. A Ryzen 7 X3800 would probably be a better choice, but if you game and run heavy multithreaded workloads like 3d modeling / CAD, video editing, or rendering then this CPU is awesome. It can run games incredibly well while still crushing heavy multithreaded workloads.

With this CPU I can work on models with way more active points in Zbrush. My old CPU (Intel i5-4690K OCd to 4.4 Ghz) would start stuttering around 2-4 million active points, while this CPU can handle around 20 million. It is very nice to be able to work on a model at that detail level without having to use Zbrushs Geometry HD feature. 

Another big advantage of having this many cores is that even while a heavy multithreaded workload is running there is usually still enough CPU left for normal computer functionality. When I was stress testing this CPU I ran Prime95 then I forgot to stop it. I went on browsing online and watching a video without noticing that anything was wrong until I started to run another benchmark. I really noticed this when I rebuilt the lightmapping in Unity the other day and I could still use my computer normally, with my old CPU my PC would be barely function during this process. Admittedly most applications that are really multithreaded allow you to set how many threads you want them to use, but with this may cores you will probably never even have to think about it.

As many other people are reporting mine does not seem to turbo up to 4.6 GHz, the most that I have seen on my monitoring software Is around 4.54 GHz, but this CPU is so powerful that I do not really care. Plus I get a solid 4.15-4.2 Ghz clock on all core loads, which is really good considering the rated base clock is 3.8 Ghz. I get cinebench R20 scores that average around 7350, my old CPU just got 1580. Idle temps are around 40C and full load temps are about 70C in a good air cooled case. I am using an ASUS TUF 570 motherboard (which I highly recommend) and 32 GB of 3600 MHz ram."^5^Oct 6, 2019 7:07 AM

I can attest to the fact that the CPU is blazingly fast.  When using applications, the CPU kills Intel's i9 9900K.  But all is not perfect.

While rated for as much as 4.6 GHz, 90% of users have polled that the CPU never reaches that speed.  My sample maxes out at 4.45 GHz.  Also note that AMD rates the CPU speed only at one core, i.e. all the other cores may not reach advertised speeds.  So while my CPU peaked at 4.45 GHz, most of the cores only averaged 4.35 GHz.

Another issue is that the CPU runs hot, as much as 95-100 degrees, even a 280mm water cooler.  Previous CPUs would run as high as 80-85 degrees so the AMD is a lot hotter.  This is due to the smaller 7nm die and high clock speed.  It is constantly running at 1.485 volts, even at idle.  This high voltage is not conducive for long life. 

On the other hand, this CPU kills the Intels when running applications that are multi-core friendly since this CPU has 12 cores and Intel's i9 9900K only has eight.  I use the AMD for rendering videos, which usually takes about 45 minutes,  the same video will take about 60-75 minutes on the fastest Intel CPU, the i9 9900K.  The speed difference is a lot higher when compared to Intel's i7 9700K which has eight cores but no hyper-threading (the AMD has 24).

Playing games, the AMD is a tad slower than the Intel, because games run better at higher CPU speeds and are not core dependent, but the differences are usually about 3-7%, negligible when you are looking at 120-150 fps with a good GPU.

Be also aware that the X570 motherboards designs are all over the place.  You have to get a board that has a well designed voltage regulator layout.  Some boards have only a 4+2 design which means the VRMs hit 125 degrees.  The CPU will throttle back its speed until the VRMs cool down and repeats this cycle.  Better boards have as much as a 14+2 VRM design which keeps the VRM temps to about 60-70 degrees."^4^Sep 26, 2019 4:14 PM

Okay this going to get more technical as I go deeper but I'll try to put that lower down.

For gaming it's fine but if you're just streaming consider 3700x. It's an excellent alternative.

Boost clock issue: This CPU currently (9/6/19) does not hit its advertised boost (cooler master ml370r) some very expensive mother boards do get close or beyond sometimes. A high end Aorus or ROG is needed for that. (Update is said to be coming to fix this issue)

Overclocking Notes: After following every OC guide I could find I can say it is possible to beat Precision Boost Overdrive (By a good amount too!) 

Motherboard:
One of the main problems is that VRM Temps are too high with the boosting on this system. Aorus Pro, ROG Strix, or TUF seem to have the best VRM temps. Some people do undervolt to fix this.

*** 
If you have an x470 motherboard make sure to patch it first or contact AMD and they will actually send you a CPU to boot and update.
***

RAM:
The infinity fabric that connects the two dies is tied to the ram speed. So get quality RAM with good timings and clocks. (Just google a calculator so you don't get screwed with bad timings) after 3800 it does decouple from the infinity fabric.

Linux notes:
This one has been a struggle. I haven't tried it with every Linux distro but here are my experiences.

Debian:
Works like a charm so far but I haven't had it running very but it will at least run.

Arch:
No. Some of the bugs are patched but after two manual builds, manjaro, and anarchy none of them would fully boot. It would freeze during start up (9/1/19 release)

SyGreenblum^/amd-ryzen-9-3900x-12-core-3-8-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6356274?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^0^"I recently built a new PC coming from a Intel 3770K.  The 3770k is still a good processor and I still use the machine but as far as speed the Ryzen 9 is roughly twice as fast on average but this depends on the programs you're running.  The speed of the system in general feels much faster, much of this can be attributed to moving from and SSD to an M.2 drive but having 12 fast cores certainly plays its part.

One thing I should state is do not fall for the M.2 PCIe 4.0 marketing pitch.  They are currently twice the price per GB and under normal circumstances are 'slower' then Samsung Pro devices and most cases slower then even the Adata 8200.  Maximum transfer speed means almost nothing in typical use.

If you are mostly just gaming, get a 3700x and put the extra money into upgrading your other components. For 3D rendering, virtualization, or other heavy workloads, this is an amazing value. 

I live on an island with no retail electronic stores nearby, so I order just about everything online. Best Buy was one of the few vendors to restock the 3900x at MSRP, which was a big deciding point for me giving them my business. They also offered fast, free shipping.

Also want to give a shout out to Rigen from Best Buy customer care. I ordered right before they added the Outer Worlds/Borderlands 3 bundle. Called them up and asked if I could get a code and the support was great, everyone I talked to was very polite. Said I should get an email within 24-48 hours. Received it about an hour.

Going from 8 cores to 12 cores was a smart move and great for having lots of applications open.  With the 1700 playing or streaming video while playing a game would definitely kill fps.  With the 3900x, no noticeable performance decrease at all.  Upgraded to it mainly for gaming at 165hz at 1440p.  1700 on pubg and a 1080 ti was averaging low 100s.

The infinity fabric that connects the chiplets was not clocking properly to match memory clock speed to have a 1:1 ratio, causing bad latency at high Memory speeds.

3900x blows my 9900k out the water when it comes to work and gaming. 9900k has a slight edge in my gaming benchmarks but the work load performance in 3900x is unmatched at this price point. Got lucky with the binning of my 3900x as well as it clocks its Infinity fabric up to 1900mhz.

-Set RAM multiplier to 32x

Your motherboard needs to support XMP profiles for you to get all the speed out of this RAM. After you install it, you must enable the XMP profile in the motherboard setup or it will only work at 2600mhz, not 3200mhz. (Basically it is a way to overclock the RAM.) It is not hard to change, but you need to know if your motherboard supports it. (The manual will tell you.

Vamadman^/corsair-carbide-series-275r-atx-mid-tower-case-black/6237542?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"I bought this case for my very first build and I chose the right one. I added 2 more fans to it to help keep it cool.  I like the simplicity and no frills look of it along with the satisfaction in knowing I got the most bang for my buck.  I put an AMD 3700X CPU on an MSI X570 Edge WIFI mobo with 32gb 3200mhz RAM and a Cooler Master Hyper 212 CPU cooling fan and still have plenty of room to add more stuff.  The white LED's under the front cover add a touch of class to the case and was an added bonus.  Cabling was a breeze with all of the cutouts and oblong grommets to run wires and hide them neatly out of sight.  The front cover is solid brushed look ABS so if you are looking for a case to mount RGB fans into, this may not be the one for you as they will not be visible from the front of the case.  The tempered glass side panel with knurled thumbscrews and rubber grommets is easily taken off and installed if the case is laid on its side.  The glass cover adds a nice look too as you can see the inner workings of your build.  This case is not fancy like a lot of others but with its minimalist appearance, it has a classy look.  Remember, less is more."^5^Dec 23, 2019 4:46 PM

The first night we took it out of the box to check it out and thought it was very nice looking. The glass panel was confusing to figure out how to open so we undid the hex screws, then put them back realizing that was a mistake and the thing had a magnet to open. Well, those screws probably should of had a warning because the glass totally fell off and shattered 2 hours later. This case it probably great, but Im thinking that if those screws affected the glass panel that much that there should be a warning or something put in to make sure people dont mess with it.

This is something VERY important to know:
Corsair has two lines of laptop memory, parts that start with CMSA are optimized for Mac laptops and (CMSO 16GX3M2A1333C9) is designed for non-Mac laptops. Generally the speeds and capacities are mirrored so that they have the same speeds and capacities for both platforms.

I replaced the hard drive first (upgrade to High Sierra killed the HDD hard drive) and saw some improvement in reboot speed and performance but overall performance bumped up noticeably when these modules were installed.

However as others have said, I think airflow is not the greatest.  It'd be better to just simply take off the front panel, but if doing so you still have cords that connect to it to deal with.  If you do that, be careful because the snaps that hold it in may break.

Also the tempered glass is nice, but I already lost one of the things that separates the screw from directly touching the glass.  When taking off the glass, you almost have to put the PC down flat, because if you happen to lose grip, that glass could fall, and it only has like a small ledge there to rest on.

Fans cant be placed on the very top panel either for some reason.  Also no room for CDROM.

Overall, it's a nice case, but if I had a second choice I'd aim less style and more practical.  I don't really like using a USB CD drive...  This is my first time buying a case though and the bust buy guy said it was a good one.

For proper airflow you need to be able to pull air from the front and out the top and or back but it cant even do that.

Fits perfectly in my midsized tower. Measure to make sure it fits. Bad reviews based on not measuring don't give this justice. Dropped about 20 degrees while idle, while gaming it dropped 20-30 degrees depending on the game. Average temp idle is 37 in case, ambient. Gaming never goes above 53, average gaming is 47 and it's overclocked to 4ghz. (Might be different for your situation, it's also on the paste it came with). It's not loud IMO. I have 7 fans, and it's rarely loud. Rgb I could care less about but icue software works fine for adjusting color and performance. I'm sure there are cheaper products, but I was in a pinch and was local. I'd say worth a buy. Install was annoying but was easy and straightforward. Hope this helps."^5^Oct 21, 2018 3:45 AM

Ran some extensive Benchmarks to see how well it would handle. Kept my CPU between 35 to 42C with no issues. As of now I dont see an issue and I checked the cords an connections to make sure it didnt leak before I installed it. Pretty well built. Only time will tell how well it will hold.

Games I play include Lord of the Rings Online, Guild Wars 1/2, Diablo series, CS:GO, Borderlands 1/2.

Looking to make some cash I sold my GTX 1070 and put this Radeon RX560 into the rig. I see absolutely no difference in real-world gaming experience between the two cards at 2560x1600. I know on paper and by tech specs there is no comparison between these classes of cards (and that the GTX 1070 blows it away). But all of the above games assign highest/best quality settings to both cards when I auto-detect the graphics properties. Sure, FRAPS tells me a different story when I actually watch framerates. But as far as gaming experience goes I see absolutely no difference. Actually, I prefer the colors and saturation of the AMD Radeon RX560 over the GTX 1070.

Bottom line - in more demanding top tier games this card would most likely be trounced by other offerings. But if you are playing games similar to those listed above, even at 2K resolutions, the RX 560 will do perfectly well and provide you quite a satisying experience without stuttering or lag.

I hope this helps someone making a decision on their purchase."^5^Aug 14, 2018 5:00 PM

It ran fine in everything from an old Inspiron 530 to a new modern Ryzen system.

It's suprisingly cool and quiet, the fan rarely comes on.

AMD doesn't do a good job being clear on which card is which. This one's the 896 shader version. Read the fine print before you buy but the actual performance difference is only about 3%-10% real world.
Pro's - Very good FPS performance on 720p. Ok FPS performance on 1080p. (This is not for 4k games but does support 4k video). The card runs cool and quiet. DX12 and Vulcan support. It's a vast improvement on the Intel 530 integrated graphics it's meant to replace.
It's a few FPS slower than the 1024 shader version and the GTX 1050 2gb cards (varies from game to game) - but it's less expensive too. If you want 60 FPS+ 1080p gaming you should get an RX 570 or a GTX 1060 anyway. This one's attached to an older 720p TV and does very well in e-sports titles. Most AAA titles can be played at lower to mid settings. The most demanding titles will display but won't play well.
It need's a dedicated power connector because of t's power requirements so check your power supply to make sure it's big enough.
I needed a budget priced card to give a handed down gaming PC some punch for my son on his TV (I kept my GTX 1070 for me). This works great. If his TV (monitor) was 1080p I would have gotten a higher end card."^5^May 29, 2018 1:10 PM

Previous card was an NVidia GeForce 970 and this card outperforms it. For example, in an older game, Just Cause 3, the framerates at 1080p jumped from 45-50 to an average of 110. This is but one small example. The fans are much quieter and overall the card runs much cooler. According to HWMonitor Pro, on Idle it runs about 43 Celsius and the highest I've seen under load is about 90 celsius. I had bought a GeForce 1050 Ti, but I believe this outperforms that card as well. Definitely worth the money if you're looking to upgrade your rig. The system specs are as follows:

So this was a solid model other than graphics card.
Even with the increased prices right now for 189.99 current full price, this 4 gb DDR5 GPU made my computer run pretty much anything in 'high'. I was impressed because I wasn't expecting that.

Later on I ended up getting an AlienWare Aurora R7 with a NVidia gforce GTX 1070 8 gig video card, as much as I like this PC... it isn't that much better than my 2 yr old CP was with the RX 560. The Alien Ware is much quieter, and obviously runs a little smoother....

But for people with a relatively limited budget and an already decent rig, this video card will allow you to play any current game. at the time of this review. Maybe not in High, but at least in medium for the full 60 fps. For example I could put COD black ops 3 in HIGH accross the board without much stuttering, didn't try GTA 5"^5^Mar 9, 2018 5:02 AM

I've had this card for 5 months now and it's already died. This card is nearly incompatible with windows 10. By that, I mean, you'll maybe get an update from windows, or amd, and poof, your card is ruined. It's not like it slows down, it just ceases to work. You'll lose all power to your display and spend hours trying to figure out how to fix it. Guess what, you won't. Because AMD is refusing to address this problem correctly. If you even wanted to fix this gpu, you'd have to backtrack dozen's of updates, even still, windows 10 may just revert that because, oh well, windows 10 can't be told no anymore.
The good news, this company has a 3 year warranty, the BAD? It's impossible to create an account. They want ALL of your billing information, phone number, full name, email, just to be able to EMAIL THEM. That's not even for the warranty part. 
If you choose to even include that information, guess what, you go to their non-secured web-page(their words) and by the time you've finished? The page has timed out. 

AVOID the hassle, do not purchase this card, or anything with AMD until Microsoft and AMD decide to make their products even remotely compatible without having to use loaner CPU's and GPU's to update drivers and firmware that should already exist."^1^Nov 27, 2018 8:42 PM

Donald^/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-super-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-3-0-graphics-card-black-silver/6361326?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^12^0^"I bought this card for a new build that I was putting together. I paired this card with an i9-9900k and 32gb of 3200mhz ram, I put it all on an Asus Rog Strix z390 E motherboard. I installed everything and booted up the computer, installed everything, opened MSI afterburner and started playing. Mainly I play Apex Legengs right now so that is what I am going to base this review on, I've had the card for two days and have not had a chance to try any other games. Anyways, booting up Apex and leaving everything on mad settings, 1440p 144hz the card runs at 70-95%. Auto boost clock running at 2050 out of the box with no tweaking. I have pretty good airflow, but running this card with these settings the temp peaks at 55c and does not dip below 144hz. So far with performance I am absolutely pleased.

Noise: For me, aesthetics and noise come secondary compared to performance. I play with noise cancelling headphones, and when gaming I have 8 fans spinning up anyways, so I have not really heard the card over the rest of the fans in the case. All I know is that my temps are perfect, and I am happy with it. 

Looks: This card looks amazing in my opinion, it has a pretty simple design and I love it. The card is solid and sturdy. I do wish that the Geforce RTX logo was changeable but I can live with that. 

A couple of side notes: The reason I gave this 4, not 5 stars, is because when installing the GPU into the mother board for the first time the bracket and the PCI slot were not lining up. After further inspection I found that the mounting bracket was bent at the top where it slides into the case, maybe 2 off. I bent the bracket straight by hand, and it went right in. Although I would prefer to not recieve a card bent out of the box, it works perfect and I'm not waiting for a replacement. Maybe Nvidia can chime in to how a $700 GPU comes with a bent bracket out of the box?
Also, and this has no effect on my review, the first day I had the card in everything ran perfect. My temps were slightly higher, but that was because I didnt plan far enough ahead to realize that the mother board only offers 2 Chassis Fan Headers and a couple others, so I only had 3 fans running in the case. Since all my fans are corsair and I did not want to buy splitters, I purchased a commander pro to control fan speed and RGB. To get the iCue software to control the PWM fan speeds, I had to update iCue to the latest version. I put everything in, booted up, upgraded, played with my speeds, and started playing. My gameplay went from 144fps butter smooth, to 100-120fps and stuttering. I couldn't shoot anything. I thought maybe I plugged something back in wrong. After troubleshooting I figured out that the iCue software is the root of the problem. Uninstalling iCue and rebooting the game, everything goes back to normal. 

Would I buy it again? Yes I would."^4^Sep 9, 2019 4:05 PM
Christian^/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-super-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-3-0-graphics-card-black-silver/6361326?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^8^1^"Is RTX worth it? depends. The hardware on this card is solid. It is overclockable, i'm using MSI Afterburner; over 2Ghz boost. The Control game is amazing to experience RTX. I would recommend it if you play story based games (Cyberpunk 2077 can't wait!). I wouldn't use it in FPS games like Battlefield.

As the Nvidia drivers become more stable and optimized to use RTX the card will continue to be better. Full load temperatures 60-75C. Obviously it's gonna run a little bit warmer but they designed the fans very well - quiet @ 60% fan curve.

I got this card for high frame rate 1080p 144-240hz however it can definitely handle 1440p very well. If you want 4k with high fps and settings then you're gonna have to buy the 2080ti. If you're looking for a new GPU and don't care for RTX, get an board partner 5700xt @ $399-450 for 2070 super equivalent performance (*not capable of RTX reminder*). recommend having Gen 7 i7 or newer intel processor or good gen 1/2 Ryzen OC 

I upgraded from a GTX 970 3.5GB card. While I thought about getting an EVGA card because of their great reputation and how my 970 still works great. I just didn't see the need to pay the extra price for OC that I would do higher anyways and a couple C difference. These cards are very pricey but for an enthusiast, you can't get anything better."^5^Aug 28, 2019 5:23 PM

Perfect fit, the only downside are the blowers. They blow up and out rather than through and out. So I reversed the fans to exhaust on the case and when I'm really gaming and OC I keep the Amp case cracked.

Steady OC at 125 on memory and 500 on core. Able to run Final Fantasy Online maxed at 4k 60fps. Control runs 1440p 60fps with RTX on medium. Control with RTX on high requires 1080p. Most if not all games I own are now maxed at either 4k or 1440p.

This should be helpful for all Alienware and Amp owners:
1. Uninstall all display drivers
2. Download GeForce Experience and let it install your built-in GPU driver
3. Shutdown
4. Plug in Amp and boot
5. Notice your card has generic Microsoft adapter
6. Right click that card in device manager
7. Update driver by pointing to the GeForce Experience download file
8. Let the driver install
9. DONE

Update BIOS to latest and Windows 10 to 1903 minimum for RTX features.

Highly recommend this card for the Alienware and Amp combo."^5^Feb 16, 2020 5:53 PM

The first thing I noticed when getting into a game (Ghost Recon: Breakpoint) was the SUPER LOUD high pitch whine the card was making. It wasn't a fan noise but more of an inductor noise. You can be in-game and go into the pause menu, and the noise will go away. At first, I thought it was my power supply, so I got down and put my ear up to it and the 2080 to try to pinpoint where the insanely annoying sound was coming from. It sure sounded like it was coming from the 2080 instead of my EVGA 1000W PSU so just to be sure, I removed the 2080 and reinstalled the 5700XT. The sound went away. Come to find out and some Google research, this is a pretty common problem on the 2080 Supers and 2080 ti's.

As for performance, I gained about 10 FPS in Breakpoint, compared to the 5700XT, at the same very high (not highest) setting for both cards. I'm using a Ryzen 3600 with 32GB of 3200Mhz DDR4 Ram, the CPU utilization never goes above 50% and the GPU utilization stays pegged out so I'm pretty sure I'm not running into a CPU bottleneck. But thinking about it, it costs roughly $300 for 10-20(max) more frames. I think that's a very crappy deal when looking at performance per dollar. And yeah, that was the only game I personally tested, but after hearing the horrible sound the card makes, I already know I do not want it.

I do plan to return this specific card soon but will exchange it for another brand 2080 Super. If youre thinking about this card, just beware of the noise issue and the competition which is a lot cheaper for just a small performance loss. The 2080 Super is probably an overall nice card, I just wouldn't recommend this Nvidia branded card."^2^Oct 24, 2019 2:34 AM

It took some serious dedication! It kept selling out everywhere! Being that Best Buy's product page had newly launched (~11-27-2019), I decided to focus solely on it. Periodically (sometimes obsessively) refreshing the page for days was well worth the time. On the morning of 11/30/2019 at approximately ~8:21am, I was shocked when the 'Sold Out' button briefly turned into 'Add to Cart.' When it happened, I was nearly floored! I immediately thought, 'How many more people are seeing this with me?!' My anxiety levels went into overdrive! I have never clicked through the checkout process so quickly in my life! Had I been using the Best Buy app on my phone, I probably would have dropped it. Lol.

Anyhow, like everyone else interested in this processor, I had been reading/watching all of the reviews for it. The results are astounding! It's unlike anything we've seen in the mainstream consumer space before. I have no reservations in saying that the AMD Ryzen 9 3950X is nothing short of spectacular! No matter the task (gaming, content creation, streaming, etc), the 3950X rises to the occasion, and will continue to do so for many years to come.

I was actually leaning towards a Threadripper 3960X as I wasn't sure if the amount of PCI-E 4.0 lanes on the AM4 platform were going to be enough. Once the 24/16 lane count from a combination of the CPU/X570 chipset were confirmed, I knew that a total 40 lanes would suit me just fine.

This new rig is replacing my build from March 2017. Over the last two and a half years, the only parts I've upgraded on it are the power supply and graphics card, both of which I'll be carrying over to the new build. I purchased everything else I needed for the new build week ending 11-23-2019. The processor was all that remained. I got lucky!

Best Buy estimated it to be delivered on Wed 12-4-2019, but UPS had it at my local facility on Tue 11-3-2019, scheduled for delivery the same day! Best Buy sent me a very festive email, excitedly proclaiming that my package was arriving a day earlier! Things couldn't get any better! I waited and waited until, boom, the UPS truck arrived at 12:20pm! I was at the door waiting patiently. He walked up and delivered my new tower, second NVMe drive, and nothing else. I asked if there were any more packages. He said those are the only items set for delivery to my address. As he walked away, my heart sank. I immediately brought up the app. The 3950X was still scheduled for delivery. All was not lost!

After waiting for around thirty minutes or so, I opened the app again. An exception occurred at 12:23pm. As I read the status of my package, it felt like time stood still. 'Due to operating conditions, your package may be delayed.' Dang it. That was the last thing I was expecting to see. Oh, well. I called UPS to find out what was going on. The first guy I talked to told me that the scans I see on the website and app are just labels, and that UPS doesn't have physical possession of my package. Wait. What? You cannot be serious. How so? He said the package is considered lost, and didn't seem interested in discussing it any further. He actually insisted that we file a report.

I was sick to my stomach at the thought of my CPU being lost, and the claims process ahead of me. I couldn't accept that answer, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was finally connected to someone with access to more information. She reassured me that UPS was indeed in possession of my package. She went on to say that it was left at the facility by the driver and would be delivered the next available business day. I told her that I would be more than happy to go pick it up myself. She went ahead requested a same day hold for me. I drove over to the local facility (~9 minutes) and talked to someone. Turns out, my package was there, but on a truck that was waiting to be unloaded/sorted. There was no way I could get the package that day. Sigh. I returned home. I reasoned that it wasn't the end of the world. Besides, it was a day early anyway.

So, after a minor setback, I received my package today (12-4-2019). I'm excited and can't wait to get started. Sorry for such a long story. Thanks for reading.

Good luck to everyone else trying to get their hands on this elusive part.

Beradon^/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-16-core-3-5-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6391901?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^10^0^"When I read that AMD was going to be releasing this processor, I knew this was the one for me.  As with many, I saw it immediately go out of stock on most major retailers instantly on the day of release but lucked out being cable to catch one at Best Buy a few days later.  Best Buy is also one of the very few that hasn't started to jack the price up at this point because of demand as well, so that just further increases my respect for this company.  That aside, this is a review about the processor.

This processor is fast.  More than that, it has a lot going for it that is beyond most of the current offerings from either AMD or Intel.  In the forefront is the fact that this processor is not only the highest core and thread count of any non-HEDT processor currently, but it is also the highest clock speed of any current AMD processor.  At this speed it easily trades blows with Intel's top of the line 9900K in many cases, and I could see it start skewing more in the favor of the Zen2 series as optimization improves with games, drivers and Windows itself (with AGESA 1.0.0.4B and improved power plans from Microsoft for Windows 10 we're already seeing this happen).

In addition, this processor is PCIE 4.0 capable, which no current Intel offering even supports.  This was a major deciding factor when I was in the market for a new chip as with the relative infrequency that I find myself in the position to upgrade, I didn't want to come to a point in a year or two from now where I wanted some PCIE 4.0 capable storage or graphics but not able to use it due to lack of support.

I plan on using this processor not only as a gaming processor, but also to support streaming and VMware capabilities, all of which it is capable of doing without breaking a sweat due to the insane number of cores and threads.

I am running it with a Corsair H100i AIO cooler with fans in a push-pull configuration and have not seen it go above 64'C under full benchmark load.

Paired with my 2080TI, I am not seeing anything that can come close to stressing my system.

There is a downside to moving from Intel to AMD as I did with this build.  I have been using Intel since the first gen core-i series (i7-860k) and only moved to AMD at this point because the performance ball was finally in the AMD court.  But the downside to moving here was the loss of Intel RST raid.  I understand that motherboard raid is a controversial feature, some love it, some think it's awful, but either way, I've been using it for years, and because I was moving from board-to-board that was all Intel, I didn't have to rebuild my storage array.  Moving from Intel to AMD required me to rebuild my array (which also made me re-think using onboard raid, and indeed I've now moved to Microsoft Storage Spaces).  Why am I even mentioning this?  Intel's RST is dramatically *DRAMATICALLY* easier to configure and use than AMD's RaidXpert2.  I ran into many issues with AMD RaidXpert2 including an inability to remove a drive from RAID to use a standalone without using a third party tool to blow away the partition information that RaidXpert2 places on it when you initialize the drive.  I dont feel I should need to use a third party tool just to disable RAID on a drive.  In addition, there were issues in the creation of the raid that resulted in some dataloss for me, which was unfortunate.  I would suggest that unless you absolutely require it, avoid using AMD's RaidXpert2 onboard RAID.

All in all, I would easily recommend this to anyone, provided they understand the strengths of this processor.  This is not going to be the fastest processor for everyone.  While it does excel in both games and productivity, if you are purely gaming this may not be the best choice.  It is also not an excessively great overclocking chip as AMD has already pushed this package so close to the edge."^5^Dec 21, 2019 11:34 PM
WMicke^/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-16-core-3-5-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6391901?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^9^3^"To start off, I have to admit that this is my 3rd AMD-based computer that I have built from 2010 until today.  Despite this, I don't think that I would consider myself an 'AMD fanboy' I've simply always liked AMD CPU's from a price vs performance perspective.  Originally I looked to AMD because it was more affordable, but now, even when I could have afforded an Intel i9 9900 KS, I chose the AMD Ryzen 9 3950X.  Why?  Because right now it's simply the best CPU on the market.  Sure, Intel might beat out the 3950X on a few lightly threaded gaming benchmarks (although the 3950X is always extremely close), but when it comes to gaming, I don't know anyone who games that way anymore.  I won't just have a game open, I'll have the game, and I'll have Discord, and I'll have Browser Windows (probably with at least half a dozen or more tabs open), and maybe a webcam, or perhaps a stream deck...  and running multiple simultaneous apps is where the Ryzen 9 3950X shines.  Oh, and when it comes time to stop gaming and actual try to get some productivity tasks done?  Not even a contest.  AMD wins every time.

The only thing I will add, is that when it comes to getting the most from your Ryzen 9 3950X, please make sure that you download the latest BIOS and motherboard updates from you motherboard manufacturer, and any available chipset updates from AMD... but most importantly download AMD's Ryzen Master software, it makes tweaking your CPU and RAM clock speeds as simple as adjusting a slider, and it does an excellent job of checking stability (when you click the 'apply and test' button) after you make any changes.  Those simple updates easily gave me an extra 5-10% performance, and can help you avoid any headaches."^5^Dec 31, 2019 1:57 PM

aarondr^/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-16-core-3-5-ghz-socket-am4-desktop-processor/6391901?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^1^"The 3950x is as everyone says: an excellent chip. It's fast, has tons of cores, tons of threads, and plenty of frequency to go around.  It's kind of amazing to think not even 3 years ago we were stuck with 4 cores 8 threads on desktop.  AMD has multiplied that by 4 to get us 16 cores, 32 threads.  And this is no slouch either, straight up beating a 10980xe in head to head despite having 2 fewer cores.

Like most Ryzen, you won't get tons of overclocking headroom like Intel.  Coming from a HEDT Intel chip before this, I was used to finding the right voltage, heat, and frequency to get the most out of my chip.  Ryzen 3rd gen especially is a temperamental animal, and essentially cranked to 11 by default.  This is less of a reflection on Ryzen, and more of just how they have their CPUs tweaked.  The Ryzen architecture has never scaled especially high like Skylake, but it really doesn't need to to get equivalent performance.

Ryzen is by far a different flavor, even compared to the old XP, and FX series from AMD and prior.  I have been buying AMD and Intel for years, and Ryzen is the first real deathknell to CPU tweakers - but not because of imposed restrictions, but because the chip manages its boost so well.  Sure you can overclock RAM, and tweak timings - or even do an all core OC or per CCX OC - but non of this nets much really.  This isn't knocking the chip at all, but rather the reality that overclocking (the CPU at least) may be mostly dead for anything but sub-ambient cooling.

The biggest cons of this chip are: 
* No included cooler (while the 3900x gets the pretty Wraith prism, the extra $250 here gets you no cooler and just 1 more chip-let -albeit a better binned one).  
* HEDT performance without HEDT features (you get the same mainstream X570 limitations on PCIe lanes - albeit they are 4.0 speeds at least and support for a paltry - hehe - 128GB of RAM).

Both of the above cons are really just more FYIs.  Beast-mode builders of gaming/streaming rigs won't really care about either of the above, but professional are even more segregated to using threadripper.

This is a super fast chip.  If you were considering HEDT platforms before, this wipes the floor with everything, even previous threadrippers must bow to the superior per thread performance of the 3950x.  This CPU costs a pretty penny, but its sure to be relevant for quite a while.  Someday it may end up powering my NAS, but for now it's the fastest CPU around barring 3rd gen threadripper."^5^Feb 15, 2020 1:02 AM

I found that at least in the games I play, if I disable or lower the bells and whistles, it will hold a playable frame rate at 4k (3840 x 2160) between 50-60 FPS with some dips below that during very heavy action, but nothing unsettling. To do this I had to make sure those games were set to Fullscreen mode. When windowed, performance dropped substantially.

Now, granted my experience is not going to hold true for every game or every PC setup, but it's worked for me. As with everything PC related, you have to find what works best for your situation. 

Anyway, if you want a highly capable mid-range GPU then this is a great one to look at, and I'm more than pleased with it.

They are pretty solid on the whole, but this one definitely needs some tweaking out of the box. The great thing about this is XFX somewhat encourages it, as long as you aren't being obtuse.

I love this card. It might not seem like much of a step up from an RX 480 on paper, but there is a noticeable improvement to frametimes in some of my favorite games. Finally I can enjoy things at my monitor's higher refresh rates!

There were some teething issues during the first couple hours. I looked up a review on the card after experiencing temperatures above 80C. Turns out this is a dual-bios card with a dip-switch for changing between the two. Unfortunately, XFX ships this card set to the 'quiet' fan setting, it would seem. Before install I would recommend flipping that switch!

Even at that though, with higher fan speeds and lower temperatures, I still wasn't quite happy with what I was seeing. There were numerous dips in Vcore and core clock during gaming and benchmarks. After reading reviews on another site, I stumbled across a really decent fix for it!

You see, AMD are pretty awesome about things. Their driver suite just comes with overclocking capabilities that are quite easy to set up. So I took that reviews advice and increased the power target by 15% and set a more aggressive fan curve. (I've attached a screenshot of which settings I used in the driver control panel to get more stable performance.) 

Results? Buttery-smooth performance and some decent temperatures to boot! The drawback with the RX 590 in general is the power consumption. It has stellar performance for its price (Especially during the 50th sales) but it comes with a power cost.

I routinely see a power draw over 200 watts just for the GPU die (according to GPU-Z.) Not even taking into account the rest of the board. This isn't an issue if you have a good power supply and decent airflow, but I would be hesitant to try this card on older or budget builds. If you do have an older setup and are worried about power, just get a decent (as in 550w+) 80+ Gold or better with plenty on the 12v rail and you're good. You can also get some pretty well-performing cases for a song online. All a matter of how tenacious you are, hehe.

All-in-all I'm blown away by the performance-per-dollar of this card. The drawbacks are negligible, especially remembering cards like the R9 300-series where power was very much off the charts. The 12nm refresh does well by this architecture, with the only tradeoff I can see being increased power consumption. There are more eco-friendly options out there for sure, but you wont find this level of performance for the price!"^5^May 4, 2019 8:34 AM

AMD updates the driver every few weekswhich is nice in some respects and annoying in others. At least they pay attention to their customers post-sale. However...every few months it seems I have to go back to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter and reinstall AMD software all over again because the driver suddenly doesn't work at all.

RuggedSpudd^/corsair-crystal-series-570x-rgb-atx-mid-tower-case-mirror-black/6237540?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^1^"I love the way this case looks so much. It is beautiful, great craftsmanship, decent cable management, and good airflow. It is very heavy, as should be expected with 4 glass panels. The mirror black looks amazing because when its off you cant see in it at all, but when you turn it on, the rgb shines through great. You must be careful with the panels and the stand offs for the top and front panel though, as they are plastic. Just be mindful! 

I replaced the fans, so I have 6 Corsair ll120 fans, 2 on my h100i rad at the top, 3 in the front, and one in the back. Rgb strips, of corse. Definitely great for looks. 

Some complaints though, the sp120 fans it comes with are older Corsair fans and they are loud with limited rgb options. You must also be prepared to buy a second fan hub, and at least a lighting node pro. Even replacing the fans, the logo is registered in Icue as an so fan so it needs its own hub. 
So lnp channel one is used for my 6 ll120s connected to a fan hub. The second lnp channel is used for the logo. If you want strips you need another lighting node pro. And you need to be really good at cable management. 
Instead, I got the commander pro, to give me more control. 

Expect to spend more money. 

And the reason I didnt give it five stars, the logo for the psu shroud didnt not work at all, with the fan controller. When I hooked it up to my lnp, it is seen by the icue software, and I can turn the light on, but it flickers, a lot. Like randomly turns off and on to the point where I have it turned off right now. 

I have my fan hub connected to my commander pro, and my strips and psu shroud connected to the lnp. I am going to try moving the strips to the commander pro so that the only thing on the lnp is the psu shroud to see if that helps. Hours of research shows that this issue is common though. So be prepaired for that. 

Also, fingerprints everywhere. Its easy to fix and should be obvious that this would happen but still worth noting. 

Otherwise I love it, and if I can get the psu shroud led to work properly, I would give it five stars in a heartbeat."^4^Mar 24, 2019 4:00 PM
oprib^/corsair-crystal-series-570x-rgb-atx-mid-tower-case-mirror-black/6237540?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^7^2^"Let me say that this has the best looks I've seen in a new case in a long time being sleek and sexy. However, with it being mostly glass you have the downside of fingerprints and smudges however they come out easy with a microfiber cloth that most should own and if you don't you're going to need it with this case. From the cable management to the included RGB I can't complain. The front IO has ample features and enough room for a double rad up top or triple rad on the front (I have and have tried both and both fit comfortably). I have ran dual 1080ti's and a 7900k (not a flex) and have had no issues with cooling or dust as the built in filters work perfectly and enough cooling to run a 7980xe Easily if you truly wanted. Corsair has hit the mark on this one and I love it. BONUS- the fans included are full RGB for all those who want to RGB everything and they are pretty decent quality as corsair is the king of fans (IMO). 

Cons- Water-cooling (if you wanted) would be somewhat tight however you could still absolutely do it. Nothing else to mention as it's a pretty darn good system and why I keep coming back to corsair. 

Design- 10/10 from cable management to the airflow, no detail was overlooked and this is truly 

Durability- 10/10 and you're probably like 'but its all glass' and you're exactly right. You knew what you were getting into and you will have to be a little more careful since this is mostly tempered glass however it's not going to break for no reason and everything else is made to a high quality. For this I give it a 10 because you can tell in looks, feel and heft that it's going to last. 

Quality- 10/10 I cant complain about anything and haven't had any issues. Corsair is known for its quality and customer service. 

Cost- 8.5/10 you pay a little more because its all glass and as always the RGB tax. I wish it wasn't as pricey but I don't regret paying for it either. 

Practicality- not going to give a score for this as this is more of an enthusiast level case and you're paying for things you don't need like RGB (that can be argued for some of you), all of the glass and so forth. You buy this because its sexy and the best, you can get a $50 case that cools and will do fine but you pay the big money because this is the finest looking baddie you can get. 

Conclusion- If you have some extra money left over in your budget and you want the best looking case that catches eyes this is THE case. Even my enthusiast friends drool over this and I wish they made one big enough for an E-ATX and I would have 7 of these sitting around. Would absolutely buy again no regrets.

Powl2019^/corsair-crystal-series-570x-rgb-atx-mid-tower-case-mirror-black/6237540?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^1^0^"Don't take me wrong, this product does offer a lot of qualities for a case, but not for an enthusiast.   As an enthusiast you want to feel that you have options on a build, but not limited to them.  However, I do like the temper mirror glass panels.

I couldn't place a 360 mm radiator on top because it doesn't allow enough space to fit a motherboard.  Maybe a 240 mm can, but I wanted a 360mm, so it has to go on the front of the case.

I agree with one of the reviews mentioned that you are going to have difficulties managing more fan lights, and expect to spend more money.  I purchased 2 kits of LL120, because the SP120 that comes with the case doesn't have the many cool features like LL120 have or the HD120 for that matter. 

You can only control the fans lights (SP120) and the two Corsair logos from the three buttons on top of the case.  With the provided RGB hub you are limited to just add two more connections because one of them is being used by the two Corsair logos.  You may be able to control all of the lights using the ICUE software, but then you will forgo the functionality of the three buttons on top of the case, thus, defeating its purpose.

A better purchase, in my opinion, will be the Corsair 500D SE RGB, and even though it may cost about $80 more, you will save more money because it comes with 3 LL120 fan lights (These lights are the best I have seen so far in the RGB market) and the commander PRO which roughly valued altogether is anywhere between $180 to $200."^3^Oct 25, 2019 9:21 AM

The image does not represents the cases greatly as I thought I was buying a frosted tempered glass, after seeing the reviews after purchasing I was glad I made that mistake as it is gorgeous. The only down side is opening the case you have to unscrew the glass then set the heavy piece aside making sure it doesn't get scratched or broken. While there they include 3 corsair rbg light fans, I wish there was one exhaust fan which is also confusing because its manual says that there is one included.

Can't put 280 mm radiator in the top, despite the top being set up for two 140 fans. If you put it in front, you'll need to switch out the 3x120 fans for 2x140 fans, detracting from the appearance of the front of the case, and creating minor extra wiring headaches. You can make the three fans from the front go in the top, but you'll need to figure out an alternate means of fastening the bracket they mount on to the frame of the case. Cable management setup could be better. Standoffs for the motherboard didn't quite line up right. Build was a PITA. Not a particularly well designed case, and just not worth the money, IMO."^2^Jun 23, 2019 2:29 PM

You may or may not be able to get 3000mhz speed on your cpu depending on your motherboard and motherboard bios, initially i was only getting 2933mhz until a bios update. 
You can always go with faster memory for ryzen but the difference between 3000mhz and 3200mhz isn't much in terms of performance gain and you'll usually end up spending a fair bit more.

It's not that large, has a nice acrylic side panel.

The issue is that the case cannot accommodate dual fan liquid coolers.  The interior is pretty tight and there is no clearance for a 240mm radiator in the front or top (the height of the radiator and fans will block the motherboard mounting).  This means you will have to get either a large air cooler or a single fan liquid cooler.

This will restrict the case to lower powered CPUs as CPUs such as the AMD 3900X or Intel i7 9700K or i9 9900K will not be cooled properly.

The case has mounts for five 120mm fans (two front, two top and one rear).

I was able to install an Intel i7 6700K with a Gemini S524 air cooler with no issues on a MSi Z170 Gaming Pro board.  I generally like the look and design, I just wish that the case was a tad larger to accommodate AIO 240mm radiators.

The card looked and felt very high quality with its constructions one thing i was surprised in is how the fan only runs when it needs to so less noise and power consumption for your system so dont panic if you dont see the fan running . 
There is no power connectors for this card so its and easy install.
Now on to the software the install was a breeze and the whole platform is well laid out and easy to understand but there is one thing i noticed in my system is it would not let me update the software so i had to go back to the XFX website and download the update from there so not a big issue but just FYI..

Bought this for a new Ryzen based system I was building. I initially installed it in my previous workstation to see what it could do for the older FX-6300 machine I had been working on. Initially, Windows 10 identified the card, and installed drivers. Nothing but problems, until I installed the factory software and drivers. After that, random crashes in both Adobe Premiere and After Effects. That said, when it was working, the Open CL of this card boosted performance far past what I expected in both responsiveness and renders, vs the NVidia card I had previously been using. After building the Ryzen system, I still had a few random crashes in After Effects, but this was due to an incompatibility with an older plug-in I was using. Can't fault it there. Overall performance is much better than expected; it and the Ryzen processor had some impressive results in Cinebench, and renders in Lightwave 3D are at least 300% faster with the graphics card/processor combo. For the price, I reckon this to be a great entry level card for gamers. It certainly has boosted my productivity in editing HD, and now even 4K is a breeze."^5^Aug 29, 2018 9:31 PM

The only reason why the product gets a 4 star instead of 5, is its own competition: the Radeon RX 560. Best buy tends to sell that card for about $10-$20 more, but the performance increase the card gives, if you can afford it- go with that over this. If you cant, this card is still good for the price.

Thermal: Great! I had no overheating or loudness issues.

Desertfox^/corsair-hd-series-120mm-case-cooling-fan-kit-with-rgb-lighting/5845212?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^0^2^"These fans are overpriced for what they do. One, the screws provided in the box were extremely hard to screw the fans and install into my computer case. I could not use the provided screws as they were extremely difficult to tighten without using brute strength. It felt like I might break them so I had to use the screws from the two fans that came with my case along with extras that was luckily provided for the third Corsair fan. These screws were slightly better but not easy to screw into the holes. Two, I wanted to control these Corsair fans with the JCorsair1 header on my motherboard through software. However, there is no cable provided to do this. The box which my motherboard came in did not include this cable either. The only way I can control them is using the provided Corsair controller.

So I emailed Corsair about a week ago and never got a response back. I had to search Google to look where to find this cable as Corsair does not sell it. There is only one place that sells it and it is about $10.00 and not including shipping costs. This adds already to the overpriced fans.

Overall, these fans are nice and good quality. The RGB lights are bright and the lighting effects are excellent. But I wish that I would not run into issues that I had with them. If I could return them I would. The fans that came with my computer case were quieter than these and I even adjusted the speeds in BIOS. I am sorry I cannot recommend these please go with a different manufacturer. If you love RGB and have to have them then go with these as I believe these are probably the best RGB fans on the market."^1^Jun 21, 2019 6:57 PM

+ Fast rated clock speeds.
+ Easy to set XMP speeds @ 2933Mhz OC on Ryzen platform (if you're motherboard supports it)
+ Reliable performance
+ Pretty lights

Cons:
- Requires another third-party program (Corsair Link) to be installed to set the RGB options for anything other than default Rainbow
- Can be tricky to get working properly on some Ryzen platform motherboards at rated speeds other than default speed of 2133MHz (this is more a limitation of individual motherboards, BIOS firmware and the still maturing Ryzen platform than a fault of the RAM itself)

Other thoughts:
Tried to run this set of RAM at XMP speeds @ 2933MHz on my first motherboard, the Gigabyte AORUS X370 Gaming K5, and it wouldn't post at any speed besides 2133MHz. After failing to run two sets of RAM at supported XMP profiles (I tried a set of PNY Anarchy-X RAM @ 3200MHz), I decide to RMA that board and purchase an ASUS Prime X370-A motherboard. I'm glad to report this RAM runs solid and fast on that motherboard with a Ryzen 1600 CPU with no issues. The RGB is a cool feature, that whilst unnecessary does look neat in my clear panel case. Using the Corsair Link program I can choose from many RGB options. Only downside is that you have to use that program to set the option, when most motherboards support some sort of native RGB functions already. Also, couldn't seem to find anything other than solid red color, but couldn't make it pulse or breath one solid color, just in different colors FYI. The RAM's RGBs still stay lit when computer is in sleep mode so if your rig is in a room where people sleep, you may want to fully shut your computer down when you go to sleep instead of letting the computer go into Sleep mode. All minor quibbles and not enough to knock a star. Again, very pleased with this product and loving it in my new build!"^5^Mar 10, 2018 5:49 AM

The return process was quick and simple, which is a nice change of pace from having to RMA through Newegg. As for the product itself, the kit runs at XMP profile speeds and the RGB LED lighting is an excellent touch to really make the motherboard pop. 

My only functionality complaint is that the RGB LED's continue to stay on if the machine has been put to 'sleep.' 

The Corsair Link software that controls the lighting and monitors temps is easy to use and works with most Corsair products.

This is exactly what I needed. Due to clearance issue with my cpu cooler I couldnt use the newer (cool?) styled memory as it wouldnt fit. This did fit perfectly and was recognized up the system at reboot. Adding memory is the easiest way to upgrade your system. But before adding I would suggest you review these 3 questions when considering upgrading;

1) Make sure your motherboard supports the amount of memory you want to add and whether it uses dual channel or not.

2) If using Windows - make sure you have 64 bit system, as 32 but will only use 4GB of memory even if you have more. 

3) Make sure what memory your system is using as they are not backward compatible due to the different pins. (DDR2 (old), DDR3 (not as old), DDR4 (current).

When I found the right processor for my build, a Ryzen 5 2600x, I needed to find the perfect motherboard to complement that component. Building on a budget, I was looking at MSI's motherboards and really wanted something that came ready for Ryzen's 2nd generation processors so I wouldn't have to worry about flashing the BIOS. The MSI B450 delivered on that promise and it was pretty much plug and play from there installing all my components on this board.

I also wanted a motherboard that could handle DDR4 memory at 3000MHz. Again, not a problem with this motherboard. Since it also supports up to 64GB, it will still be able to grow with me as I upgrade this rig. These are even built with overclocking in mind, though that is something I haven't done yet. It's really built for people who want to build mid to high-end gaming rigs and they thought of everything a gamer would want. 

Cosmetic wise, this piece is beautiful. The gun metal colors around the motherboard's branding is a beautiful touch, there are some RGB lights built in to light up your case, and it just looks amazing when paired with everything else. 

To me, this is a budget board that does far beyond what other more expensive boards will do for you and for that I'm grateful that I was able to find this board and make my first gaming rig a reality."^5^Nov 25, 2018 8:19 PM

- Overclocks
- Uses hi-end media software such as Adobe Creative Suite or PROtools.
- Hosts dedicated servers for various games.
- Uses resource intensive applications

If you are looking to build a 'future-proof' machine I would also suggest this simply because if you are not doing any of the above there is not a single application or process that will be using all of this RAM up - unless there is a memory leak or the application itself is not optimized correctly.

The best thing about this RAM however - the main reason I bought it personally - was because of it only being 2 chips and not 4. Your best bet would be to buy two of these for a total of 32GB of RAM if you only have 4 memory expansion slots on your mobo (motherboard)."^5^Mar 9, 2013 6:19 AM

Have always had great experiences with ASUS boards, and this one was no exception. Runs flawlessly with my 3900x and even though there isn't a lot of overclocking headroom on these CPUs the capability is as you would expect on an enthusiast's board like the Crosshair. No installation hiccups at all except for AURA, and well at the end of the day, that is just for fun. 

Dont forget the PCI 4.0 SSD, so worth it, and if you are paying for an X570 you gotta have it! I got the Corsair and it works as advertised.

I would have probably gone for the wi-fi version if BB stocked it, but love the easy support I get from BB if there ever is a problem, so I went with this version of the Crosshair. And who wants to support Amazon anyway? :-)

Worst thing about this board is the ASUS Aura software, which is buggy at best, but finally got everything to work. Plan out your RGB accordingly if that is important to you - remember you only have 2 - 5v rgb headers, get a hub if you are doing a lot of lighting. And life is easier if you get compatible Aura products.

That is an understatement. Nvidia uses an application called Geforce Experience to identify the card and install the drivers. I strongly recommend you have that website bookmarked before you install this card.

I was replacing a GTX 1050 2GB card with HDMI and Display ports. Nvidia's GeForce Experience app had already been installed. My machine booted up at 800x600 resolution and the card itself was not identified by Windows. Geforce Experience was nowhere to be found. I had to reinstall it to get the 1650 drivers. If you have never installed a discreate graphics card before from Nvidia, I can tell you from experience this is a common occurance. Be ready to install it again.
 
The PNY has 1 HDMI port and one duel-linked DVI-D connection. Be warned that the DVI-D connection does not work until the drivers are installed. If using a dual monitor setup, make sure to plug into the HDMI port for setup (using a HDMI to DVI-D connector will not work until the drivers are installed).
 
Now for the good news. The graphics delivered from this card are gorgeous. At 1080, running two monitors barely caused the card to pay attention. Running multiple instances of my favorite online game at high quality was consisderably smoother than on the 1050. I cannot vouch for VR or 1440 gaming, but I was extremely satisfied with the performance I received at 1080. 

Also keep in mind that this card runs off the motherboard's power. No extra connectors, no need for a larger power supply. If you have 300 watts, you are good. If you are looking for an entry level gaming graphics card, it may be hard to beat the 1650 unless you are willing to upgrade other computer parts. If you are willing to upgarde power supplies, the 1660ti may be a better value.

-1 star for the terrible driver install process."^4^May 8, 2019 12:10 AM

Out of the box the card boosted to 1980 Mhz on the core clock according to GPU-Z during Metro Exodus gameplay, due to Nvidia's GPU Boost. It hovered around 1965 when it wasn't at 1980. The temperature reached a maximum of 67'C in my mini-ITX ThermalTake Core V1 case (accompanied by 6 other fans, mind you). Fans stay off until card reaches 60'C, and were mildly audible when they did spin. After implementing a custom fan profile in MSI Afterburner, core clock boosted to a max of 2010 Mhz and temp rose to max of 68'C. This was in a room with ambient temperature of 72'F. Overclocking the card by adding +100 Mhz to core and +800 Mhz to memory in Afterburner resulted in a stable 5.6% performance increase at 1465 Mhz core clock (shown as 1980 boost clock in AF) and 2055 Mhz memory clock (shown as 7801 Mhz in AF) with power slider at 105%. Normal power consumption during Metro Exodus was around 194W at stock settings, and around 204W when overclocked, peaking at 70'C.

It has been able to handle nearly all games at ultra settings at a minimum average of 60 fps (most between 100-144) at 1080p with the exception of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which averaged 58 fps on ultra (with volumetric clouds on medium). Faster ram or CPU (7700k or 8th/9th gen 6/8-core CPU) may result in averages above 60 in this single game, or by overclocking (which did make the average 61 fps). Other games like RE7, Prey, Forza Horizon 4, STEEP, Shadow Warrior 2, Gears of War 4, Apex Legends, Vermintide 2, played above 60 fps at 1440p ultra settings some reaching closer to 100. Even Metro Exodus (which was redeemed with the purchase of this card) played at 1440p 60FPS using this card at ultra (DX11, RTX off, Tessellation off, Hairworks off, and DLSS off) with some lows into the 50s.

The card also supports the new NVENC encoder in OBS and I tried the Max Quality preset for streaming which seemed to be equivalent to x264's Faster Quality preset, so x264 on Fast or better will still produce a higher quality stream. The advantage is reduced CPU usage with NVENC. Fortunately, streams had about 0.1% dropped frames/no latency at 720p 60fps or 1080p 60fps at 6000Mpbs, and the card's usage remained at about 80% utilization with 4.5/6GB of VRAM used during NVENC streaming. 

I opted to not use RTX or DLSS during Metro Exodus to avoid experiencing stutters or frame rate drops (it increases VRAM usage by 800Mb) but when activated in-game, sunlight was more defined, darker areas look harsher and fps dropped from 85 fps average on Ultra to 61 fps average with RTX. Game looks great normally, and even better with ReShade which I believe is what most people should use instead of RTX in this game. 

Overall, great design and cooling provides really good performance for triple A games at 1080p and 1440p. It would be comparable to GTX 1080 but with less VRAM. It is the best RTX 2060 model out of the bunch, and I personally believe it's a better value at $389.99-$399 than RTX 2070s at $529+, whether or not you overclock it."^5^Mar 21, 2019 2:26 AM

However the price on that one shot up and this went down a little. After watching many reviews over the past few months I knew this was one of the top 3 like the other card... but after playing around with it, I think it's the best.

The fans keep this card quite when not gaming but even under full load it's not loud AND they keep the card nice and cool. I see no reason for a 3 fan when the 2 in this card keep it under 70 degrees while gaming with the clock auto boosting to close to 2K Mhz.

After also discovering the 2060 outclassed a GTX 1070 and by 9%~ under-classed a GTX 1070 TI for the same exact cost & performance ratio, I found this to be a far better deal if you wanna talk budget to performance.  

If you can afford 100$~ more go with the RTX 2070 and settle in for a good three years or so before your next upgrade. The 2060 maybe has a good 2 year run before it gets outdated and severely outclassed by anything new gen.

It only had a 310W PSU and an RX 550. To make matters worse, the PSU was proprietary. So when I wanted to upgrade my GPU, that meant buying a very overpriced PSU from HP.

Then came the 1650. I watched so many tech reviews and they panned this card saying the RX 570 was better. Granted, I really wanted to get that card. But the value proposition failed after looking at an upgraded HP PSU.

So I went ahead and got this card and oh my goodness it is night and day. The card is silent, thermals are great, and the gaming experience blows the stock 550 out of the water.

If you are stuck with a proprietary PSU that has a low wattage, get this card. If not, get a 570."^4^Aug 23, 2019 3:48 PM

It's truly amazing how easy Windows 10 makes it to install everything compared to 15 years ago.  My experience with Best Buy however...not so great.  No wonder why online purchasing is kicking retail's back side.  I got to the store at 10 am when they opened, maybe 15 people in the store, double that in employees, I had to ask three of them to get the card out of the lock case, two had no idea what a video card was, looked at me like I had a phallus growing from my forehead.  The third who was able to unlock the case, kept trying to push me into buying the higher end card like the old skit from Super Troopers 'It's just a few bucks more'.  I finally said to the kid, if he didn't get the card I wanted, I was going to put his face into the lock case.

If you own a 1440p monitor, this card was tailored for anyone using that resolution as it drives all current games in ultra settings often above 60 FPS. It can even touch base a bit on 4K displays just don't expect ultra settings and 60FPS. 
My first PC build used AMD components throughout and was an incredible machine. The new one with a 3700x CPU and this graphics card nails it out of the park as well and that's coming from an older 3570k and a Nvidia 980 GPU.
If I had any con for this card it's the fact that it is just the reference card and other manufacturers like Sapphire will likely be coming out with variants that are likely to be cooler in temperature but other than that, it's incredible for what I use it for.

Overall, if you are looking for a cheaper equivalent of a 2070, take a look at this. Look at benchmarks and see for yourself before making your purchase but if you want to save the money, grab this guy."^5^Jul 12, 2019 10:15 AM

 Short of it, is its buggy/poorly optimized and constantly forces unprompted reboot or no display to be shown over display port and static on occasion over hdmi.

I genuinely wanted to like the card as I have a freesync monitor and have always wanted amd products but it just isn't meant to be for now with all of the problems I have had. 

I had this card for about a week, I had ordered it and had it shipped to me (as the stores don't carry it). Install was great and fitment is good in an ATX case. This card performs well, when it works that is. I generally place this card above a standard 2070 most of the time and rarely above the 2070 super, for the price if it worked perfect; it would be excellent as fps in game when its working correctly is amazing for the price, very loud but amazing.

Now to the software and drivers and reliability side of the card. There is next to no stability with this early amd card. I had everything installed and routed perfectly inside my case, but due to poorly optimized drivers and blower cooler this card will consistently blue screen, drivers fail to black screen or forced reboot, or just not work at boot until restart a couple times. I couldn't complete most tasks without a graphics driver or hardware failure. Attempted defrag of a storage drive crashed 10 minutes in due to graphics driver. I would say until things get sorted out with the new architecture you will have issues for several months or more.

Sitting on the desktop for more than a couple minutes with absolutely nothing running was enough to cause a full driver/graphics card failure and I would often run downstairs to grab a drink and come back to find my computer had restarted and sitting on the look screen.

Great card if you don't mind tons and tons of bugs and issues, including complete failure at the worst times (especially with a raid0 setup).

 Returned and purchased a more refined NVIDIA 2080 card and haven't had a single issue since, even runs cooler with 20-40 fps better performance in games at a higher resolution.

Would consider AMD again if they can get the bugs sorted out 'before' launching a product not 'after'.

This card is also very loud when you start pushing the card to the upper limits even with stock clocks and fan curve.

If you're looking to oc the card. Good luck, barely pushed it to a 10 MHz overclock and it failed to even launch any game. Idk if it was a very unlucky lottery but I couldn't even maintain standard game clocks in a very decently ventilated case.

Buy at your own risk, idk recommend waiting a few months for aibs and more refined drivers/software."^2^Aug 16, 2019 8:50 PM

Most of the reviewers and individuals that have this card have been running into major driver issues that could result in the computer black screening/rebooting.

Looks to be a issue with programs like MSI Afterburner and AMD Overlay/Wattman that are causing these issues.

If you even mess with the fan curve so this card does not run at 85-90c that will cause a black screen.

Something is majorly wrong with drivers 19.7.2 and 19.7.1.

Until these issues are confirmed resolved I would advise to stay away from this card.

I am very experienced with this type of hardware and troubleshooting there is nothing that can be done until the drivers are fixed.

The card runs very hot and if fans are turned up it is very very loud I would recommend to wait for aftermarket cooler versions that should be coming out within a month.

Its not modular but not bulky either so cable management is still very achievable if you try. I buy this every time I build budget towers, even super low budget builds.

I figured that it was the fault of my off-brand PS, so went to the store and got this Antec 450W supply and installed it. Sure enough, the buzzing sound in my headphone jack went away, and everything ran smoother and quieter than before.

My only regret is not getting a 500+ W power supply with 2 pci-e rails at the time I bought this. I was impatient and didn't want for mail order, so I got this instead of getting something higher wattage and modular.

Gamers who want to pick and choose what cables they want clogging up their box and/or who want to run higher powered graphics cards or use SLI or Crossfire should probably just save their money and get something better. I want to upgrade my PC with at least an AMD R9 270X, so it looks like I'll have to swap out this PS with a new one."^4^Apr 10, 2014 1:23 AM

However, I have not been able to get it to work yet. I am disturbed at the BAD documentation. There is NO NO NO video showing the basic install process so you don't know what to expect. You only get a piece of paper telling you to go to a website where it tells you to download an app. For Windows 10, I had to go to the Microsoft store and download their free app. But all I got was a Green HD icon and when launched, it showed a full black screen with the green HD logo an some text in the lower right. Nothing else. So I called support at 925-233-2240 and got a recording. They are in California and only work business hours there. But I called at about 3:30 California time and no answer, and no response to my message. I called the next morning and left another message. It is now 7:30 am their time, so maybe they will call. But right now the unit is useless. They do have a website with a troubleshooting database, but no introductory video of how installation should work. They want me to do all the work of reading all their knowledge pages to find a solution. Not impressed. Now many people like this product, so I will come back and fix this when I get a response and it is working, but this is a caveat, and comment about BAD setup documentation. I am old school - I expect competent written and vidoe details on setup and use of a product and I could not even find a YouTube video by reviewers that showed the setup process. I am using Chrome and Windows 10 on a new Intel 8th generation i7 system and have a working wifi and internet. I even downloaded the app to my Android Samsung 10' tablet and got the same exact black screen. See the pictures. I am just trying to get the hard wired system to work."^3^Feb 21, 2018 9:40 AM

As a cordcutter, I'm always looking for a better way to view TV and save money. This device is worth the price and is very easy to install and setup. I was able to scan 39 crystal clear channels using only a flat digital antenna in a window. I suppose if I had a good roof mounted antenna, I would likely get more channels. This is so much simpler than using a TV tuner. You just open the app on your streaming device and scroll through the channel guide for programs to watch. My family likes this very much which makes my life good. The only thing I do not like is the HDHomeRun app, which has a very poor channel guide. I used the following workaround for my specific streaming devices:
1. For my 4K TV, I installed the Live Channels app for Android TV on my Nvidia Shield. This app is nice because it also picks up streaming channels from several other installed apps, so I'm getting about 170 channels. The channel guide in this app is also very good.
2. For my HDTV, I purchased the Channels app from iTunes and installed it on my Apple TV 4. This app is also very nice with an excellent channel guide.
I haven't setup the DVR functionality yet on either device, but I don't expect any problems. I will connect a 1TB HD to my Nvidia Shield and I will probably use my iCloud drive for the Apple TV 4. So far I am very satisfied with my purchase."^5^Jul 6, 2017 3:38 PM

zpenguin^/hdhomerun-connect-duo-tuner-free-live-ota-tv-black/6079607?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^14^1^"HDHomeRun allows you to literally walk around the house with a TV in one hand. This would have been considered just a dream a few years ago and nobody 20 years ago would have dreamed of this. The TV I am describing is actually a tablet (iPad or Android - you supply yourself or sold separately). Although, you should have a fairly good tablet and router to use this product. Since this product does not 'transcode' - i.e. compress the video on the fly, there is a lot of data that has to be carried by your router (recommend AC router or better) and the tablet must be able to process this to avoid pixelation. The video will break up if you are any distance from your router unless you have a good AC1200, AC1750, AC1900, AC3200 dual or triband router. An N router will work, just don't stray too far from your router. Forget about using anything less than an N router - the pixelation and breakup of images make the product unusable. Also, your client (tablet, PC) on the receiving end should be a fairly good/modern product. Don't try to use an end-of-life product and expect good results. Other than that, this product works very well using prescribed good tablet/router combination. Some bugs/minor-glitches on the client software, but they are not too bad. Mainly just start the software on the tablet in landscape (not start the software in portrait orientation) and you should be just fine. In other words, all the bugs are tolerable and if you work around them, the product adds so much convenience and value that you forget about the short-commings. Don't expect perfect from this product, especially considering its pricing as compared to other products. Also, consider that you DO NOT have to pay a subscription like TiVo. The subscription on TiVo is highway robbery compared to free over the air TV and this product (compare, and you will see what I mean). You can pay for a subscription on this product to get a better TV guide (channel listing), but that is optional and only if you want PVR and extended channel listing capability. This is a very good product for the price."^4^Nov 5, 2017 8:32 AM

I have a Synology NAS and a house full of ROKU devices, so I was looking for a solution that could potentially leverage all of this and give some DVR capabilities. I have thought about getting an HDHomeRun for years... and so I jumped in. The device, in and of itself is very stable and the setup is easy. You can download the HDHomeRun DVR app for multiple devices ... EXCEPT THE ROKU!
I had the ability to directly connect it to my NAS and being able to setup to DVR. I did have the ability to access the tuners from the ROKU leveraging the Media Center App and then select the channels individuals from there, but no channel guide or mechanism to schedule a DVR event.

Ultimately, the integration level with ROKU was where it failed for me. I have zero desire to run plex on my NAS so since there isn't a native Roku app for the HDHomeRun it just wasn't going to work for me. 

That being said, the device is quality, the video quality is solid and there are multiple devices you can connect it to: Laptops, XBOX, cellphones... just not the one device that I purchased this for (Roku). 

Needless to say, I returned the device and spent the extra $$$ to get a Tablo. Had it up and running in just a few minutes and is great... but that will be a different review. Do not let my review talk you out of this device (unless you are trying to connect it to your Roku).

My Criteria for Stars is as follows:
1 - Product did not work for primary designated functionality, was poor quality. I would never recommend this product.
2 - Product may have worked for primary functionality, but may also have been poor quality. I would likely not recommend the product.
3 - Product may be useful in some scenarios, but didn't meet my primary needs. Product was likely inferior in quality. I would likely not recommend the product.
4 - Product likely didn't meet all of my needs but was otherwise high quality. I would likely recommend the product with caveats.
5 - Product met or exceeded all of my needs and I would definitely recommend the product."^4^Feb 1, 2019 4:38 PM

Hookup was super-easy and all I had to do was turn it on and was able to watch TV on my mobile devices using the app. The dual tuners are great and I haven't felt limited. I did not need the higher end HomeRun because I planned to use it on setup boxes or mobile devices around my home and I have a pretty good home network. I use an app called Channels to watch TV using Apple TV and Roku. It works great and has a DVR add-on which I run on one of my computers.

I also have a WINDOWS 10 PC running VLC which allows reduced functionality vs. Media Center but which includes recording. Silicon Dust advertises this as a DVR - that is not 100% accurate, but it does enable DVR functions for OTA TV; Silicon Dust also offers a 'Guide' subscription to enhance scheduling if you have no other service. For me, this is a 5* device.

The problem with this device is that you have to hardwire in to your router. If your router is in a difficult position (I.e basement or main floor) the chances are your antenna isn't receiving a whole lot of channels. Therefore, you would only be redistributing a few channels throughout your home over the network. Your box should have the ability to connect via Wifi similar to Airtv. I would also consider a lifetime subscription fee. Cord cutters do not like monthly subscriptions."^2^Dec 19, 2017 10:12 AM

I am now able to focus 'just' on my Apple TV interface to do all my streaming. I chose to use the Channels app on Apple TV - yes, it's not cheap, but it works really well. I have what I consider to be a good antennae - the Mohu Curve in the optimal place in my home. I was able to get that hard-wired into my home network and now I can watch OTA channels on my different Apple TV systems. In Indianapolis, we don't get NBC on any of the streaming TV systems that I am aware of. This way, I can still watch Sunday Night Football on any of my TVs. The Channels app also is great in that it actually has a program guide for OTA channels. The setup happened in the time it took for me to hook up the HDHomeRun unit to my network and then walk down to the basement where I brought up the setup tool - it was already done and waiting for me. Now I can watch local channels on Apple TV, my mobile devices, and even on my computer if I wanted to.

1. To stream to a wall mounted TV that didn't have an antenna connection nearby. I didn't do all my research, so was under the impression I could use Chromecast for this purpose via Plex. Unfortunately that wasn't the case, but was able to use an Amazon Fire TV stick to do this with a native app... and it works very nicely with a good interface. I use this all daily and been happy with performance. Only negative is like a 1-2 second latency to real-time TV if you have the same program on in another room.
2. Plex Pass DVR... this was going to be a bonus to my intentions above, but overall this hasn't been a great experience for me (stutters and lags). I must have something mis-configured since most people seem to be having good luck with this.
3. To watch sporting events while waiting at my kids practices. Again, lack of research in advance - this isn't supported natively. But I did try doing this via Plex Pass... but quality was so poor that it wasn't even worth it. This could be due to my CenturyLink bandwidth.

Since #1 was my main driver for buying this, I'm overall satisfied with product. I occasionally use it on my cell phone if in the garage or something, but the concept of doing this doesn't have a lot of appeal (watching anything on a tiny screen).

However, that's where it fails a bit. Without the Connect, I was able to pick up most channels in my area (Nashville, TN), including the NBC and PBS affiliates that run on Hi-VHF. However, when I plugged in the Connect, it could not pick up these channels, and I tried mounting the indoor antenna several places without luck.

I still would recommend the Connect, despite the drawback. It's possible it could have picked up the Hi-VHF channels if you have an outdoor antenna or one with a longer range.

I purchased this to watch OTA TV on a TV that has no cable drop nearby. Antenna is plumbed into a cable network that functions without issues on other TVs. Heres the outcome on different devices that SiliconDust advertises as compatible with HDHomeRun:

Amazon Fire Stick Gen2 
- Video freezes every 5 seconds for at least one second.
- Audio lags video about 1.5 seconds.
This was tested on a Fire Stick that streams 1080p HD video with no issues. There are several online reviews noting this issue.
Bottom line: Unusable.

Windows 7
- Receives video, but no audio. This is a known issue for which SiliconDust offers three workarounds. 
1. Use an HDMI device. Sorry, does not work thru an HDMI device.
2. Reconfigure the preview application in HDHomeRun Setup applications tab. Theres no applications tab in Setup.
3. Install another audio decoder  no specific steps offered.
Bottom line: HDHomeRun is not plug-n-play on Windows 7; unusable.

- App actually functions as designed on the iPhone. 
But, why one would choose to watch TV on a phone when youre surrounded with full-sized TVs and monitors is beyond me. (Remember, this is Wi-Fi technology which basically limits its use to inside your home.)

Technical Support

David^/hdhomerun-connect-duo-tuner-free-live-ota-tv-black/6079607?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^8^"I was currently a subscriber of TiVo and had the Romeo OTA DVR. This box connects directly to your television with an HDMI cord. I do not however like the $15 a month subscription to TiVo for the channel guide. So I decided to give this a try. 

I connected to my gigabit Ethernet network and accessed it with my Nvidia Shield using live channels app to access it. Even with a gigabit router and all gigabit wired connections, I still found the bitrate to my Nvidia Shield through the network was not what I would have liked. It did appear to me that the TiVo picture was better especially in fast action motion like football. There does tend to be some pixelation of the datastream in fast action with the hdhomerun.

 I did try the hdhomerun app and found it to be user-unfriendly. As far as channel surfing and setting up recordings live channels from Google is superior for now. The only thing I didn't like about live channels from Google was that you could not watch the show you were currently recording you had to wait until the recording was over to watch it.

I think in time these devices will be better but for now I went back to my TiVo roamio OTA. The DVR function there is much better and the picture is clear throughout the show. I am disappointed I really hoped I could get rid of the TiVo but I hate to say that is still a superior product"^3^Aug 21, 2017 12:30 AM

The DVR function is great. but the Plex part has a hard time with the live stream even on the Computer. I can stream the same content on the computer great with the native application. Streaming it with Plex. Plex complains about not having good signal. Not being able to display the resolution and other reasons. I am sure the issue is with Plex not the device. but if that is your reason for getting it. this is still early development on the interface.
The Android TV I reviewed earlier works great with the interface playing the DVR content. can't stream the live tv any better than the phone or computer.

Couple of things you should know. Weak internet connections and poor antenna range and placement will result in glitching, pixelated, frozen pictures. Two annoying drawbacks have me giving it four instead of five stars. For some reason it will intermittently lose lip sync and the guide interface is very rudimentary and amateurish.

It's been a while since I played Diablo 3 on my i7 Desktop (which formerly had a GTX 560 card in it) with Windows 10 but recently decided to start playing some of those games again. Suffice to say Blizzard has been busy updating and since all the updates to both D3 and Starcraft II it didn't run very well (let's just say not at all LOL) so, I had to find a replacement without upgrading my whole computer.

Installation: 
It was super easy to install in a matter of minutes, I simply removed the old card and put this one in. Didn't need to mess with the power supply at all as it is more than large enough (600 W) and in fact, this card didn't need the 6 pin power connections that my old card did! 

The verdict:
For the Blizzard games, the performance overall is a HUGE improvement over the old card - literally night/day difference!! I was hoping for that without spending a ton! For Diablo 3, I was able to crank everything to High and it ran smooth again. The same for Starcraft 2, where I was able to put it to Ultra without any issues - pretty awesome for this card as honestly I didn't think it'd be able to run as smooth as it does. So, I'd imagine most newer games will run just fine for anyone who is looking for a good entry level card. 

For a quick budget-friendly upgrade, this worked great for me and is everything I needed to hold off to upgrade to a completely new PC once I decide to get into VR after it standardizes more. Which brings me to my last note .. It is important to note this card does NOT appear to support VR according to the GeForce Experience Software (which was not a need for me), but it's worth knowing if that's what you are looking for. Outside of that I'd highly recommend this card to get you by if you're looking to upgrade an older card like I had."^5^Jul 23, 2017 5:50 PM

I have played Planetside 2 a lot with this card. Used to play on Low Settings and got ~30 fps. Now I can easily play on Ultra and get 60 fps when doing non-graphic heavy stuff but in the middle of a firefight with lots of other players (as it happens to be in Planetside) it drops to ~25 or so. But you can lower your settings to gain a more consistent frame rate.

I also played COD IW Zombies at the recommended settings (which look great imo) at 60 fps.

Assassins creed black flag can be handled well also. At Ultra settings, the card does struggle. But this card isn't for ultra. At medium to high settings, even on the seas, I easily got a consistent 60 fps.

The setup to just plug and go is easy, and the apps they have work on Win7, Win10, Android no problem.  I think the interface is really nice.
 
The bad: 
Setting up a connection with a NAS connection for the DVR license was painful, especially if you use FreeNAS for a home server. I'm guessing this is why they offer their own network storage solutions years later.

The picture quality is worse through the app than through the antenna at the same point. Very blocky, more cut out distortions. Maybe it was my unit, maybe it's a result of poor transcoding... I'm not sure. I tried upgrading the firmware and it did not help.

I found the unit can run surprisingly hot, much like older Roku boxes. Make sure you leave it some airflow.

My unit died after about 2 years. Maybe mine was a lemon, but I think it performed poorly overall and I used it less and less as time went on.

I was kind of sad when they dropped the cable channel service due to legal reasons. When it was available, it worked perfectly, and seamless with the local channels.

Began having an issue with a VHF OTA channel distorting picture/audio cutting out every few seconds. the signal was near 100%, and the TV tuners built into my TV's didn't have this issue at all.

I opened a support ticket w/ silicondust. they believed the signal for channel 7 (vhf 177mhz) was just too strong for hdhomerun to handle, thus that was the cause of the distortion.

silicondust asked me to remove the amp and report back on the ticket, which i did ~1 week ago, )but of course they're now ignoring the ticket) so:
i removed the amp, which decreased the signal strength by 50%... same issue. i added 9db worth of attenuators, same issue. this is literally the only channel on hdhomerun that has a problem. nnone of my tv's native tuners have issues with this channel.

hdhomerun hasn't responded to the ticket in a week. i've read other complaints on the forum of identical vhf issues, and in the end silicondust basically just ignores the user instead of stepping up to the plate and escalating/resolving

*** for anyone else looking for a solution - buy a Hauppauge WinTV tuner! it has ZERO issues with my vhf channel 7/177mhz. none, zip. and is 100% plex compatible. this is obviously an hdhomerun hardware or software issue. for an 'engineering company' they seem to take very little interest in troubleshooting an obvious flaw.

i've owned 4 of HDHomeRun devices in the past, and they've absolutely lost a customer due to how they've handled (or lack there of) my support ticket as well as many other complaints identical to mine.

I hope this helps someone looking to purchase this device for OTA tuning - beware, they have issues with towers that have strong signals??? and will NOT fix the issue."^1^Aug 11, 2018 10:56 AM

VintonTechGuy^/hdhomerun-connect-quatro-tuner-free-live-ota-tv-black/6079602?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^14^4^"Wow, I didnt expect this to be so easy! Ive been wanting to cut the cord (sorry Directv) for quite some time. I purchased an over-the-air (OTA) antenna, with amplifier, and intended to wire it into the cabling system in my home (using the same input into the splitter where the Directv satellite came in) to feed signal to 5 different outlets / TVs in our home. Then I discovered the HDHomeRun! What, no wires?

I purchased the HDHomeRun and in two simple connections (power and Ethernet cable into a WiFi extender in my garage), I am broadcasting over-the-air TV in HD throughout my home. I chose to buy the Channels app in the Apple App Store which works EXTREMELY well, rather than the free HDHomeRun app (just ok, but works). Now I can broadcast the over-the-air TV signals wirelessly to my families iPhones, iPads, and Apple TVs... WITHOUT WIRES! LOVE IT!

If youre considering cutting the cord, and looking for easy options, then consider the HDHomeRun Connect with multiple tuners as the ideal solution. Youll need a good OTA antenna to capture HD TV signals from broadcasting stations, a good WiFi network in your home (add extenders with Ethernet port if needed, in case you cant get the antenna wired to the HDHomeRun Connect, which must hard-wired to your wireless network router - remember, a wireless extender works fine, too), and download the apps to your Apple devices, and youll be basking in cord-cutter, saving all kinds of money glory!

NOTE: The Channels app works great for Apple products, and I understand theyre moving toward Android, too. I havent tested it with any Android devices (Nvidia Shield TV, etc.), but expect they will get it right when its available. Search for Channels in your devices App Store. 

Lastly, I have recently subscribed to Directv NOW to get ESPN and other favorite non-OTA channels and Premium Channels... and Im still saving over $100 per month compared to Directv satellite service... and still, Im all wireless, and able to watch TV on my iPhone, iPad, or Apple TVs. This enables me to watch TV on my deck now, with a TV and Apple TV on a small cart I can easily move onto the deck, or garage, or driveway... wherever, as long as Im able to access my home WiFi network!"^5^May 16, 2018 5:40 PM

When I got the HDHomeRun home, I kind of chuckled when I read the installation instructions: plug in the cables and go to a website. What shocked me was that that's really it. The website immediately detected my HDHomeRun device and instructed me to download the appropriate installer for the computer I was using (which happened to be a Mac). The software not only installed the client app, but also updated the devices' firmware, and I was up and running in under five minutes. I didn't have to create an account or enter any codes anywhere...it just worked. That's probably the easiest hardware installation I've ever done (and as an IT guy, I've done many)!

From there, I was able to start watching all of my local TV on my Mac. Another couple quick installs got me access to it on my TVs via my Amazon Fire Sticks, my phone, and my iPad. Every app found the HDHomeRun with no configuration needed. Now I can watch local TV on any of my devices, not just my TVs, and the quality is as good (if not better) as with cable. I was also surprised to see how many unique channels are available over the air that aren't on cable.

The next step was to connect the HDHomeRun to my Plex server so that I can record shows and access my local TV over the Internet when I travel. Again, a couple clicks and the Plex server found the HDHomeRun, imported it's channel list, and started downloading a program guide.

I remember how excited I was when we finally got cable on our street when I was a little kid--I could finally watch Nickelodeon at home. Now I'm just as excited that I'll be returning my cable boxes to the cable company in the next few days. I don't watch Nickelodeon anymore, nor do I really watch any of the other 10 million channels I get...I think I will be quite happy with my HDHomeRun (along with my various streaming services) for many years to come."^5^Dec 12, 2017 8:19 AM

I've been going back and forth with HDHomeRun support but they take days to reply and when they do reply, the information is useless. 

From what I've gathered, these devices are very picky about antenna configurations. I have an attic antenna with an distribution system to feed a house with about 6 televisions. They all get decent reception. 

My Quatro on the other hand can't tune into any channels. From what they've indicated, my signal strength is too strong.... 

Better off looking at their other products or a completely different brand altogether."^1^Nov 27, 2017 2:22 PM
Bestie^/hdhomerun-connect-quatro-tuner-free-live-ota-tv-black/6079602?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^5^1^"I purchased the Quatro tuner in November of 2017. No issues. I mostly use Mediaportal (not for newbies) to watch and record my OTA TV, but from time to time use the HDHomeRun app which works just fine and looks decent. I've also done a few trials of Plex, and also had a good experience with the two paired (Plex + Quatro). Overall no complaints. It's true the signal gets weaker everytime you split the incoming signal, and I can understand the frustration some people are having with the Quatro; but if you have a decent antenna with a digital amplifier (digital amplifier is a MUST have), you should be fine. I personally use a Winegard Flatwave -- best antenna out I've come across. Random side note, the Mohu Sky was a $120 joke. Anyhow, this review is about the tuner, and my point being the tuner works only as good as your antenna can pickup the signal."^5^Nov 8, 2018 5:27 PM
Dave^/hdhomerun-connect-quatro-tuner-free-live-ota-tv-black/6079602?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^6^2^"Pros: Reliable when mated to the right set-up, Performs as I expected. The native HD Homerun software for viewing live TV is fast and has great picture/sound quality on the computer, the Fire TV Streaming Box App, and on Android.

Cons: 

Software Limitations:
The software has no traditional grid-based program guide, although the guide it has is still functional, simple to use, and very very quick. You need to pay extra for DVR functionality (or roll your own DVR software solution) and to get extended program guide information multiple days out.

Hardware Limitations:
The tuners are not going to do as great a job at fixing weak antenna signals as you are probably used to with most built-in television tuners like you'd get with a Sony flat-screen TV. Part of that is the nature of sharing 1 signal with 4 tuners (as opposed to just 1 tuner in a TV). However, from my testing, I've observed that it's not entirely the number of tuners, but also the nature of the tuners themselves. They are fairly sensitive to less than ideal signals so for this to work reliably for you, you will need to put in the effort (and possibly some money, if needed) to make sure that your OTA signal coming from the antenna is strong and of good quality. I would suggest looking into a good quality outdoor antenna and a good pre-amp.

The shielding of the device itself could leave a little to be desired. I've noticed that if you move the device around on a desk, your signal quality and strength can change a bit based on the box's proximity to other pieces of computer equipment you have nearby. That hints that the shielding is not as great as it could be."^4^Oct 9, 2018 5:01 PM

Boy am I sorry! The Connect had absolutely no tuning issues in my configuration for the 3+ weeks I had it. I was pleased the Quatro initially detected more channels but I can hardly get it to tune in anything! I get repeatedly 'Unable to play channel' 'No video data'. Quatro struggles with the stronger stations, however, my stations are 50 to 60 miles from me and I only have a 50 mile antenna driving a 6-way passive whole house distribution system! Quatro seems to work better, if you manage to get all 4 tuners on channel and let it thermally heat up. Again, Connect had no tuning issues, nor do my 3 TV tuners presently have, with this setup. Quatro is also lacking the very useful tuner indicator LEDs featured on Connect. I have verified Quatro has the latest firmware and all my devices have the latest client software.

Guess what...SiliconDust made this newest box with a total of 4 tuners. When i found out it was available, I ran out and bought it right away.

I currently have it set up with one of my extend units for a total of 6 tuners. I never have to worry about having enough tuners to watch and record my shows. The unit itself is very small and doesn't take up any space. I have my HDHomeRun devices set up in my garage with an ClearStream Antenna mounted on the roof everything gets sent back by my home network. I get almost 170 channels where I live. Now a lot of them are garbage but i have about 60 channels kept on.

Cons: can't be located outside or in hot locations where it would be closest to the Antenna. Doesn't have wireless so it must be in proximity of a network connection. Doesn't have PPOE so it requires another wire and an outlet near the devices.

Connected it to my network and it was super easy to configure. I configured it on my Plex server and it ran absolutely awesome recognizing 87 digital channels in Houston which I found amazing. The device worked for 30 minutes and then lost ALL channels. Cycled power a dozen times and did the channel scan from scratch. The channel scan now takes about 3 seconds and ZERO channels were found. Called user support at Silicon Dust and it's a recording. Sent two emails to their support over two days and not even an acknowledgement. A TV hooked to the same antenna receives all the aforementioned channels with no issues. I plan to return mine to Best Buy tomorrow. Silicon dust is what I believe is in my HDHomeRun.

The setup was a tiny bit tricky because where I initially tried to install it didn't have a strong enough antenna signal (multiple splitters between antenna and tuner). I had to get a new 2-way splitter that didn't degrade the signal strength so severely, and put the tuner in my attic closer to the antenna; after that, it's worked great."^5^Nov 21, 2017 11:09 AM

The GPU out of the box performs very well, and as an upgrade to a GTX 1080, its great. I play at 3440x1440 and in VR, and honestly this card feel just right for this resolution. Problem is, I have had a 1080ti before. This feels just like a 1080ti. The other problem with that, is the 1080ti is cheaper at the moment. If you're a value minded consumer, this isn't the GPU for you yet. 

I say yet because there is untapped potential in these cards. First, there is the DLSS and RTX capabilities that we are simply waiting to be released. I don't expect anyone to buy on hopes, so I wouldn't recommend this card simply based on that. Nvidia has given us no reason to believe these will be competent cards in that regard, so don't believe they are. Secondly, drivers. If this was pascal (10 series) I wouldn't recommend waiting on drivers to improve performance, but they aren't. This isn't simply a rehash of Nvidias gaming arch of old, this is a pretty fresh arch. I could dive into the techincals of it, but I'll save that for elsewhere. But know that there are new cores in here running alongside the old cores that do things the other archs couldn't. It takes time to optimize these, and thats what happening. How much, I don't know. That said, I don't recommend buying on hope. 

Now, if 1080ti performance is enough for you for a few dollars extra with the hope of better performance later and all the eye candy that comes with ray tracing, or the increased performance with DLSS (at a minor visual hit), then this is the card for you (unless you have 2080ti money). If not, don't buy it. Find yourself a 1080ti thats priced decently, and go with that. It has more raw performance, more memory, and steady drivers."^4^Oct 12, 2018 1:33 AM

So far I am not disappointed. So here is a breakdown to why I recommend it.

1) Performance: Because I also like to stream I try my best to keep up with the new games coming out and having a steady stream is important to me. So far running games such as PUBG and APEX (popular FPS currently) I haven't notice a drop below 60 fps during game play. A match from start to finish has been a smooth ride. on the other side of the spectrum I heavily mod Skyrim and the Witcher 3. Very high graphic games (post Modding with Skyrim) and I have yet to run into any clipping or other issues with rendering objects issues you would see in this game with my much older card. I currently have 4 monitors connected to the card. while one plays the game, another manages the stream, one has the stream open for me to notice any performance issues, and the fourth lets me manage any other media platform i'm also using. to date I have not notice an issue with all this running at once, and the fans on the card are very quite IMO. 

2) Upgrade: I have been rocking a GTX 980 for about 4-5 years and I am able to tell the deference easily with the new upgrade. As I just noted, everything is running smoother than before even with some heavily modded games. HOWEVER because I was back in the GTX 900 series I fell that anyone else at this level or lower should make the Jump to the RTX 2080. Simply because I don't try to keep up with the newest and coolest thing that just came out. when I make the purchase for a component such as this i try to keep it for as long as i possibly can. if you are currently in the GTX 1000 series spending the money honestly right now doesn't seem to be justified just yet. I say this because this time around we are not seeing crazy outstanding performance increase from the 1080's to the 2080's. Unless you have the cash burning a hole in your pocket, you may want to wait till something new is released or Ray Tracing becomes more of a thing (i'm betting on it but i could be wrong).

3) Investing: This plays a little bit off the last part, Ray Tracing. I honestly believe this is going to be brought into play sooner than others may expect (although I could be wrong). until recently Nvidia only had what they developed and to showcased last year what the possibility of what Ray tracing could do. however just recently using Unreal engine a stunning short video with ray tracing inside of it came out. diving deeper into it i found they added the support for Dx12 ray tracing, and will be releasing this for development soon. With them moving forward with it i felt it was the right investment for me to get a 2080 rather than a cheaper 1080.

In conclusion, This is a great card. the price may be high but I plan to keep my card for the next 4-5 years at the least. if you are currently rocking a GTX 1000 series, honestly hold off till the end of the year or maybe the first quarter of 2020, because your card should be fine until something better with ray tracing actually comes out. (just because its released soon doesn't mean it we'll have a new game overnight) and hopefully further in the year the price will drop for the 2080's."^5^Apr 1, 2019 2:34 PM

However, in all honesty it performs exactly like a gtx 1080ti, with the wonderful addition of the rtx. If youre on the fence about getting this and you have a 1080ti please dont upgrade, you wont notice a difference in fps, itll be there, but so minuscule that youll hate yourself for upgrading. Its really more of a sidegrade with added benefit of rtx. Now if youre moving to a 2080ti, then you will absolutely feel the difference. Back to this specific gpu, its one of the better 2080s by a long shot. If youre worried about sagging definitely pick up a support bracket bc it sags just a bit. In short, great card, very nice thermals and very quiet. And as always, cant beat that evga service."^5^Mar 1, 2019 11:30 AM

The issues I have are 1) fans are noisy at times, almost like their bearings aren't completely round, and it seems like maybe it is hitting the plastic bezel around them. Also, I run dual monitors, and since upgrading this card, I have had constant issues with the second monitor going to sleep, and then not being able to wake it.

This card is massive. Perhaps one of the largest 2080's you can buy. It is a non reference PCB (thats a good thing imo) and requires 2x 8 pin connections rather than the standard 1x 6pin and 1x 8pin connections. The back plate is nice and solid, and has thermal pads under it to help with cooling. The card comes with a support bracket which I would recommend installing given the size and weight of this monster. Heatsink is massive. 3 Fans help keep it all cool. The 2 large fans spin up together at the same RPM, the smaller fan spins up if the card gets a little hotter at a separate RPM. Hardware applications will report just 2 fan speeds, and from what I have been able to tell, the 2 big fans are reported together. In addition to the card you get the support bracket, and a 6pin to 8pin adapter. Initial presentation is very good. It feels tightly put together, solid, heavy, quality, very sturdy.

OVERCLOCKABILITY:
Short answer: 2070mhz core, +1000mhz memory. You will max out the memory slider in MSI Afterburner. I think the memory would actually go higher if the slider went higher, but at +1000 youre maxed out in the software - truly impressive memory overclock. Many people are running around +700 or +800 on memory overclocks from what Ive seen on the 2080's. Also just for reference my particular card came with Samsung memory modules, as per GPU Z. The core clock honestly ends up being limited by the power limit. 109% is the highest power limit you can run on this card as of right now. This gives you enough headroom to run most games at around the 2070mhz mark, which is still a great overclock. The card ran at 1995mhz under full load right out of the box before I even touched it. I ranOC Scanner then adjusted the curve manually so that at the higher voltage draws (load) I would top at 2100mhz. Due to the afformentioned power limit however, you rarely see 2100mhz as it gets throttled. Still, at 2070mhz core and 8,000mhz memory speed, I am seeing a nice bump in performance over a stock 2080, and closing the gap a little on a stock 2080ti. I consider the card a great overclocker that is actually limited right now by its own bios and software. At these speeds and under full load I never saw anything above 68 degrees C, and in many games I sit around 62C...Really impressive. This card has the best you will find in air cooling. The RGB lighting and Mystic Light V3 software are a nice addition. There are lots of different lighting presets you can play with in the software - probably a good 15 options or so of various effects and animations then you can customize your own colors if you'd like.

PERFORMANCE:
Performance is about what you would expect if youve seen other reviews or benchmarks of the 20 series. Im around 10,500 in 3d mark timespy benchmark (defaults) with an i7 7700k at 4.8ghz and ddr4 3000 memory. The card drives most all the games I play currently to my personal magic number, which is 120fps. Im running an ultrawide 3440x1440 monitor that has a refresh rate of 120hz. The whole purpose of getting this card, and upgrading from my 1080, was to push 120fps to the monitor to take full advantage of the panel refresh rate. Where my 1080 powered many games (like BF5) at around 90 or 95 fps, with this card I am hitting that 120fps mark. Call of Duty Black ops 4 easily tops 120fps at ultra graphics, 3440x1440 resolution, only occasionally dropping below my 120 cap just a few frames. This is all I wanted it to do - push high/ultra settings at 120fps, and it does it in most games. The nice overclock I get form the card as mentioned in the previous section also helps a lot. I hope in a future bios release they up the 109% power limit on the card, because I think you could push this core right on up to, and above, 2100mhz. The thermal headroom is there thanks to the great cooling solution on the card, and the larger, non reference PCB and backplate. There is more surface area to spread the heat, and the heatsink and fans are both bigger than many of the competitor cards.

STABILITY / RELIABILITY
With all the news of 20 series failures, this was the one thing that really occupied my mind when I bought this card. There has been a lot of talk online about potential problems with the 20 series and failure rates - particularly the 2080ti, and even more particularly the founders edition cards. Nonetheless, my first priority was to hammer this card as hard as possible after purchase with heavy, prolonged loads. Ive looped intense benchmarks like furmark, 3d mark, heaven, and others for hours on end, some even ran all night long while I slept, and I have not had the card crash or fail a single time thus far. Im over 2 weeks into ownership now but have logged dozens of hours of actual full load processing on the card. My theory is that if it is a dud, or if it is going to fail, I want it to fail right now so that I can take it back. I have a 45 day return window with bestbuy so If it is a dud I want to know it asap, and that is why I have hammered the card so hard in testing. Thus far however I have been unable to make it crash. The only issue I have noted since upgrading from my 1080 is occasionally I get some weird flickering on one of my 2 screens (I run a double monitor set up). This flickering will occur just sitting at desktop sometimes, or just browsing the internet, or watching a video or stream. I have determined however that this issue appears to be driver related, and is related to GSYNC. If I disable, and re-enable GSYNC in the video drivers then the flickering goes away completely. I've not been able to determine what the onset is however. It seems to just randomly start happening sometimes, and its somewhat rare. In 2 weeks for example Ive had it happen maybe 6 times, and every time I've just been at desktop or browsing online, very light load on the video card. Toggling gsync off and back on has always fixed it, so feel strongly that this is a driver issue that will get fixed. I did flash to the latest BIOS for the card and it had no impact on the issue, it has occurred a few times since the flash. If I felt for a second that this was a hardware level defect then I would return the card immediately, but I'm convinced it is driver related, otherwise toggling gsync wouldn't fix it. Ive never had the issue show up while in a game or benchmark loop however, which is where you would logically expect a hardware problem to really show up. Temperatures even under multi hour benchmark loops never went above 68c. Often sat in mid 60's under full load.

FINAL WORD:
If youre in the market for a 2080, and you want a good, solid 2080, then I can recommend the MSI Gaming X Trio enough. I feel perosnally that this is THE best 2080 you can buy. I say that because it has what I think is the largest heatsink on the market, and some of the largest fans, coupled with a solid metal backplate. Not only does it have potentially the biggest cooling solution, but it is also on perhaps the largest PCB. This isnt a reference PCB, it is a custom built PCB from MSI and is larger, meaning it has a larger footprint for heat spread, including on the backplate which coves the entire back. I also like that the card runs on 2x 8pin connections. Most every other 2080 you look at will run on 1x 8pin and 1x 6pin, so this board has access to more power. So you got the best air cooler, more power headroom, and a non reference PCB, with stellar overclocking results. I dont know of a better 2080. Maybe you could point to the 109% power limit cap...that's the only negative that I could potentially see. However, my testing has shown that even with 109% power cap I am still sitting clos to where most people are topping out their 2080 core clocks. You eventually just run out of voltage room on these cards given the vcore is locked by nvidia, and thats true for all cards.

PROS:
+Large, Custom PCB. Not a reference design
+2x 8pin rather than 1x 6pin and 1x 8pin.
+Largest heatsink and cooling solution to my knowledge on the market for a 2080. Temps sit mid 60's under full load and full overclock.
+Nice RGB lighting and backplate design. The card looks sharp.
+Comes with support bracket, cause this thing is a beast.

If you are someone who is in the market for a Nvidia RTX graphic card you probably have done your research and you know the pros and cons of the new RTX product line. Nvidia RTX brings completely new technology to PC gaming and the like it or not all PC gamer are better severed because of it. New hardware features are a gamble that can take years to make its way to the software that our PC gaming is built on. There are PC game titles that do support some of the new features of the RTX graphic cards but support is not guaranteed and, in most cases, you should never buy technologies on promises of what it might do. It is usually wiser to buy technology that fits your needs for what you do today because in computers changes is always happening. Standards and feature found in RTX graphic cards can take years to be accepted or fade away. I applaud Nvidia for its support of PC gaming. I wish the price was lower but again when you buy at this level you should have done your research. Now what about the MSI RTX 2080 Gaming X card, well its a beauty and beast. I had a GTX 1080ti and was very happy with its performance. But I was due for a major upgrade of my gaming PC and I had another place to keep the 1080ti in service so I decided to roll the dice for the MSI card. I am not going to say I am breaking new benchmarks with the RTX 2080 but I am not giving up any performance to the 1080ti either. For me this was a personnel choice to use for another three years to the next upgrade. The MSI RTX 2080 is quiet, fast and looks great in my tempered glass case. I spent many days on this upgrade and I wanted a complete refresh and I certainly got it. Buy the MSI RTX Gaming X because it is in the top 3 or 4 PC gaming cards available today. Yes, there are finally good options for PC Gamers again and that is great news, but our hobby needs cards like this because it keeps moving the bar up and in time all PC Gamers will benefit."^5^Jan 3, 2019 9:58 PM

This thing beasts through games. Paired with my 144hz Quad-HD 1440p 27' Acer Predator I produce atleast 100+ FPS in most games in ULTRA settings. Very optimal for what I need. I could probably get a few extra FPS from an intel cpu as I'm running a Ryzen 1800x @ 4.0ghz.

- included accessories are sparse, just a support bracket with a cheesy catch phrase screen printed on and a PCIe cable converter dongle
- some PCB level components omitted on this card that other competing vendors include on theirs. Would really add value if those were implemented (check out YouTube for video breakdowns of this card to see what I mean here).

Overall this is a great GPU that offers good performance. Coming from a GTX 1080, having this card is a night-and-day difference. This card is a definite buy on sale or if you just can't wait to upgrade."^4^Dec 15, 2018 3:39 PM

The first FE wouldn't play half my games at all, which may have been a driver issue but I doubt it - returned. The Second FE I realized failed when my computer wouldn't boot - and it was powering my MB w/o cpu being on - returned. Finally I buy this, more expensive but the best option. I installed it and a week later I find a screw just chilling in the ES bag, I uninstall card and find it missing from the back plate and 3 more screws loose... I fixed that. Otherwise no problems and I would still recommend it over the 2080 FE IMO given my experience. Bad enclosed design for cooling. Buy a GPU brace or two, or both kinds as this is the largest card ever, but it hardly ever spins the fans except for games. Very quiet considering. The 'Geforce' does not light up as bright as the 'MSI' RGB lighting but this is normal - I saw it in a review as well. This card is huge and heavy and it does sag w/o proper bracing - buy that as well. Pretty Card with the RGB lighting but I have an Asus MB so they don't sync. Also, I was fortunate to have bought this during the holiday extended return policy, I would have been stuck with a broke 2080 FE otherwise as it failed after 1 month of use.

An 8 gig, fairly fast GPU that was currently selling for more than half what id spent on the entire rig.

This brings us to today, there was a flash sale on some select GPU's 'thank you bestbuy!' so even though I didn't need it in the least.... I was intrigued by the price, so I bought it to put in my kids gaming PC. I won't say what I paid for it... but lets just say I paid what it should've been selling for!

I now find myself wanting to use my kids PC as much as my AlienWare R7! I've always liked the AMD stuff, not only because u get more bang for your buck... But I also like the interface much more, I find it easier to use, and it's the only brand that I know how to Overclock a GPU.

After using for several days, running games like Mass Affect Andromeda, Doom, Wolfenstein 2, Black Ops 3, and many other triple A releases.... It's holding neck and neck with the 1070 GTX!! Which I was NOT expecting.

Also BTW this card is Physically Huge! I would take measurements of your space and compare them with the specs. They had a giant tower, with plenty of space, but this card just barely had room to fit. Its a freaking foot long!!

Also really like having 2 HDMI's right off the bat, I wish more cards offered that

If it's on any kind of sale where it's in the lower 300 area, you really can't go wrong with this one. It's got some POWER. Overclocking with the Global Wattman is also very simple. many you tube videos to refer to on that for step by step"^5^May 9, 2018 3:13 PM

Deskandchiars^/lg-8x-external-usb-2-0-double-layer-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-silver/7979483?variant=A&sort=MOST_HELPFUL^4^2^"The instructions state, in pertinent part [after connecting the USB cable to your computer]
'WHEN the computer is ready, confirm that the drive is detected. And, THEN, insert the supplied software CD into the drive and install the software.' (emphasis added).
Error 1. At least on an iMac, the computer does not show the drive has been detected UNTIL a CD is inserted in the drive. Hence, the first condition in the instructions above can not be met and further would seem to indicate a problem has occurred.
Error 2. After returning to Best Buy to consult about error #1, I was told that one need not insert the software CD at all, as long as the computer is connected to the internet. This is not mentioned in the instructions.
To test this advice, I inserted a music CD in the drive. I never inserted the software CD at all. Upon inserting the music CD, the drive was recognized and displayed on the computer screen, and I uploaded the music successfully.
So, the experience with this drive is much different than other devices I use, such as an external hard drive or thumb drives in that connecting the device to the USB port is not sufficient for the computer to register that it has detected the LG portable drive.
I hope it works better than the instructions. Can't comment on that as I only had it for a day. As others have stated, I only purchased this because the iMac no long comes with a CD drive integral to the computer, but CDs are not (yet) obsolete. I hope I can install my turbotax CD..
