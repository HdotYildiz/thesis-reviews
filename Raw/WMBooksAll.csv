XcelShopper, ^1161265^5^0^"My 3rd grader loved this series when she started reading chapter books so I decided to buy it for my niece. The kids get hooked on the stories because its well written & easy to follow. I just wish walmart.com offered the later series in box sets too."^5^January 7, 2009
katy2014, ^1161265^3^0^"I bought for my classroom. Loved these stories. Each book takes you on a journey to different and exciting places. They offer experiences that you seldom experience in real life.

These are very well developed stories. Most. If not all of the books are Accelerated Reader , AR rated. Range from 2.0 to 6.0.

Reading to, and with,or listening to your child reading 30 minutes a day will help your child to advance in the classroom more quickly than any other thing that you do for them. Begin 2nd grade abt 30 min. A day.

Start at 1 yr old for 10 min. LET THEM choose from books that you have selected.. Ask them to tell you what happened in the book in their own words after reading. Or what happened first,second , next and last, for older kids."^5^December 1, 2014

Crystal, ^45761465^46^4^"My fault for not reading the dimensions before purchasing. And although they are very nice. I love the 'leather'covers and the colors. They would be great for display if they were regular sized. However these books are tiny. Similar to the size of a child's bible. I can not comfortably read it. If you are looking for average sized books these are not for you."^3^May 17, 2016

CalebsMom99, ^378996^140^10^"We all know this is a great book to buy for a graduation present. Let me share a little tip with you, though. Buy this book for your child and take it to the teachers they've had. Let each teacher write a note in it for them. My son is in 3rd grade and my twin daughters are in 1st grade. I purchased three copies of this book and will be having every teacher sign it at the end of the year. I will give it to each child at their graduation party. Can you imagine receiving such a gift? I loved this idea so much that I had to share it. What a blessing to our children and what a way to build up their self worth as they prepare for college!"^5^June 8, 2008

Shari, ^378996^12^5^"Love Dr. Seuss and so do my grandkids.  Bought this book for a specific reason.  Saw online how a dad purchased this book years ago and had his daughters teachers write something in it from pre-school through her Senior years.  He gave it to her when she graduated.  I wanted to do the same thing with my granddaughter."^5^February 12, 2017
FrugalAndSavvyShopper, ^378996^11^2^"I bought this book for two reasons. One, I loved it as a child. Two, I saw an idea on Pinterest. The idea is each school year to have your child's teacher write them something about your child on a page until they graduate high school, then give it to them as a graduation gift."^5^March 18, 2014
KatP, ^378996^10^2^"This book was perfect!
Hardcover was in perfect condition. 
Barnes and Noble was selling it for 20 dollars Target was selling it for 15 and its the exact same book!"^5^May 31, 2016
^378996^6^5^"The first time I read this book was in college. One of my professors read it on the first day of class and emphasized that we can all do great things in life so long as we have the drive.
I looked for this book online and found that a lot of the used books have descriptions that read 'writing on the first page', 'inscription on first page', etc...this seemed to me to be a testament of this book that people enjoy it so much and find it worthwhile enough to gift it over and over again throughout the years.
I am purchasing this book for my little sister for her high school graduation and I hope that she will enjoy it as much as I have.
This is one of the most meaningful and wonderful Dr. Seuss books I have ever read! Highly recommended for children through adults!"^5^May 14, 2008
ILUVEP, ^378996^5^2^"I went to graduation parties where they had this book and had people sign well wishes to the graduate.

Heather, ^378996^1^1^"I love this book, and planned to buy one for each of my kids so their teachers could sign it. However, when I ordered them it limits you to 3 per order, and I have 4 kids. Plus when I bought all 3 with another item I earned free shipping; so now I need to either stop at a store and hope they have it or pay for shipping on one book."^3^December 8, 2015
mamaowl2012, ^378996^1^2^"Although I love this book, this listing says it's for the 'Party Edition' but when I ordered it it was no different than the regular edition. The party edition is supposed to have a more decorative cover and the one I recieved was plain. I double checked the ISBN on this listing and the plain version listing and they are the exact same."^2^May 5, 2012
SherryAnne, ^43378712^16^0^"It is so-o-o worth it. I have not put the 1st book down since I got it. After I saw the first season on Starz And ordered the dvd through walmart.com. I had to read the books to see how the author developed the characters. Book to screen is always different. It is just not possible to show your personal experience with a book on screen. Both versions are fantastic! I have not read a book in over 40 years."^5^July 7, 2015
trubiemom, ^43378712^3^2^"I love the way these books are written and the stories that they hold. Once you begin reading, you become completely engrossed in the period and in the character lives and you just have to continue to the next book to see how their story unveils."^5^May 9, 2016

Disappointed, ^47047942^3^1^"I was so excited to get this in the mail. When I flipped through the book though I was very disappointed. There are a few very intricate detailed pages but most of them look like a coloring book from the dollar store."^2^November 22, 2015
NCGal83, ^47047942^2^2^"I received this book as a gift. I had seen the book at Wal-Mart but didn't buy it. I was surprised when my mom showed up with this book. I am a HUGE HP fan so I was really excited to receive this. I am not a fan of the adult coloring books but figured that since it was Harry Potter that I would love it. Well I was wrong. There are some good pages, but there are one with so many details that it would take to long to color and I would lose interest. I just think that this book was not as great as I expected and I was disappointed."^3^February 19, 2016

I've spent a lot of money and time purchasing work books for my three kids and they can't even touch everything that's in these books. 320 pages of everything they are ACTUALLY learning in school. It's really got everything you'll need to get your kids through school and on a level they can understand. I'd purchase this book before even looking another one's direction."^5^March 11, 2010

NachoMan, ^734355006^36^0^"Powerful, powerful book. I haven't come across a better book for a young or older mom to read. My wife handed me this book to read after reading it herself (and wiping away her tears). As you read this story, you quickly see where it's going, but that doesn't diminish the impact of the final pages. As much as I tried to remain stoic and composed (my wife was right there watching!), my face flushed, a lump formed in my stomach and throat, my eyes welled up with tears and (by the end) a few tears dripped off my nose. Perhaps I'm a softy, but this book really has an impact. As much as I love my two sons and can't imagine anyone loving them more, this book opened my eyes to how special and unique the love between mother and son is."^5^January 11, 2010
Babystonecold, ^734355006^28^3^"I read this book to my son when he was a baby at least once a week. I read to him every night and he had a lot of books for me to choose from, but I kept going back to this one. As he got older, he started singing the little verse with me, only saying 'my mommy you'll be'. I thought it was so sweet! He's 12 yrs old now and from time to time (mainly when he's sick or has a lot on his mind), I'll get this book out and read it to him. That may sound corny, but it kind of fits the book! We will love this book forever!!!
I have also bought this book for several moms-to-be as part of their shower gift."^5^August 7, 2011
JeremiahAndHeather, ^734355006^19^0^"i remember this book from when i was little, so i wanted to find it for my son. walmart was the cheapest place, too.

it's a great story, and it still brings tears to my eyes every time i read it."^5^September 20, 2009
Raleighmomof1, ^734355006^9^3^"I ordered this book for my son's 1st birthday. I've read it to him a few times, but he doesn't quite have the attention span for this 28 page book. I look forward to reading it to him when he is a little older. I really like the story--demonstrates how a Mother will always love her baby no matter how old he gets. My husband, on the other hand does not like the book. My husband called the mom in the book a 'stalker mom'--when the son is grown and moved away, his mother drives across town, opens the window, and holds her son (rocking and singing to him). I gave only 4 stars since my husband dislikes the book. I'm keeping this book because I like that it portrays a deep & special bond between a mom and her son. I'm sure my son will like it when he is older."^4^October 1, 2011
yoopergirl49781, ^734355006^8^0^"This is the second book I bought. The first one was for my son and it is wonderful! So I bought it again for my new nephew. I recommend this if you have a son, nephew or a friend is having a little boy."^5^February 22, 2014
b1mom, ^734355006^8^2^"This is one of the cutest, most heartwarming books I have ever read. I bought it for my son (age 33 :) because the picture on the front looks exactly like a memory we had when he was almost 2 years old. My son, 'then,' escaped my watch for a few minutes when he made believe that he was going to potty. Little did I know that he was in some mischief with the toilet paper & an entire tube of toothpaste!( a HUGE tube!) When I went to check on the 'potty status,' I opened the bathroom door expecting to, of course, see him sitting calmly on the potty chair. Then suddenly I gasped at the sight before my eyes! My usually 'trouble-free' little boy was covered in toothpaste, the toilet paper roll was UNrolled all over the bathroom. There was toothpaste & toilet paper on the toilet seat, the sink, the floor, the door, the mirror & all over the shower floor! Needless to say, I'm sure that my son expected to get in trouble for this, but all I could do was laugh!

So, now you see why I just HAD to buy this book. Like I said, I got it for my son. (actually for Mother's Day gift-because I wouldn't be a Mom if I didn't have him as a son!) But I had to read it before I sent it to him. This book is absolutely priceless with the message it sends to children ( & adults,) about the love of a mother. And what an ending! You just have to get this book! The only thing I would change is . . .the age level! I think it should read 'for ages 3 to 103!"^5^May 18, 2010
WONDERFULPRESENT, ^734355006^4^0^"I first brought this book over 20 yrs ago for my youngest child. I loved it so much, that I have brought a copy for each of my 7 grandchildren. I am now purchasing this copy for my soon to be great grandchild!!!!

The kids even get my husband to sing, which is AMAZING! It touches all of us. WE LOVE THIS STORY!

SweetViolin, ^734355006^1^0^"This is the story of a mother who takes care of her little boy from diapers to the teenage years and all the way through adulthood. As the mother ages and becomes more dependent, it tells the story of how the son gives back and takes care of his mother in her old age. It's very touching; a great 'circle of life' story and one that illustrates the love between a parent and child. This book is great for girls too but because it's the story of the special relationship between mothers and sons, I love giving this book to new mothers of baby boys or mothers of toddler boys. It makes me tear-up every time. When my kids were little, it was always the story they wanted me to read. I made up a little tune to go with the song so you can make it unique to your family. I just bought 5 copies to have on hand for gifts."^5^November 26, 2012

When I read that book it caught my attention and made me realize that everyday we are in a constant battle not only physically but spiritually and emotionally in our minds as well. I have read The Penny, The Battlefield of The Mind, and Living Beyond Your Feelings which I am currently reading and it's pretty good. Even though I haven't read all of her books she is w/out a doubt one of the few pastors that I will actually look up to. Tell your friends and your family to get her books. You can learn a lot from her. I have and one thing that I've also learned is that life is a never-ending school. You start from Preschool, Elementary, middle/Jr. High, High School, and College and even though u graduated from those schools you are still learning a lot about life and yourself."^4^March 11, 2012

nrann, ^16658937^1^2^"The book Wonder is a touching story from the author R.J. Palacio.  Wonder is a major motion picture that is about a boy with facial deformities and the struggles he faces.  I thought that it was a great book showing that you should never judge somebody by how they look.
	In the book, August Pullman, Jack Will, Summer and Julian are  the main characters. Their school, Beecher Prep, is the main setting for the story.  The main conflict is among the characters who want to be August’s friend and those who always want to make fun of him.  The conflict is finally resolved when the fifth grade class goes to an overnight camp.  At the camp August and Jack are being bullied.  Classmates join together to help fight the bullies.  At this point all of the other students realize that Auggie is a normal boy and want to be his friend.
	The protagonist is Jack Will.  In the beginning of the book he is August’s friend because the principal firsts introduces the two boys and asks Jack to be friends with August.  Then on Halloween, August walks into class to overhear Jack talking badly about August with some other boys.  This upsets August and he doesn’t want Jack to be his friend.  Once Jack realizes why Auggie is mad at him he apologizes and they become friends again.  Jack is an important character because he is the one friend who is always there for Auggie.  
	I really enjoyed this book because of its message and how it makes everyone aware that we shouldn’t judge people by their looks.  I didn’t enjoy reading the part when the kids were making fun of Auggie and acting like he had a disease.  I felt sorry for him during this part.  This book is unique because it sends a heartfelt message to kids about being kind to others.  The author could have written more about what August did after school ended.  I was enjoying the book and didn’t want it to end.  I would definitely recommend this story to others because of the awesome message it conveys about being kind to others.  Everyone should read this book!"^5^January 26, 2018

I ordered two books, and even though the books are great, I received two different versions. 2008 and 2012 versions are quite different, with several sections the same, but in a different order. Some sections are entirely different, and my daughters are twins, and would have liked the same book. But this doesn't take away from the book at all. They (the children) are still quite happy with their books. The versions look the same from the outside, but when opened they are different.

AbeRTMS, ^5738953^1^0^"I genuinely really loved this book to the point where I can’t stop re-reading it. The book is basically all about this girl named Matilda who is the most spectacular child you can come across in you entire life. Sadly, this prodigy of a child is not recognized by her very obnoxious parents. They actually do not encourage her to read books, instead they want her to waste her time watching TV. There are many things I love about this book, now I don’t know about you but I find the character Matilda very inspiring even though she is fictional. But there is something that maybe some people may not enjoy which is the fact that the book takes a long time to read. In my opinion anyone over the age of nine can read this book. This has been and always will be one of the top 5 books I’ve ever read."^5^April 27, 2014

I decided to try other materials. One of my friends was using this book with her boy. So I think, hey, it's only 12 bucks (it was on sale when I bought it at Walmart.com), I will give it a try. We are 15 days into the program and I have to say IT WORKS! My girl now loves to do reading lessons. She's confident in sounding out words and is looking forward to the next lesson everyday.

dreamindar, ^390907^15^0^"Ok, my almost 5 year old is up to lesson #23 and is reading sentances like...'this is a rock. sam is at the rock.' Pretty impressive to me so far. We have had a few 'whiny' lessons, especially when a new skill or concept is introduced but he quickly overcomes them (usually by the next lesson). I will warn you, when you first get the book the concepts are different. Different from your typical 'a says aah' kind of stuff so don't be shocked when you get it. But, even though different, my little one is starting to read! Just work the program. Follow the directions for repitition and correction.

gborgh, ^390907^13^1^"This book exceeds my expectations. I cannot comment on my child's reading success at the moment because we have only been using this for a few days. However, this is sort of a How to Teach Reading for Dummies book in my opinion. I don't have to review the lessons, just read exactly what it says for me to say in the highlighted parts on the page. Super easy. This makes teaching easy and stress-free. My daughter enjoys the lessons and she can stay focused because they are only about 15 minutes long, once per day. If you are looking for a book to help you teach your child to read, this is it. All you need is 15 minutes of lesson time each day."^5^October 10, 2011

Shayde13, ^390907^11^0^"Over the past 25 years we have been teaching our kids to read using this book.

The eldest learned quickly in K before we moved. First grade, and a poor teacher/district set her back to not being able to read. We concluded it was our fault for allowing others to control our children's education. We decided to homeschool.

When we founds this reading book, it was almost instantly helpful. She took to it rapidly sometimes taking 2-3 lessons a day. By the end of that summer after 1st grade she had regained all her lost reading skills and was now easily surpassing children in the neighborhood in 2nd, 3rd and even 4th grade.

Fast forward 20 years and we are still using the same, ragged book, and it is still effective. Four other children have learned to read using it. Each retained and grew in reading skills well beyond equivalent public school peer grade level all their childhood and even the 12year old reads above college grad level.

We are now using this same book to teach our two youngest children. The 7 year old reads better than public school kids 2 years older than he is and the 5 year old is becoming very impressed with his ability to read words where he once just saw random letters. Every day is a new discovery for him and his brother now just sits and reads actual books, without pictures, as often as he reads those with.

To those advocating that this is not 'advanced' and suggesting other programs for older children. I say they are wrong. Each child will be ready to read and to learn to read at a different time. But, think about it, if the child has trouble reading 'advanced' is NOT what you want to throw at him or her.

This set of lessons teaches the child to use one of the greatest advantages the human brain has, pattern recognition. The child learns to recognize distinct patterns in the highly variable English language. It uses a slightly modified written symbolic representation of those sound patterns to make them easier to recognize and learn. It then moves the child, once the patterns are learned through a logically simplified process of normalizing those new pattern recognition skills so that they can then read unmodified text with the same confidence and accuracy as they could the symbolic text.

It's a really ingenious method that has worked for and continues to work for all seven of our children, each with distinctly differing personalities and learning types.

The older (now adult) children are already fighting over who gets the book for their kids. We plan to buy a copy of this same book for each of them."^5^December 9, 2015
Yochana, ^390907^10^2^"A friend recommended “Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons”, when we received the book and started it, it was hard to imagine how something so easy was going to have our daughter reading at the end of 100 days.

Oweena, ^390907^5^1^"If you are looking for something simple to use with your child who is interested in learning to read... this is it. The lessons are short to keep a young one's attention, use visual tricks to teach different concepts (ex: make the letter smaller than surrounding ones when it is silent in the word), have lots of review from lesson to lesson, and progress quick enough where the child is learning to read simple words and sentences quickly."^5^March 8, 2011

jessibelle32, ^390907^4^0^"This book has been amazing for my two oldest children. It fascinates me to see how they begin with such basic, almost boring steps, then progress to being able to read so swiftly. They feel a great sense of accomplishment in a very short amount of time. I am on lesson 20 with my third child and bought this as a gift for my sister for her children. Don't let the first few lessons discourage you, and stick to the dialogue in the book. It's well-worth it! They start reading 'stories' after about 10 or 15 lessons, and it gets more and more rewarding as they progress. The printed dialogue makes that parent/teacher's job easy and keeps you from getting frustrated--just stick to the text and you're good!"^5^July 12, 2011
Bugof6, ^390907^4^0^"I've used this book to teach four of our children to read. It is excellent! Each one of them was reading at a 2nd grade level when finished with the book. The only complaint I've heard from others who use it as well is that the lessons can be somewhat redundant and the child, of course, doesn't like repetition. In my opinion, however, repetition is key. It also takes longer than 20min/day as you progress further into the book. Another drawback, I found myself, was the writing at the end of each lesson. However, I just had my child skip that task. :) Also, there are several typographical errors throughout the book, but nothing that hinders teaching. My kids loved uncovering the pictures (you cover them up) with each story...it was great anticipation and made it fun."^5^November 13, 2007

HomeskoolGram, ^390907^1^1^"I used this 'teacher-friendly' book for the last four of my six children. Now using it with grandchildren. Because dyslexia runs in our family, the multisensory (seeing, hearing, and writing), phonetical approach to reading helped introduce the sound foundation they needed. Each of the 100 lessons takes around 20 min., so in one summer, your pre-schooler or kindergartener will be reading phonetically with confidence (not by guessing, using 'sight words'). I help other families' kids learn to read, and have given my copy away several times, so keep buying a new copy for home!

Bassocantor, ^51334262^4^0^"Much of the writing in THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING is tongue-in-cheek. Surprisingly, however, there is a lot in this book that is SERIOUS. I know, I know, with a title like that, it's hard to believe, but it's true. Mark Manson actually makes quite a few substantive, helpful points.

Mark makes it clear that he's NOT saying you should not care about anything. Not at all. What he is saying is that you should pick carefully WHICH things you care about:

    'This book will help you think a little bit more clearly about what you’re choosing to find important in life and what you’re choosing to find unimportant.'

He's not suggesting we should be indifferent; rather, carefully deciding where to place our concern.

How you pick your top concerns has practical consequences. Mark gives a real-world example about a cranky person in the check-out line at the market. The elderly customer is making a big fuss about some minor thing. Why? Because they don't have anything else to occupy their time. If you don't have anything substantive to occupy your time, then it's trivial stuff that bothers you:

    'Your ex-boyfriend’s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer—chances are you don’t have much going on in your life...'

Mark suggests just picking a few big things--values and people that reflect your values: 'What I’m talking about here is essentially learning how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively—how to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you based on finely honed personal values.'

Much of life is about solving problems. They are inevitable, and we shouldn't pretend that we can make them go away. The author has no kind words for those embracing victimhood:

    'People deny and blame others for their problems for the simple reason that it’s easy and feels good, while solving problems is hard and often feels bad.'

On a serious note, the author relates a horrific experience from his youth, when a drunken friend took a dare, jumped into a lake and drowned.

    'The most transformational moment of my life occurred when I was nineteen years old.' This tragedy led to a determination to change the direction of his life, and figure out what is most important: 'Oddly, it was someone else’s death that gave me permission to finally live. And perhaps the worst moment of my life was also the most transformational.'

The last part of the book has a serious tone--quite different in tone than the first part of the book. This part of the book is more philosophical. The author refers often to a book, 'The Denial of Death,' (which became a Pulitzer Prize winner.) In serious, heartfelt chapters, the author reflects on human existence, and our search for meaning in life.

All in all, I found THE SUBTLE ART to be a fascinating read. The author writes well, and the book is easy to follow. Don't be fooled by the title; a lot of this book is very serious."^4^March 11, 2018

PTNDSLR, ^392592^18^1^"I won't waste your time with a rundown of what 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' is about. With over 15 million copies sold, and with a very self-explanatory title, I think you all get it. For the rare person who may not know what this book is about, here's a succinct description: in 1930s vernacular prose, Dale Carnegie explains that by appealing to the other person's highest ideals, remembering the other person's name, letting the other person do most of the talking, speaking in terms of the other person's interests, allowing the other to save face, by 'throwing down a challenge,' etc., you can make a friend out of just about anyone.

The advice is largely sound, but I think the reader should keep in mind the context within which this book was written. 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' was written in the 1930's and intended primarily as a companion book to Dale Carnegie's classes on how to be a good salesman. In other words, these techniques work very well in the context of sales and public relations, i.e., in relationships that are not expected to be deep and/or long-lasting. I wouldn't recommend using these techniques on close personal friends. Doing so may make a person come across as a bit 'plastic.'

Also, there is one major point that I think needs to be remembered, but unfortunately is nowhere to be found in 'How to Win Friends and Influence People.' During my research of Dale Carnegie's techniques, I came across what I believe may be the only biography available about him: Dale Carnegie: The Man Who Influenced Millions by Giles Kemp and Edward Claflin. This book reveals many interesting things, such as the fact that Dale Carnegie grew up poor; he lost part of his left index finger when he was a child; he often broke many of the tenets set forth in this book, often forgetting others' names, often arguing with others, etc. But what I found most interesting was that the last chapter of 'How to Win Friends' was to describe those individuals with whom none of Dale Carnegie's techniques work. In this unpublished chapter, Carnegie wrote that there were some people with whom it was impossible to get along. You either needed to divorce such people, 'knock them down,' or sue them in court.

Why is that chapter absent from this book, you ask? Well, Dale Carnegie was in the middle of writing this chapter when he was offered a trip to Europe, and rather than complete this last chapter he decided to take the trip. The uncompleted book was sent off to publishers, and Carnegie shipped off to Europe.

Giles Kemp and Edward Claflin say that given the optimistic tone of the rest of 'How to Win Friends,' the European trip was perhaps the better choice. Reconciling the the unwritten chapter with the rest of this optimistic book would've been nearly impossible, they say.

Anyway, I think that this unpublished chapter is important to keep in mind. I had to learn the hard way that the unpublished chapter is very true. There are some people with whom it is impossible to get along. When you meet up with such people, and believe me you will, don't think that you've failed the Carnegie techniques. Instead, remind yourself that you are experiencing exactly what Carnegie describes in that pragmatic, unpublished chapter. And then quickly move on to the nicer people!"^5^September 11, 2010
torridtemptations, ^392592^8^0^"Since reading this book, I feel like for the first time I have been given the basic instructions to approach obstacles in a positive way with a degree of confidence in a positive outcome. We have a child with Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and we have been in therapy for 8 years with multiple counselors and psychologists with little to no improvement. She is frequently against anything and everything that we try to teach her or help her with and has no reaction to any type of discipline. In her mind she is always right, always has all the answers and when something goes wrong she is always the faultless victim. I have frequently felt completely hopeless and overwhelmed, and I have thrown up my hands and said that I have run out of ideas and answers about what we could do to help her. Now that I have read this book I have had floods of ideas in how I could approach day-to-day issues without getting as upset or trying to correct her behavior, and I have found many faults in my previous methods which obviously were not working. I have just finished this book so I can't say that we have worked any miracles but I began applying these simple principles while still reading the book and we are already experiencing more pleasant behaviors and finding more enjoyment in our time together. I have already recommended this book to several friends and family members and I'm hoping that they read it and can benefit from it as I feel I have!"^5^May 14, 2012

motivatror90, ^392592^1^0^"A classic (originally published in the 30's) and a must-have, this timeless piece of work can help just about anybody get along better with others and win them over to their way of thinking. Don't have a lot of time to spare? Don't worry. The book is divided into short sections, each one devoted to a particular principle that is well illustrated with many practical examples. In this way, you can read a chapter quickly, stop and do other things you have to do if necessary, and get back to the book when you have time- all without losing continuity.

Thoroughly entertaining by using fun and interesting examples, I don't think many readers will regret checking this one out and I like to think of this book as a kind of Human Relations 101 of sorts. Also recommend 'The Sixty-Second Motivator' for further reading on motivational principles."^5^February 18, 2009

I'm very impressed with the amount of information and parent support on what parents can do to prevent learning loss over the summer.

When they took the gel polish off my nails one of them had split. It has been split from April 2013 to now, July 2016. That's 3 yrs. On day 9 it does not bother me at all. It has finally mended! I have had to keep it filed down to the quick. I had to keep a nail file with me everywhere I went, cause I didn't know when it was going snag something. I didn't realize the greens had so much protein in them. It also made me realize how much mindless eating I have been doing.  You'll see. It works. Just make up your mind and do it. Have 1 more day.

I was so curious I went out to buy it. I got it thru walmart.com. If you do so you will not only pay the cheapest price anywhere but whether you have it delivered to your house or site to store you will get great and speedy service. The book was absolutely great. Read it in 2 days. It is a very small book. But I couldn't put it down. Please take the chance and read it. It is extremely well written and keeps you thinking thru the whole movie. Ending was a litlle frustrating to me. You just don't know what to say after you read it. I hope this gets you more interest in reading it. You will be glad you did."^5^June 17, 2009

It takes a difficult time in history and breaks it down for someone who doesn't understand. Bruno doesn't understand what's happening and doesn't agree with the party line. Somehow a nine year old boy who doesn't 'get it' get's the Truth better than the grown-ups.

My daughter would often sing a song she learned at school, but I was unfamiliar with the song. It turned out to be on one of the CD's and now I am able to sing it with her. She gets so excited when she hears that particular song. I loved the quantity of songs for the price. I think the spiritual songs scattered throughtout were a bonus.

All of her cookbooks are colorful, beautiful and easy to lose yourself in. Yes in a cookbook. 

Only issue is they do not stay open to the page when your using it in the kitchen. Also the table of contents should have the recipe listing in the front.

Rilay, ^438978^4^2^"This book won’t control your mind, but it does have a lot to do with mind control. 1984 is a book written by George Orwell in 1949 depicting what Orwell believed that England would look like in the future. This book depicts a “Utopian” society that is ruled with an iron fist by the government who uses propaganda to control the population. Propaganda like “Big Brother is watching” is displayed on signs so that citizens know that the government is always watching and that the Thought Police are monitoring thoughts through “Tele-screens” (televisions). These Thought Police are used to track rebels who want to destroy the totalitarian government and bring freedom to the people.

The main character, Winston Smith, works for the government but sees the injustices going on around him. Winston breaks little rules here and there like writing a journal even though this is forbidden by the Thought Police. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth; a government building that changes history by “erasing” events from the past by changing photos, editing books, and completely removing people from history. The Ministry of Truth does this to control the knowledge of past successful rebel uprisings.

This is a great book that gives a lot of insight on what life is like in our society, even if we don’t recognize it on a daily basis. Orwell wasn't completely right with the date, however, I feel that our society is slowly reaching the point in which this book will no longer be “Fiction”. I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a story with a deep history and speculation. I had a great time reading this and i think you will too."^4^December 14, 2014

Andishop, ^145803129^6^2^"This book is highly recommended from my 11 yr. old. My son doesn't really like to read but said everyone should read. This book was on his school summer reading list originally he wasn't real happy that I ordered this book. He normally drags out his reading to the last minute but once he started reading he didn't really want to put this book down. Finished this book in about 5 days which was Great!! I didn't have to constantly remind him to read either. He now has talked almost everyone in the family into reading this book including his grandparents. When he finished the book he also said 'mom I shouldn't have judged a book by it's cover' :-).
The best part for me was not having to shop for it all over town, the quickness in ordering and receiving at my door the day the email showed we would receive (sooner then showed on the original order too). All the libraries had a waiting list so long that we would have never been able to check it out and not to mention the gas money I saved from not driving to every store in town."^5^August 10, 2009

look123, ^2664290^20^0^"After reading happiness books like 'Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World', I felt like I had a good handle on what science had uncovered about how to live a happy life and have to say that I am MUCH happier for having read them. But, while the field of positive psychology has made some great contributions to my happiness levels, it's books like 'The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment' that come along and let you know there's STILL more you can learn.

A key concept of the book (if I'm explaining it right) is that you will start to experience a certain kind of enlightenment when you learn to leave your analytical mind behind. In other words, instead of 'thinking' try just 'observing your thinking.' And when you do this, you also need to realize that all this 'thinking noise' that goes on in your head all day long is not really who you are- an enlightening concept indeed!

To that end, the book is set up in a question and answer format to help you get to understand these kinds of concepts. While it might seem ridiculous to some, it really isn't. Case in point, we all talk to ourselves or have witnessed others talking to themselves at times (maybe during a sporting event perhaps). If you ask someone who they are talking to, they will usually say 'I'm talking to myself.' And this, by definition, means that there have to be two 'selves', an 'I' talking to 'myself'- and so justifies the idea of two selves (a 'you' and a 'thinking you' in the book).

Well, if these seem to be the kind of concepts you're ready to explore, this is your book. It raises some good questions and certainly brings up one that you can't argue with: all we have is the here and now. As the book so astutely points out, 'Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing ever happened in the future, it will happen in the Now.' And learning to live in the now IS the point of the whole book."^5^January 28, 2009

KCTexas, ^44881883^32^3^"The good:
1. The recipes are exactly what you expect. Doable, delicious, and full of a variety of favors.
2. Great step-by-step pictures.
3. Easy to find ingredients.
4. Easy to follow instructions.
5. Much like the webpage, humorous and light.
The bad.
1. The book itself is of poor quality. The pages are falling away from the binding. I went to WalMart to return my copy, only to find that they are all having the same problem.
2. The book doesn't lay open flat on the counter, because of the type of binding used. When I open it to a recipe, depending on where in the book it is and where in relation to a weak spot, it may not stay open to that page without being weighted.

Overall, I like the cookbook. If it were just about the recipes, I would give it 5 stars, but I need it to be easily usable and more durable."^3^January 1, 2016

It also explains how she is still very special even though there is a new member of the family. I doubt she really understands that she herself will be a big sister soon, but it is still great to be able to talk to her about it in a way she can concretely see on the pages of the book.

I ordered it online and had it shipped to the store, the process was really quick and easy. That night my husband and son snuggled on the couch and read it. I was amazed, my son was completely captivated by the pictures and the story. After they had finished reading the story of David and Goliath my son ran into the kitchen and told me all about the story and was so animated about. For a child who is almost 3 to be able to tell me what he had learned in such detail was very impressive. Our 6 year old daughter even loves to hear the stories and look at the pictures!

Pamsmam, ^11991678^11^2^"My friend has always been interested in comic books and graphic novels, and he recently expressed an interest in becoming more familiar with the Bible. I was delighted to find a gift for him that combined the two interests. He is fascinated with the stories and the illustrations make it packed with action. I look forward to borrowing it when he's finished. We are adults, so I think this would be good for young adults and up, but the reader's parent or guardian should make that decision."^4^February 28, 2012

Salinacee, ^11991678^4^1^"I purchased three. One for myself, one for my grandson and one for his friend. Sergio is amazing.
His illustrations pull you in, very engaging. It is well done. My grandson is 8, he loves it. He would never be so captivated by just the written text at this age. The 'action' the pictures suggest makes
you curious, ' what is happening here'? It also makes a great gift for a kid who's family might be opposed to a standard Bible. I love it! I copied some of the pictures and made matching laminated
bookmarks."^5^November 15, 2013

Jesus definitely uses Sergio Cariello to illustrate and paint a FLAWLESS picture of God's word that makes it EASY to understand, FEEL and put into 'Action' His timeless word! It definitely appeals to ALL ages and generations! A beautiful presentation that's EASY to read. HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend! I'd also suggest the wonderful Devotional to go along with it!

Now that's he's headed to first grade and was introduced to religion class abc reading in kindergarten this a great step into keeping his favorite subject alive. We have to find ways to keep our children interested in the right things so they can continue to learn and move in the ways of The Lord. This action bible has done that for us.

rolltide333, ^52842714^6^0^"Usually, I am skeptical when I hear that everyone else likes a book or movie. I can't help to feel that it's being blown out of proportion and that it just can't be that good. This book is quite the exception.

Narrated by Death, this unique book explores many deep themes including death and dying (no surprise), the power of words, and the beauty of a good friendship. Liesel is a very well developed, three dimensional character, and the supporting characters only add to the amazing story. This book is different from other World-War II era novels, as it takes the view point of a German child. Very little is mentioned about the horrors of the Holocaust, but the book instead focuses on the average German during the war and also brings up several good questions, such as 'Was it right for the Allies to bomb civilians?'

Zusak proves to be a master of symbolism and metaphors - even the cover of the book (falling dominoes) symbolizes something far more treacherous. I've read this book three times, and pick up on something new every time I read it. It is by far the best book I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone.

Please don't skip over this book because it is labeled as 'young adult.' Just because the main character is a young girl doesn't mean only young girls can read this book. I think anyone, any age could enjoy this book; however, I think people over the age of 14 or 15 would get the most out of it.

Can't wait to see the movie!! (comes out in 2010)"^5^March 13, 2009
mojenkins, ^52842714^6^1^"The reason I decided to read the book thief because I saw there was a movie coming out about it. The trailer looked phenomenal and I have always loved books set in World War II. I purchased the book and I loved it! But loving it did not come automatically. It took me a couple of pages to realized who the narration for the tale was done by, but once I realized that the narration is given by death who stays with Leisel to witness her life, my view and expectations changed a bit and helped prepare me for the rest of the tale.

I anticipated it to be much like other tales based in Germany World War II and immediately start into a tale of survival in a war zone. It came to be more of a story of self-discovery for a young Leisel who has been taken from everything she knows to foster parents. The father lovingly teaches her to read, which she had always desired to learn, and through her love of reading she finds strong connections with others and understanding in a world of chaos.

A wonderful tale that through both the journey we take with our main character as well as pure literary genius helps us to fall in love with the written word all over again."^5^December 5, 2013

I preordered this cookbook from Walmart. I am not sure that it is that much of an improvement over the prior edition, although I have not seen it.

I do know that I have had to go on the internet to find recipes for boiled eggs, etc., simple things that should have been in the cookbook.

It's okay. I'm sure I will eventually try some of the recipes, but I wish it had some of the standard stove top pressure cooker recipes and adapted them for the electric pot.

MamaDuke09, ^10986750^54^6^"I like this cookbook because it is real food. . .not super fancy with ingredients that are hard to find. And I like how Pioneer Woman weaves the story of her family and life on the ranch into her recipes. Plus she is an incredible photographer and the cookbook provides step-by-step photos to go along with the recipes. She does the same thing on her blog but I think it may be easier to read in a book rather than on a website."^5^October 28, 2009
BPLKWW, ^10986750^36^1^"This book shouldn't be called a plain cookbook. Yes, it contains great recipes (many containing plenty of butter; if you are looking for low-fat, low-calorie dishes the pickings will be slim). There are not hundreds of recipes but a decent variety, and each has step by step instructions that will give even an inexperienced cook the confidence to try these recipes. What sets this cookbook apart is the author's folksy, goofy, good-natured humor; beautifully photographed color photos of every recipe and many photos of the preparation instructions; and glimpses into an Oklahoma rancher's life that makes you feel like you're part of the family, or at least a ranch hand. It's a fun read that will leave you hungry (literally!) for more."^5^December 2, 2011

Gunga2, ^10986750^32^5^"I bought this as a gift for my Mother-In-Law. She has recently become a fan of Pioneer Woman and is always talking about wanting to try some of her recipes. The price is much more reasonable through Walmart than at some of the big bookstores. The reason I say it is especially good for new fans is because it contains a nice introduction which tells how she met her husband and includes pictures of her family, the ranch, and some of the animals. However it would be a nice cookbook for long time fans as well. There are recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and appetizers with step by step illustrations to help you along. Recipes as simple as Guacamole on up to Creme' Brulee' but nothing that seems to require lots of expensive or hard to find ingredients. Plenty of comfort foods like pot roast, meatballs, pizza, sugar cookies, beans and cornbread, salads and so forth. This would make a nice wedding shower gift too."^4^May 9, 2014

JudaisHarlem, ^2602524^2^20^"Before I begin this metaphoric thrashing of this author, I must first clarify that I only gave this one star in all categories because this system will not allow me to rank it at zero. Furthering this idea, I will address this in two sections: the author, then the title itself.

To begin, this author is the absolute worst author I have ever had the displeasure of reading. It was like she hated the literary community and wanted to punish it and did so by way of a novel. I felt like her thoughts were confused and disconnected; furthermore, her use of language, if you detect any, was mediocre at best. She is, without a doubt, the single worst writer of any form of literature I have ever read, hands down.

Secondly, the subject matter itself is the absolute worst interpretation of the idea of vampires that I have ever read as well. Upon reading the first chapter of this book, I immediately felt the urge to vomit, followed by the need to cling to an Anne Rice novel as if it were an inhaler.

All in all, read this novel only if you feel a hatred toward literary works. This novel is ranked a 0.5 out of 10."^1^June 20, 2009

Sacapuntas26, ^2602524^1^0^"I read this book (for the first time) a couple years ago. It was our book club book. I was very hesitant to read it. A romance between a vampire and a young girl? It just is not the typical type of thing I read. I got hooked on the first couple pages and couldn't put it down. I have bought several copies of this book for family and friends and they all love it! My personal copy of all three books in this series are alway lent out.

SassyGirl1986, ^2602524^1^0^"The Twilight Series is my FAVOURITE series ever. I'm currently reading the series for the second time, and I'm sure I'll read the books many more times after this.
This book exceeds all of my expectations. It's romantic, suspensful, exciting, and it creates every emotional possible. The first time I read this book....I literally didn't put it down until I was finished. Even when I read it for the second time, it was hard to put it down!!!!
I first read the first three books by checking them out from the library, but the books were so good I HAD to own the copies for myself so I purchased them. :)

This books is about a girl named Bella, who moves to Forks, Washington - a small town where the sun hardly ever shines. She meets a mysterious guy who goes to her school, and falls in love with him....only to find out that he's a vampire. Despite the challenges they face....and they face a LOT of them....Bella and Edward face want to face them together.

After you read Twilight, be sure to read the following books in the series: New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn!!!!"^5^August 20, 2008

Shamussparks, ^2602524^1^0^"I picked this book up after hours of searching. I've always been into fantasy and although it's set in modern times, the lure of vampires got me interested. I picked this book up Tuesday and finished it today.

Wow, I had no idea this book was going to pull me in like it did. I'm familiar with Ann Rice, and don't get me wrong, love her dark seductive style, but I think this book nearly stands up in it's own kind of way.

If you're looking for a lighter vampire series, but still want depth and somthing to keep your attention, this is what you're looking for. Just my opinion, but when a book makes you feel what the characters are feeling, it's something worthwhile."^5^July 31, 2008

LGEdward, ^2602524^1^0^"Twilight is a very excellent book. Stephenie Meyer is an awesome writer and this book really keeps your attention. You always want to keep reading and know what is happening next. This book is about a teen girl named Bella Swan and she moves with her dad in a small town named Forks. When there she meets this very odd but beautiful family. They were the Cullens. She had an encounter with one of the Cullens named Edward and he saved her from a van and stopped it with his hand! She knew that there was something odd there but she wasn't sure what. Of coarse i won't tell you more because I want you to enjoy the book. It is really an intreaguing book. Through the story she shares a wonderful love with Edward Cullen and they go through life threatening things together but they love each other and keep themselves going. You will very much enjoy this book with its romance but its addicting action as well. I have read all of the Twilight books and i am reading them again for a second time. I do recomend this book. I hope you enjoy it."^5^April 11, 2009
Bearcat440, ^2602524^1^0^"I absolutely love this book! Meyer is an excellent writer, who does an exceptional job at captivating her audience and makes you relate to the characters unlike anything you've experienced before. It makes me wish I was living the story myself! At times, you may even have a hard time remembering that the story is fictional and not real. While reading this book I am 100% positive that you will be spellbound or entranced like myself. I literally couldn't put it down or continue with my daily routine until I finished it. I can say without any doubt that this is the best book I have ever read. The others in the series follow the same suit! Be sure to read them all, you won't be disappointed!!!"^5^January 5, 2009
rehtaeh, ^2602524^1^0^"My friend had been trying to get me to read this series for some time now. I finally gave in when I found out that the movie was coming out soon and I didn't want the movie to spoil the book for me.
I had the book read within a few days (and I work full-time). It ranks up there with Harry Potter. I couldn't put it down, and thought about it non-stop when I wasn't reading.
The only downfall to this book... you may become completely obsessed. :-) Oh, and you'll have to go out and buy the other 3 books later to find out what happens next. :-D
** Also, Wal-Mart has the best price around. And if you want the hardback version, you will most likely have to buy it online. I went to about 5 Wal-Marts and they only carried the first 2 books in paperback [the same with k-mart, sears, target, etc...]. The only stores I could find it in hardback were Borders and Barnes & Noble, but they were around $20 + tax. Online from Wal-Mart is the way to go. :-)"^5^October 27, 2008
Leconel, ^2602524^1^1^"I originally bought this book for my little sister. Her best friend was reading it and so she wanted to read it too. My sister isn't the best reader in the world, but practice makes perfect. So I've been trying to get her to read more for quite some time. I was thrilled that she wanted to read anything, so I bought her this book. She started reading it and loved it.
Then she proceeded to pester me nonstop about how I would like the book if I were to read it. So I read the first few pages, and I too was hooked. It's hard to put down once you start.
The only gripe I could possible make about the book is that it's a little dramatic. Although it's probably very realistic for a 17/18 year old to be that dramatic about her first real love. So take it as you will."^5^May 15, 2008

I sometimes will read and find in enjoyable when I'm into the story, but I have never been able to read for more than 45 minutes, I get bored and have to go move around. It's almost impossible to read a book really quick for me. I usually spend a few weeks on it bepending on the length. I got this book 2 days ago and I'm already over thalf way through, I will sit and read it all day long and not feel like I have to move or anything. I can't put it down!

She bought a set and unfortunately I lost her to cancer this last December before she could enjoy them. She would share books with my sister-in-law and one of things sister-in-law said when she visited me recently in Arizona was she wished she could have gotten the set from my mom. So I sent all four of them to her for her birthday.
The books story, pull you in to the idea we all have as that ordinary girl, who no one notices. Until she meets her prince charming, who is handsome and protective and dangerous all wrapped in one package.

Sclobbi, ^2602524^1^0^"When I first came back to school from summer vacation, a small number of people were reading this book, and more were already reading Eclipse (book 3 in the saga). I asked about them. All i found out was that it was some kind of chick-flick. Later, I got more interested when I saw the trailer of the movie, and saw that there is some action in there as well. Now it's funny how when you read a book like this, you're called weird. No one I know has done so...though internet people do. This book is full of everything. Romance, Suspense, Action, and much more...
Small intro:
Bella Swan is going away to live with her dad due to her mom's new baseball player husband having to go around for many baseball tours and stuff... New girl in the middle of the semester isn't quite happy. She soon meets a strange family of extremey beautiful people, who seem to be the mysterious bunch in school.
Anyway. This book Is REALLY worth your time. And Guys out there...no major spoilers...but E*W**D Will help you with many tips with the ladies ;p

I received it on the 24th of December and by the next morning I had read the whole book. I was so enthralled by the story that I just couldn't put it down. Though I have read several books in one setting, this one was so vivid and the characters were so 'real' (Bella reminded me of myself when I was in high school, and if Edward wasn't a vampire I could see him being one of those gorgeous unattainable guys in Biology class or at the corner table in the cafeteria). I would definitely recommend this book, and I'm going to go out and get the next two books in the series immediatly."^5^December 26, 2007

This book takes everything to the next level. The author really pulls things together and everything just clicks. Really well done on her part.

The only problem that I had was being able to finish the book because every time that I tried to read it, another one of my friends would ask to borrow it. The book have so much imagery, I think that they are even better then Harry Potter. They are suitable for every age group I am in 8th grade and I read them, my collage friends reads them, my best friends mom who is 45 reads them. So I think that you get the point. IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THESE BOOK I ORDER YOU TO STOP DOING EVERYTHING EXCEPT BREATHING, GO BUY THE BOOKS TWILIGHT, NEW MOON, AND ECLIPSE AND READ THEM. NOW!!!! Thank you. And have a nice day."^5^October 6, 2007
EireLady, ^10763775^4^53^"I don't really like this book at all. I love to read a long book when it's worth reading, but this one could have been cut down to about half of what it is and the story would still have been relayed just fine. Where to start? First of all, Bella. She irritates me to no end in this one. Why on earth is she vacillating between Jacob and Edward?? Edward is far better than Jacob. Even if you are a member of Team Jacob, I think it's really cruel of Bella to keep hurting both guys like this. Bella has a great life, yet all she does is whine and worry and cause problems for others around her. She is very selfish. I really don't understand what either Edward *or* Jacob sees in her. What a worthless heroine.
Second, I was really annoyed with how shmex-crazed Bella is. Usually, it's the males who would be playing this role, yet here is Bella, constantly pushing the limits and begging Edward to do inappropriate things. Disgusting. And it gets even worse in book four. I'm sorry to use such frank languague, but there you go. I can't believe all the mothers allowing their young daughters to read this. I just like to imagine that the books stopped with New Moon, and then I can come up with my own ending."^2^November 11, 2009
Nursing, ^10763775^3^1^"I really enjoyed reading this one. Better than New Moon in my opinion. I was having Edward withdrawals in that one, j/k. The whole book was great, and it gets better towards the end."^5^February 24, 2009
LoveAGoodBook, ^10763775^3^0^"This 3rd book is awesome! I don't like fantasy, but she drags you into this world of vampires and werewolves she has created just like Harry Potter!

Jmoore, ^10763775^2^0^"Eclipse is totally implausible and lacks continuity in Meyer's characterization of Bella, BUT it was still an excellent read.

^10763775^1^0^"For anybody who likes Jake will certainly like this book more than people who adore Edward more. I happen to LOVE Edward and though that this book was fantastic. The characters personalities change but they are the same characters we've known and love. In my point of view this book didn't really seem like a sequel to New Moon. It seemed like the book broadened the questions that needed to be answered on New Moon. To me it seemed that it wrecked some relationships more or less. But people should buy this book and other Stephenie Meyer novels because they are awesome!! Once again I loved this book and cannot wait until Breaking Dawn is realeased!!"^5^August 9, 2007
BobK, ^10763775^1^0^"This book was so good. I have read Twilight and New Moon, and am now looking forward to Breaking Dawn.

It shows who many would considered to be barbarous to actually were very patient and sacrificing for the chance to not terrorize a whole natio.n.
Book speaks of wisdom in events that changed history and shifting of power. Along with those it also tells the bad outcomes from a decisions of many in history on issues that we may want to think about twice. History always repeated itself as we are people of habits.

these books are addictive...i feel like i know the characters! these books seem intimidating b/c of the size but i read these faster than normal books!
the only complaint i have about new moon is that it is a little confusing at the end in italy! i felt like i had missed something... just keep reading and it clears out!

I get lost in the story. I was never a big reader before, couldn't even read so much as a magazine article without getting completely bored, but I bought these books and I don't know why I hadn't bought them sooner! a twilight fan or not, I think everyone should read these books, they are amazing!"^5^September 16, 2009

MissFreedom, ^8096365^2^0^"While I started out NOT wanting to join the hype and pre-teens that surround the 'Twilight' series (since I could be those girls' mother), I gave in by reading the first book, and when I couldn't put it down, I had to buy the next, 'New Moon.' Again, Meyer weaves her web of fantasy without losing the main point: love and the troubles that sometime face it. It's a great book (and series) for anyone to read. It's an escape from reality, but not so far that you cannot relate to it."^4^March 29, 2010

Michelle008, ^8096365^2^0^"New moon by Stephenie Meyer, a 547 page book of greatness. Once I had read the first twilight book, I knew the next one would only get better. From the start, the book had me attached. It is full of suspense and romance. Edward and Bella's love is anything but easy, but they somehow manage to work things out. As readers may already know, Edward is a vampire and Bella is just a normal human being. She finds herself having to go through several obstacles in order to be with her one true love. The obstacles she had to face were not easy either, she got herself into a situation where shes dating a vampire lives off of blood, especially human blood, Bella is a human. The plot was so intense for me that my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe what was just about to happen. In order to find and experience what I experienced, you need to read the book, you won't regret it. I personally love romantic story's so if you are someone like me, I would totally recommend this book. Not to mention the suspense that is also included. I give this book 5 stars for various reasons but mainly because it kept me wanting more and more. The ending left me in suspense so I am definitely going to go on to the next book. I can't even imagine what the next book has in store for us readers, I would recommend starting with the first book of the series though, that way you readers can actually understand everything."^5^May 24, 2013
annett, ^8096365^1^7^"Ok I read Twilight I still don't get to see Edward tell his side of the story. So I figure it is Bella's Story. Now I read 'New Moon' I was disappointed that it is Jacob telling the story. He become a werewolf. Something not by choice and he hate it. I need to know why Bella suddenly become so whining, selfish and weak in this book. I can see in this book that Jacob is her bestfriend and she is just using him for replacement. What a dork. What about the rest of the boys and other at her school. They asked her out in the previous book. Why they suddenly disappear from this novel. The book is good but the story is so slow and I get impatient and skip to the ending to finish it."^3^February 16, 2009

^8096365^1^1^"Not much is needed to explain how great this book is. I could re-read it everyday, it never looses its intrest. You completely fall in love with the characters but one must read twilight first! It may seem like a chick/romance book but I got my mom AND dad to read it!"^5^July 21, 2007
EireLady, ^8096365^1^0^"A lot of people say that this is the most depressing book in the series because of all the sad things that happen in it, but it's my favorite one. This takes place before the series goes downhill in Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, and before Bella becomes unbearable. I love books that explore deep human emotions, and this is one of them. It's not an excellent piece of literature to be sure, but I like to read it anyway. I loved it how, with the two main characters being apart, we got to see how much Bella really loves Edward and how attached she is to him. It was heartbreaking and interesting to see how Bella got through and what she did with half of her soul missing. Hey, the tone of the book fits my mood when I'm down, so it kind of helps to read about someone who's going through a harder time than I am."^4^November 11, 2009

RayBabe, ^8096365^0^4^"This book was difficult for me to read at times. Edward leaves and Bella sinks into a downward spiral. Her pain is so real and gut-wrenching to read. But an old friend, Jacob Black, appears and helps Bella in her healing process and she starts to believe another life is possible for her. Jacob is warm, kind, loving and funny. It was good to get to know his character, but Edward already has my heart. I was stressing that I wouldn't see Edward anymore, but fate changes everything and with it brings a return of Edward. Not quite as good as Twilight, but still a must read!"^4^August 30, 2007

gianna1979, ^2377138^5^27^"Let me say that my family and I have a great sense of humor but...
I can not imagine exposing a child to this book and I have to wonder about the author...I gave it one star only because this site does not allow NO stars.
The first thing I read was a full page about how someone ate a baby and her things would have to be given away and how they would not have to wipe her nose any more or check to see if she was dry...
Then there is the delightful little thing about a person not having anything to put in stew so they will cook themselves and not scream while they are being boiled..and it reminds you to enjoy them with crackers...
There is the happy little mood-lifter about the Googies, who come to buy children....50 cents for the fat ones, thirty cents for the clean ones and so on....
Can't forget the kid who is grabbed by an eagle and 'he dropped me in a boiling lake a thousand miles wide and you'll never guess what I did then--I DIED.'
Can not overlook the one about being eaten by a boa constrictor.."^1^February 26, 2012

TheAngelSoldier, ^5512335^6^0^"This is probably one of the best books out there in my opinion to help you discover your strengths but you will get what you pay for, a lot of work still needs to be done on your own though. If I had to buy it again, I would, I just wish the test that you pay for could be taken as many times as you possibly want to. You can only take the test once and that's it. I'm happy overall because this book can lead to more sources like being coached by Gallup coaches. But that's worth more than a a few bucks, we're taking a few hundred bucks and for me that's where I think the real finding out your own strengths lives. Thank you !!!"^3^March 8, 2013

Can you describe how you do those things? Talent is difficult to describe. What I love most about this product is your report is unique - even if we shared the same strengths, the descriptions of those strengths would differ. Worth every penny - I help individuals and teams use this tool to become more collaborative and higher performing. Buy new - the code can only be used once."^5^February 7, 2011
Noah64, ^5512335^3^0^"I had borrowed a copy of the progenitor book 'Now, Discover Your Strengths' from a friend and found it somewhat interesting. That copy's test access code had been used, so I purchased this book solely to get a code for taking the test. I would have gladly paid the same amount to just take the test, but buying a book is the only way to get access.

While reading the older edition, I wrote down what I considered to be my top five strengths. The list from the test did not overlap at all with my list. I could see how my answers led to the results given, but I'm not persuaded that the test is more accurate than my self-assessment."^2^January 6, 2012
shoppinginNJ11, ^5512335^2^0^"While the results were helpful, I am glad I purchased at Walmart cause if I had paid more, it wouldn't have been worth it.

Upon review now it does say (right below the star rating) 'Board Books.' When it arrived, I was surprised it was a BOARD BOOK, not the standard format. I checked the website just now and presumably the full-size format book is also listed for $6 as 'hardcover' but it is 72 pages. What are we missing?

these books are addictive...i feel like i know the characters! these books seem intimidating b/c of the size but i read these faster than normal books!
the only complaint i have about new moon is that it is a little confusing at the end in italy! i felt like i had missed something... just keep reading and it clears out!

Again, Meyer weaves her web of fantasy without losing the main point: love and the troubles that sometime face it. It's a great book (and series) for anyone to read. It's an escape from reality, but not so far that you cannot relate to it."^4^March 29, 2010

Michelle008, ^8096365^2^0^"New moon by Stephenie Meyer, a 547 page book of greatness. Once I had read the first twilight book, I knew the next one would only get better. From the start, the book had me attached. It is full of suspense and romance. Edward and Bella's love is anything but easy, but they somehow manage to work things out. As readers may already know, Edward is a vampire and Bella is just a normal human being. She finds herself having to go through several obstacles in order to be with her one true love. The obstacles she had to face were not easy either, she got herself into a situation where shes dating a vampire lives off of blood, especially human blood, Bella is a human. The plot was so intense for me that my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe what was just about to happen. In order to find and experience what I experienced, you need to read the book, you won't regret it. I personally love romantic story's so if you are someone like me, I would totally recommend this book. Not to mention the suspense that is also included. I give this book 5 stars for various reasons but mainly because it kept me wanting more and more. The ending left me in suspense so I am definitely going to go on to the next book. I can't even imagine what the next book has in store for us readers, I would recommend starting with the first book of the series though, that way you readers can actually understand everything."^5^May 24, 2013
annett, ^8096365^1^7^"Ok I read Twilight I still don't get to see Edward tell his side of the story. So I figure it is Bella's Story. Now I read 'New Moon' I was disappointed that it is Jacob telling the story. He become a werewolf. Something not by choice and he hate it. I need to know why Bella suddenly become so whining, selfish and weak in this book. I can see in this book that Jacob is her bestfriend and she is just using him for replacement. What a dork. What about the rest of the boys and other at her school. They asked her out in the previous book. Why they suddenly disappear from this novel. The book is good but the story is so slow and I get impatient and skip to the ending to finish it."^3^February 16, 2009

EireLady, ^8096365^1^0^"A lot of people say that this is the most depressing book in the series because of all the sad things that happen in it, but it's my favorite one. This takes place before the series goes downhill in Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, and before Bella becomes unbearable. I love books that explore deep human emotions, and this is one of them. It's not an excellent piece of literature to be sure, but I like to read it anyway. I loved it how, with the two main characters being apart, we got to see how much Bella really loves Edward and how attached she is to him. It was heartbreaking and interesting to see how Bella got through and what she did with half of her soul missing. Hey, the tone of the book fits my mood when I'm down, so it kind of helps to read about someone who's going through a harder time than I am."^4^November 11, 2009

But an old friend, Jacob Black, appears and helps Bella in her healing process and she starts to believe another life is possible for her. Jacob is warm, kind, loving and funny. It was good to get to know his character, but Edward already has my heart. I was stressing that I wouldn't see Edward anymore, but fate changes everything and with it brings a return of Edward. Not quite as good as Twilight, but still a must read!"^4^August 30, 2007

gianna1979, ^2377138^5^27^"Let me say that my family and I have a great sense of humor but...
I can not imagine exposing a child to this book and I have to wonder about the author...I gave it one star only because this site does not allow NO stars.
The first thing I read was a full page about how someone ate a baby and her things would have to be given away and how they would not have to wipe her nose any more or check to see if she was dry...
Then there is the delightful little thing about a person not having anything to put in stew so they will cook themselves and not scream while they are being boiled..and it reminds you to enjoy them with crackers...
There is the happy little mood-lifter about the Googies, who come to buy children....50 cents for the fat ones, thirty cents for the clean ones and so on....
Can't forget the kid who is grabbed by an eagle and 'he dropped me in a boiling lake a thousand miles wide and you'll never guess what I did then--I DIED.'
Can not overlook the one about being eaten by a boa constrictor.."^1^February 26, 2012

TheAngelSoldier, ^5512335^6^0^"This is probably one of the best books out there in my opinion to help you discover your strengths but you will get what you pay for, a lot of work still needs to be done on your own though. If I had to buy it again, I would, I just wish the test that you pay for could be taken as many times as you possibly want to. You can only take the test once and that's it. I'm happy overall because this book can lead to more sources like being coached by Gallup coaches. But that's worth more than a a few bucks, we're taking a few hundred bucks and for me that's where I think the real finding out your own strengths lives. Thank you !!!"^3^March 8, 2013

That copy's test access code had been used, so I purchased this book solely to get a code for taking the test. I would have gladly paid the same amount to just take the test, but buying a book is the only way to get access.

While reading the older edition, I wrote down what I considered to be my top five strengths. The list from the test did not overlap at all with my list. I could see how my answers led to the results given, but I'm not persuaded that the test is more accurate than my self-assessment."^2^January 6, 2012

The details in the book are very well wrote. I would reccomend reading this book. Can't wait to see the movie!"^5^February 22, 2010
Lariat, ^4406976^4^0^"I bought this book for my eight year old daughter. She loves Xena and Hercules and I knew she would like the Greek mythology in this book. I decided to read chapter one to see if it looked interesting; I couldn't put the book down! It is very interesting for any age. I highly recommend it. My daughter loves it, too! It is very well written, fast paced, and original."^5^June 30, 2010
RickMeister, ^4406976^2^0^"My fourth grader has read over 200 pages of this book during the last couple weeks. Although he prefers the 39 Clues serious for more action, I find this book a more valuable reading accomplishment.
The exposure to mythology will help to pronounce the names. But, more importantly, if you are on the AR system for reading, this book is worth 13 points. Riordan's 39 Clue book was worth several points and is what helped to choose our current title. Having seen the recent flim also helped to make the title a good current choice.
I have chose this book to let the youngster realize that even a thick book can be overcome.

He's really enjoying the book and identifies the differences between the written title and the film. The chapters about the St. Louis Arch have sparked new interest and we hope to have the last half completed in the next couple weeks.

I would not advise this title for a student who has not accumulated enough reading points to go without testing during the amount of time required to complete this title. If you're reading with your child, you'll know if this is a title for your child.

But, this is the best price I've found for new product. Scholastic also has rereleased this title with a more flashy cover. Following along with my son I can assure you each cover contains the same story word for word. Save the six bucks and buy this version.

Also consider the boxed set for more reading at better savings."^5^March 14, 2011

My son says, 'The book is hilarious. I read it from to start to finish. Believe me it's hard to get me to do that. As for the characters, the parents and adults were insane and the kids were either selfish, stupid or very young. In other words they were all nuts.'"^5^September 21, 2009

mybarman, ^5299928^23^87^"I know this book is popular, but that is unfortunate. I wrote to my son's' elementary school principal that I had reviewed this book, brought home from the school library. The principal agreed that the book has no redeeming quality, except it gets kids to read.

How sad that books are now promoted based on childrens discernments, rather than adults.

The problem is that the book depicts the middle school experience as one of mean kids, bad irrelevant teachers, negative references to police and authority...the list goes on and on.

Suffice to say, that it probably isn't a good idean to paint school and the many relationships inherent to school are negative and unreal. Not the message I want pounded into my child.

There are great biographies, and entertianing yet educational books too many to count, why dumb down kids?"^1^December 27, 2008

Joecr, ^403453^9^2^"I have read hundreds of books on business, Sam Walton's autobiography is one of the best without the academic jargon. It is simple, warm, and shows the character of a good and caring man. It also reveals the principles for success in business in a competitive environment. Years before they went bankrupt, I went into a competitors store and saw future failure in every area. They should have applied the thing in Sam's book instead of playing the Wall Street big-shots.

marriedutopianstriver, ^403453^6^1^"I felt compelled to check out “Made In America” by Sam Walton out of curiosity and pride with being a Walmart employee. I was exposed to some of Walton’s philosophy during my orientation and felt curious to check out more. The following are some of the tidbits included in “Made In America” by Sam Walton:
Pages 1-3: He mentions how his life changed after interviewing with Forbes magazine in October 1985 (after he was named the “richest man in America). A harrowing experience is also recalled when he talks about being “ambushed by The Lifestyles Of The Rich and Famous Guy” at a tennis tournament.
Page 70: Jim Walton recalled how some writers thought that his father (Sam Walton) was a “grand strategist who psychically carried out plans and actualized them with precision”. However, he mentions that the reality was that his father actually “thrived on change” when it came to many decisions.
Pages 80-81: Sam Walton listed some of his family pictures such as those of this parents and grandparents, as well as his wife, children, and a Ben Franklin franchise in Newport, Arkansas.
Page 95: Sam Walton created and wrote down a five year plan of the business ideas that he intended to accomplish. He mentioned that he saved these plans for a long time and found (several years later) that his target goals were exceeded by at least 15 to 20 percent.
Pages 240-241: There is an inclusion of more pictures from Sam Walton’s years with Walmart such as a happy picture of him with his wife Helen. There is also a fascinating 1990 feature of HillaryClinton as Wal-Mart’s Board of Directors.
There is also a postscript by Rob Walton due to the fact that Sam Walton was in the final stages of his life when writing this book. There is much more featured in “Made in America” by Sam Walton for those who are curious to know more about the founder behind Walmart and the actual company of Walmart."^5^November 29, 2013

Other books I have worked have had missing vowel, angles, boxes, movies, short stories, and etc."^3^October 21, 2016

It's cute and the drawings are simple and fun, but I wasn't enthralled, my daughter however loved it and related to little Trixie. We've read this a million times.

elle0467, ^5772610^1^0^"Knuffle Bunny is a sweet story of a little girl Trixie who throws a tantrum because she misplaces her knuffle bunny in one of the machines. This is a great book to relate to students when they once upon a time lost something that they held dear to their hearts."^4^February 25, 2009
ChristineRobinson, ^5772610^1^0^"A book that resonates with the very young and their parents, especially those who have a 'special' toy. The story is typical, as Trixie heads to the Laundromat with her dad and then along the way loses her precious Knuffle Bunny. What makes this story unusual is Willems ability to portray Trixie's frustration (a laugh out loud 'boneless' episode that any parent will identify with being the highlight) and the unique artistic style of colourful cartoon characters set against black and white photos of the city. My daughters love this book"^5^July 27, 2010
DayehSensei, ^5772610^1^0^"An adorable tale of a young toddler (Trixie) who loves going to the laundromat with her Dad. During one of her visits, she forgets her favorite stuffed animal at the laundromat, and despite multiple (humorous) fits, she fails to communicate what's wrong to her Dad. Dad eventually saves the day by retrieving the bunny-- and Trixie surprises everyone by exclaiming its name. Super book!"^5^July 23, 2011
ErikSalvail, ^5772610^1^0^"Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale is a really great early reader book by Mo Willems, who has a creative style of illustrating that is a sure eye catcher. When Trixie and her father go to the laundry mat, there is a terrible occurrence when Knuffle Bunny goes missing. When someone, or something we hold dear disappears, we're not likely to take it well. Mo Willems uses illustrations over photography, giving a wonderful new twist to the picture book. I really loved this book, and highly recommend it to all readers and early grade classrooms."^4^October 22, 2009
katietwa08, ^5772610^1^0^"This is an adorable story complete with unusual pictures that incorporate real world images with cartoon characters. Sure to catch any eye, this story will keep the reader hooked with an active layout and loveable characters. The story is so well written -- as though you are in the mind of the child. It is sure to be a family or classroom favorite."^5^December 19, 2011
randirousseau, ^5772610^1^0^"I discovered Knuffle Bunny only very recently at a library conference - and fell in love. It's very fun, and sweetly drawn, and would appeal to little kids learning to read - not a lot of words per page, good pace, happy ending. What more can a kid want? And any parent of a child with that special toy or blanket will appreciate the story, too."^5^May 13, 2009
lisab818, ^5772610^1^0^"Mo Willems deserves to win the Caldecott for this one! Trixie and her dad go to the laundromat, and Knuffle Bunny accidentally gets left in the washing machine. When she realizes what happens, Trixie tries to tell her dad what's wrong, but is too young to speak. 'Knuffle Bunny' ends up being her first words. The artwork combines black and white photography with color, cartoonish characters. A beautiful and unique combination!

The edges are so ragged like what a kid will do when cutting sheets of paper to put together a journal. There is no smoothness to the edges. No more than ten pages have edges that are same length and smoothness. What a mess!!

Lee Child knows how to keep one on the edge of their seat, hanging on for dear life and turning pages one after another but not daring to miss a word. There are too many twists and turns that can be missed if a sentence goes unread.
One dose of Lee Child and Jack Reacher is not nearly enough. I'm on my ninth straight right now, waiting for #17 with bated breath."^5^August 13, 2012

This book is an eye opener for everyone who is dealing with financial difficulties and ways to save and invest your earnings. It doesn't always matter how much you make but what you do with what you make. Wise decisions and a dollar saved today may go a long way tommorrow. Being wise instead of foolish makes a big difference and tells what kind of character you are."^4^April 23, 2009

confusedturtle, ^4231264^17^2^"I am actually on here buying my 4th book as I have used one of these for every pregnancy and have recently found out I am pregnant again. It keeps track of all of your info begining with finding out your pregnant, yours and your families reactions and goes on until after you have the baby, and what happens at all of your doctor visits, ultrasounds, meds, testing and even a section for baby shower gifts, comparing prices on certain products and maternity clothes etc.
With every doctor visit I am so nervous and forgetful I usually leave thinking I shouldve asked this or that, but since getting this book a few weeks into my first pregnancy I have been able to ask the questions I probably would have forgotten and write down all of my doctors instructions so that I couldn't forget them. Hubby (or mom, whoever was able to) helped me fill out the during labor section and I filled out the diary and everything else. One day I hope to pass these on to my kids when they have a child on the way so they can look back and see what they should ask or what is normal or not, and also so they will see just how much they were loved, even before they were born.
Not only would I refer this to a friend but I have bought one for all of my sister in laws and have told all of my pregnant friends about them so they can do this too :-)"^5^August 12, 2011
CandA2002, ^4231264^11^3^"I used this journal in my first pregnancy, and now (regrettably) using The Belly Book journal for my 2nd pregnancy. The What to Expect journal is amazing. It is loaded with pages and has so much you can write. It also goes by day, (for example, 5 weeks 1 day pregnant, and you write the info for that day) instead of by week, like The Belly Book does. It has a slot in the back to keep appointment cards or other info, and has tons of questions, like how you want the birth to go, and how you felt finding out about the pregnancy. It even has a place for you to put registry info, birth announcement list, a daily food log, and even info postpartum, like how your 6 week checkup went. It will track every detail of what happened in your pregnancy. If you're trying to decide between this and The Belly Book...GO WITH THIS ONE. From someone who has both, they don't even compare, in my opinion."^5^October 9, 2013

I had the same book when I was pregnant with my second kid and got it again with this pregnancy! After having a baby, everything gets so hectic and you forget the little things about your pregnancy. It's almost like being pregnant all over again when you go back and read everything! It's amazing! It has places for pictures of Mommy on the first month page, second month page, and so on. It also has a place in the front and back to hold your sonogram pictures in it. It asks soooo many questions about you and baby and daddy! You kind of get to know yourself all over again. lol. This book is very detail oriented even if your not. It has a list of things you should have for the baby before he or she arrives. This is an awesome book!! I highly recommend it!"^5^April 5, 2012
bb201112, ^4231264^2^0^"She really loves it and writes in it everyday! It is VERY DETAILED! It covers pretty much everything you could think of to document during your pregnancy. The only thing I didn't particularly care for is that it is not hard cover..it is binded like a spiral notebook and I didn't like that. It seems like it could fall apart or come loose too easy. Like I said though, I bought this for a friend (who does not share my opinion on the binding) and that is just how I feel about it. It really is a cute little book though. Could be a thoughtful gift for anyone who loves to write/document or someone who is on bedrest..there is close to 300 pages, i think."^5^February 11, 2014

I do love this book, though, so that I can record everything. I just don't think it is as user-friendly as it used to be."^4^October 5, 2012
Keri4261, ^4231264^1^1^"This is a great organizer and journal. We liked it so much we bought it for our second pregnancy as well.
The book keeps track of your pregnancy by month, week, day. It has ample space to jot down your thoughts, happenings each day. We really liked how the book is divided into sections. We were able to track our baby's growth in the dr. Visit portion. It has a place for tracking the heart beat, fundus growth, and much more. There is also a section to prepare for baby's arrival, registry ideas, important phone numbers, birth plan, and so much more.

This journal/organizer is the perfect size to throw in a purse to have it handy for appts, everyday, etc. I found it to be particularly useful with my 1st pregnancy and enjoyed filling out the journal everyday.

She has been reading it and is now asking questions. She has always known that she was able to talk to me about anything but this has opened up new things and questions that she did not know that she had. She is even taking notes..wierd huh!

jessyslibrary, ^14015043^15^2^"Sometimes we as parents find it difficult to express to our children aspects of the Bible. While we know and understand they want to know and understand. I am reading a book with my two boys called 'Jesus Calling 365 devotions for kids' by Sarah Young and adapted by Tama Fortner. This is an awesome book! It breaks down scripture to a language that children not only understand but find entertaining. The Bible says to talk with your children about God every day and this is a great way to do that. Read to them and have them tell you what they got out of it. Try it and see!"^4^September 29, 2010

It gives you insight into the mind of teenagers faced with their own mortality, as if teenage angst wasn't enough to deal with already. It puts things in perspective as to what is really important. This was an emotional thrill ride and I enjoyed every high and low. Would recommend this book to anyone who welcomes such a ride!!!! Kudos to John Green."^5^April 12, 2014

I recommend this book for anybody wishing to be addicted to a book, you really cant put it down without feeling guilty. I have now lent this book to three more friends, who all love it and John Green. I first was introduced to John Green through this book, though have taken to reading two more, The Abundance of Katherines (my favorite) and Paper Towns (also amazing). Soon I hope to read Looking For Alaska. Everybody must read this book and fall in love with John Green like I did!"^5^July 14, 2013
WillSant04, ^35394798^4^0^"In The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, he builds a story out of darkness and despair. He takes the tragedy of cancer and immerses us in the lives of characters that could very well be real. Many know of the heartaches in dealing with those who fight the fight, and many of those scars last a lifetime. He brings his story in the form of a teen girl, Hazel Lancaster. Stricken with cancer from a young age, she believes she has come to terms with what her life has become. Then she meets a young man, Augustus Waters, a survivor of cancer. He is drawn to her in a way that is initially uncomfortable, and as she tries to push him away in her sarcastic vein, he finds her to be exactly the type of girl he has been looking for. For cancer touches not just the victim but all those who have loved and are in anyway touched by them. One should be prepared for a story of romance, anger, excitement and humor, and friendship and bravery for that is the way we are led as Green develops the personality of a group of teens that have the courage to bring both laughter and tears. Hidden within that strength they also hide the depression and hopelessness as they try hard to protect their family and friends by showing only the smiles and strength whenever possible. The friendships as well as the depths the families go through preparing for the worst while holding out hope is like a beacon of light.
The courage and humor, the energy and sadness all keep you on a roller coaster of emotion. Green takes you on a journey both terrible and beautiful."^4^October 28, 2014

erinmm, ^35394798^1^53^"I went into this thinking it was going to be clean, written by a Christian and all. I was mistaken and that's all good, we all have different views about what a sin is and all of that. So, that was surprising to me, but the way the book was written...It was horrible. The characters weren't very believable, their conversations didn't make sense a lot of the time. I have a good friend who had Cystic Fibrosis and at this moment is dying. In ICU, barely hanging on. So that the girl complained about not remembering what it felt like to have working lungs really upset me. She did at one point have healthy lungs. I suppose if you don't know someone who has been worse off than the characters or you like books simply because the majority of people are amazed by them (50 Shades, Twilight...) then you might like this one too."^1^February 14, 2014

I, on the other hand, was looking for a good basic canning guide with lots of recipes.  I already know how to can but it's a pain looking up the latest safety guidelines etc. for tomatoes or trying to find a resource I trust for things like pie filling using cook-type clear gel (so you don't have to heat the filling up and add thickener when it's time to use it).  Alas, this was not the book for me as it tweaked basics like tomato juice and omitted any alternative to cornstarch as a thickener for pie filling.  It did include a good bone broth recipe...and a handful of basic charts for canning things like pears or green beans, so it wasn't a complete waste.  I just wish they had included traditional recipes alongside their 'tweaked' ones so that I wouldn't have to keep looking for some of the basics time and again."^3^June 2, 2016

ncgraham, ^659358^4^0^"Here, ladies and gentlemen, we have a classic example of the infamous 'sophomore slump.' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets cannot, unlike its predecessor, rest its laurels on J. K. Rowling's world-building and the charm of the characters. We have already met Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the cast. We have already had the delightful experience of discovering Hogwarts for the first time. Now it was up to Rowling to ratchet up the intensity of the series either by increasing the stakes or delving more deeply into Harry's psychology. She doesn't do nearly enough of either. I suppose that, from an objective perspective, the stakes are a little higher. Evil not only threatens the world of Hogwarts in this book: it touches it, leaves a mark on it. The Chamber of Secrets (like the Stone of the preceding book, the exact nature of the Chamber is kept a mystery for much of the story) is opened somewhere within the school's walls, and students are found petrified in the hallways. Yet in spite of all this, I didn't feel there was as much at risk as in Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone. I never doubted that there would be a cure for a petrifaction, and knew that the threat itself would eventually be eradicated. So the danger here really isn't much more than a long nap, is it? I didn't think there was anything in here to match the Forbidden Forest chapter for suspense and thrills. One of my main complaints about the book is the tedious rehearsal of everything that happened in Sorcerer's Stone during the opening chapters (and I do mean everything). I'm sure it's useful for those who somehow missed the first book, or hadn't read it in awhile, but for those who are coming Chamber it right off of Sorcerer's Stone, the repetition is unnecessary and irritating. I'm not especially fond of the new characters Rowling incorporates here, either. Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is occasionally hilarious in his egocentricity ('my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions'), but mostly, he's just annoying. The Harry Potter fan club nonsense is annoying. Dobby is certainly annoying. Of the new characters, Lucius Malfoy makes for an excellent 'surface-level' villain, and it's nice to read more about the Weasleys; I especially like Mrs. Weasley. It would have been nice to have seen a little more clearly into Ginny's mind, considering the part she plays in the plot, but I suppose that would have been outside the compass of the narrative. This is still an engrossing read-I polished it off in half a day-but I would only recommend it on account of what precedes and follows it. It's still good ... just not as good."^3^May 30, 2011
silenceiseverything, ^659358^4^0^"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets seems to be the least favorite book of many HP fans. However, for many years The Chamber of Secrets was my second favorite book (this was before I read Deathly Hallows and followed my other favorite The Goblet of Fire). There's just something about it that's so captivating, a bit moreso than The Sorcerer's Stone. I think my love for The Chamber of Secrets stems from the fact that this is the first time we get an in-depth introduction to the elder Weasleys. In fact, I think the chapter where Harry goes to the Burrow might be my FAVORITE chapter out of all seven books (or at least my favorite 'fluffy' chapter). Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are just really great characters and so my love for that chapter knows no bounds. Of course, The Chamber of Secrets also holds my LEAST favorite chapter out of all seven books: Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party (I can totally see why it was excluded from the movie). It's just such a boring chapter. I do like St. Nicholas, but mostly in small increments. Devoting a whole chapter to him, though, is not my idea of fun. I also loved the whole rivalry between Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slythering. I found it fascinating how Slytherin only wanted 'pure' bloods in the school and didn't want any Muggle-borns in (there has to be some allegorical meaning behind THAT). Plus, I remember reading the line 'The Chamber of Secrets has now been opened. Enemies of the heir, BEWARE' and literally getting chills on my arm (I'm a bit weird that way). Oh and let's not forget the inclusion of two very lovable characters: Dobby and Gilderoy Lockheart. There's no need to go in to why Dobby is loveable (he's sweet, loyal, and he's so easy to sympathize with), but Lockheart needs a teeny bit of explaining. He's hilarious. That's it. That's the only reason why I love him. Sure he has a big head and thinks he's God's gift to the wizarding world, but again, he just has such fantastic one-liners ('celebrity is as celebrity does' and my personal favorite 'It's like magic!'). So, yes, I love Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It's always one of the books out of the series that I look most forward to reading. But, let's face it, I look forward to reading ALL of the Harry Potter series."^5^May 6, 2011
MidnightTears, ^659358^3^0^"Again, J. K. Rowling brings to life the wizarding world. Her writing matures to fit Harrys age here, and this is a plesant change. Once again Harry is trying to find his place in life, after meeting the one that has caused so much pain and suspecion at the end of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Ron and Hermione mature right along with Harry, and we find the three-some unraveling another mystery. This time, the person caught in the middle is a loved one! The end wraps up the storyline well, still leaving the reader waiting for the next book. I'll give this 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. The writing is still a bit young, the book still a slow read. However, there is a promise that Rowling might just be writing the books to reflect Harry's age. If so it will by lovely to watch this story evolve. I say, 'have faith, keep reading.'"^4^June 25, 2009
marialondon, ^659358^3^0^"It had to be five stars...because how else can you rate a book (or the whole series) when you can't seem to stop reading, from the moment the book starts until the last page...After finishing (in one sitting) the first book in the Harry Potter series, I ran out to buy number two, which I also read as quick as possible. The characters that I came to know & like in the first book were all there (Harry, Hagrid, Hermione & Ron), the humour was there, & of course the mystery was there...culminating in an interesting & unexpected ending. If I absolutely HAD to look for a flaw in book number two, the only thing I'd say is that it's not that different from book 1. And therefore it doesn't take you so much by surprise as the first one does. The third book in the series (The prisoner of Azkaban) is, I believe, much better than the first 2 books. But anyway: these are all details: the point is that the Harry Potter books are clear, pure fun & even if one is a little better or a little worse than the other, all in all, the four books (up till now) are all very worth reading."^5^June 30, 2009

But that doesn't mean that it's bad by any means. Harry is back at Hogwarts for his second year. There are things that I really liked about this book: I thought Tom Riddle's diary was pretty cool, I liked the further development of Dumbledore as a pretty cool guy and of Lucius as a pretty bad dude, I LOVE the Flying Ford Anglia. I don't so much like Dobby, what they find in the forest, or the new DADA professor. I got sick of Colin pretty quickly, and I didn't really enjoy the save-the-girl plot device used...well, both with Hermione AND Ginny. There's also a lot of self-flagellating in this book, both from Moaning Myrtle and Dobby. It got a bit old. But I digress. We get to learn more about Harry, the school, the Malfoy family, the Weasleys (oh, how I want to have a Burrow of my own!), Tom Riddle, the wizarding world: stigma of being a mudblood, what Mr. Weasley does, all that good stuff. I'm okay with this being a link between books one and three - and I am still looking forward to what comes next."^3^February 24, 2009

bjanecarp, ^659358^2^0^"Today I decided to review JK Rowling's second book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry Potter faces all the school things a muggle-born boy might only, of course, Of course, Harry is anything but normal. As an infant, his head is scarred by Voldemort's death curse, which nearly destroyed the Dark Lord. Now the boy is a twelve-year-0ld wizard in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this book, Rowling introduces a division in the wizarding world, between those who believe wizards should come from wizard-only ('pureblood') families, and people who accept the wizards from muggle-born parents. This concept forms the foundation for much of the plot for the next 6 novels. Lord Voldemort and his followers have done much over the years to impede muggle-borns (who they derisively call 'mudbloods') in every way possible. The followers and descendants of Salazar Slytherin are noted for their hatred of muggle-borns wizards. The crux of the matter is this: where does Harry belong? He was almost placed in Slytherin house. He is a Parselmouth, a wizard who can communicate with snakes, which is an extremely rare ability, noted as a gift possessed of Slytherin. Somewhere beneath halls of Hogwarts is the fabled Chamber of Secrets, guarded and unseen by Slytherin's monster. Harry, who knows little of of his own family, is terrified he is Slytherin's heir, and is suspected of initiating the attacks on muggle-born students throughout the school. Harry struggles with who he is, much as we do. Are we beings who are controlled by nature, or by the choices we make? At the height of Harry's self-doubt Dumbledore insists that 'only a true Griffindor could have pulled [Griffindor's sword] out of the hat.' Despite this, the story doesn't read as a morality tale. It is filled with action and, truth be told, reads more as a school whodunnit. The reader is constantly asking, 'Who is the Heir of Slytherin?' and 'Who or what is petrifying the students?' This in itself isn't a surprise. Plenty of other novels make the reader ask those questions. The difference is this: JK Rowling makes us care about the answers. The book is punctuated with humorous anecdotes of the eccentric Defense against the Dark Arts instructor, a few wild and gripping quidditch matches, and of course the grudge between Harry and his Slytherin-house nemesis, Draco Malfoy. Rowling's writing is, once again, taut. She seldom uses frivolous words and phrases. I particularly appreciate this of her. Nothing is discarded or throwaway in her writing. Forgotten characters from the series's first book resurface a half dozen novels later. A seemingly innocuous mention of a potion or spell at the beginning of a book proves to be extremely important later in the same story. It is appealing to me, both as a writer and a reader, to see how she is not frivolous with words, characters, and most especially, the Magical World she's created. That said, Her characters are pitch perfect. We remember what it's like to be twelve, and despise someone in school. We remember what it's like to have a best friend who's a girl, to whom we have no romantic consideration. We remember loving, and hating, and thinking too severe, any number of teachers. At that age, we notice girls with frizzy hair and large front teeth. We think puking up slugs is the height of comedy. Not only can Rowling write, but she has complete mastery over every situation in her novels. The only downside I can think of is the Scholastic (American) edition of the novels: I despise Mary Grandpré's art, and can hardly stomach these covers. As appealing as the novels are, I have to be honest: it's one time when the cover nearly made me judge the book. The Chamber of Secrets is not just for children. It's exemplary in every way. However, the cover made me think it was written for eight-year-olds. After seeing Grandpré's covers, I expected a novel that read in couplets like 'Humbledy bumbledy diggledy pum / Draco the Malfoy is silly and dumb.' Gods be thanked, I was wrong, and thrilled to admit how wrong I was... Kudos to her for an exemplary second novel. Of course, I've read the other five, and will review each in turn. Five stars of five."^5^September 22, 2011
pluckybamboo, ^659358^2^0^"For a long time this book was my favorite book of the series. The mystery slowly unravels and the new magic and characters make this book a wonderful installment in the series. It has an interesting and creative play on racism. Rowling brought the very present issue of not everyone being equal into her Harry Potter fantasy in a way that children and adults can really understand and appreciate. Certainly this novel is a little bit darker than the first, but it's not by much. And, after all, there has always been two sides, good and bad, black and white, to magic--and to life. So many elements of this story are relevant for today. Ginny's insecurities attending a new school, the feeling of not belonging due to circumstances beyond your control, loyaty to friends, issues of abandonment....they are all here in the Chamber of Secrets. The end of this book always made me want to jump out of my chair and cheer!"^5^June 11, 2009

This was the second year of Harry's adventures at Hogwarts school and the plot thickens as the pages are turned. Full of wonderful new characters and twists and turns. J.K Rowlings work has given young readers around the world a key to the joy of reading! My favorite part of the book was near the end when Harry and his friends figured out the ordeal behind the chamber of secrets and who was attacking the students at Hogwarts. Moaning Myrtle and her bathroom pathway and Harry's ability to beat 'Tom Riddle' aka Voldermort was clearly a demonstration of remarkable fantasy talent written by this author. Appropriate for all children who love to read and follow Harry in these wonderful tales!! Wonderful!! Can't wait to read the third and watch the movies:)"^5^May 31, 2011
bluejay5269113, ^659358^2^0^"in the second book of the Harry Potter series, the character Voldemort, or Tom Riddle, is greatly developed. in the beginning, the reader doesn't know that Lord Voldemort and Riddle are the same person, and you may even start to believe the Riddle is a protagonist, working for the greater good. but this round character will soon have you hating his guts, as he easily betrays Harry, and nearly kills Ginny. J.K. Rowling defiantly does a great job writing this character."^4^November 19, 2009
bardsfingertips, ^659358^2^0^"This was a fun read, very much like the first book only with a greater span on the introduction of characters and more of Harry Potter's past in relation of what-the-hell-is-going-on. I had one issue with this book, and this is a common thing new writers often suffer from. When writing, authors always want to improve on the previous novel. In this case, Rowling tried to expand on the number of events going on with Harry & his cohorts. The issue here is she tried to do that without expanding too much on the number of pages; so all of the scenes are shorter, choppier, and essentially rushed. As this is only her second publish book, this is not her fault. I have talked to other readers of the series, and they tend to agree with each other that this is the weakest book of the series and that it gets much better with the third. We shall see."^4^July 6, 2009
magemanda, ^659358^2^0^"Harry has had a miserable summer. None of his friends have written to him and he wonders whether Hogwarts and the world of wizardry that he discovered the year before is just a dream. Four weeks before he is due to return to school he has a visit from Dobby the House Elf who warns him away from returning to Hogwarts. And so we embark on another year at Hogwarts and another mystery - this time involving the Chamber of Secrets, of the title. I still thoroughly enjoyed this book, but not quite as much as the first. The main reason for this was the clumsy need to recap that Rowling displayed. The worst instance was when Colin and Harry are walking to the Quidditch pitch and Harry has to explain how it all works - it isn't completely unforgiveable since Colin has only just started at Hogwarts, but I felt it was superfluous nonetheless, and this was not the only instance. My other reason for the half star being dropped was Gilderoy Lockhart, a very tiresome character who boasts constantly about his achievements. I can see how some people might regard him as humourous but I begrudged any of his 'screentime' and wished he hadn't been introduced. In this book the fright factor is increased. There is a spine chilling scene in the Forbidden Forest, especially if you are not that fond of spiders, and I still have nerves when Harry faces off against Tom Riddle and he reveals who he actually is. Some younger readers might well be scared by some of the moments in this story. Once again, the characters are fleshed out fantastically, even minor characters such as Lee Jordan (who commentates the Quidditch matches in a very entertaining manner). All of them are extremely memorable and, even in just this second book of the series, very familiar to the reader. It is a tribute to Rowling's writing of these characters that I never mix up my Professor Sprout with my Professor Flitwick - each of the people who roam the wizarding world have their own characteristics and personalities. The little details also charmed me. I love the fact that the students have to turn in essays of a certain length in inches on their rolled parchment, rather than word count or pages. I enjoy the Dickensian element of the story - the quills for writing, the clothes and robes. The descriptions of the feasts are unbelievable - they make you wish you could be transported to eat there. This is not my favourite of the seven in the series for reasons detailed above, but it is still a great read!"^5^October 5, 2009
crazy4reading, ^659358^1^0^"I love the Harry Potter books and decided to re-read them all since the very last movie was released. I hope to finish them all by the end of this year (2011). I still enjoy this book after reading it for the 5th time or more. The Chamber of Secrets is where we meet many more characters such as Ginny, Colin, Gilderoy Lockhart and more. You learn about phoenixes and their wonderful loyalty and abilities. You also learn more about Lord Voldemort and exactly who he is. This is who Harry meets in the Chamber of Secrets, when he goes to rescue Ginny Weasley. I still find myself comparing the book to the movie even now. Somethings I enjoyed being added to the movie and somethings I missed not being in the movie. I know I will be reading these books for years to come."^4^August 30, 2011
D.Holliman, ^659358^1^0^"What I love about Harry Potter is that it pulls readers instantly into a world that is not unlike their own, yet it has this fantastical element to it. Rowling takes ordinary things like banks, shops, and schools and turns them into magical and wondrous places. Every book in the series ends with you wanting to read the next book in the series. She uses Harry as the reader's guide in asking questions and helping us learn not only what they are in the muggle world, but also what it is in the magical realm. This book does an excellent job discussing vanity, racism, and how our choices reflect who we truly are. Rowling really ties her themes together so that you can't really discuss one of them without discussing the others. Yet it does it in a way that is still interesting and escapist."^5^June 8, 2009
Theamwriter, ^659358^1^0^"This is the second book in the Harry Potter series. I just love the world that J.K. Rowling has created for this series.

In this book, Harry Potter is in his second year at Hogwarts and he finds that he has the ability to talk to snakes (due to a connection with Voldemort). In this book Harry Potter and his friends must figure out who or what is petrifying all of the students one by one. In the end he must save Ron's little sister Ginny from the Basilisk, and Tom Riddle. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who read the first Harry Potter book and who likes witches, wizards and magic in their stories."^5^May 6, 2011

unlikelyaristotle, ^659358^1^0^"This was my favorite Harry Potter book. I'm truly sad that the series are over. There will only ever be seven Harry Potter books!!! Rowling has a wonderful knack for storytelling. I love how everything seems so impossibly mysterious at the beginning, and it all ties in at the end. One thing I always wondered about the wizarding world was why would they celebrate Christmas? Lol, I don't know why I just assumed witches and wizards would be Wiccans instead and follow more wiccan rituals? Hmmm... In any case, I just love the trio: Harry, Hermione and Ron, I love the strong friendship that holds them together. And of course Dobby the house-elf!! Such a cute and sometimes infuriating little creature! I have a strong feeling that these books in the years to come is going to create cults like the LOTR ones!!! I'd join :-D"^5^August 17, 2009

jamesgeiselhofer, ^659358^1^0^"In harry potter and the chamber of secrets, harry is back and ready for his second year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Shortly after Harry gets there people are getting paralyzed. This could only mean one thing; the chamber of secrets has been opened. Harry is the only one who speaks parlestongue so he must be the heir of slyterin who made this chamber and only his heir can open it. Harry goes to the chamber after Ron's sister Ginny is taken and defeats a balsik, and tom riddle aka lord Voldemort. Harry has save Hogwarts. This book was really good. It deserves 5 out of 5 stars. The story-line was interesting and kept you hooked till the end."^4^October 19, 2010
AwXomeMan, ^659358^1^0^"The second adventure for our hero Harry Potter. This one lets us learn a little more about Voldemort's past. The Chamber of Secrets is opened and students are being attacked by something within it. Apparently the heir of Slytherin has returned and opened the Chamber. Harry and his friends must find out who the heir is and stop them from attacking students before it's too late. Although this is the second book in the series it was actually the first one I ever read. This is the book that got me into the series in the first place. Just as with the first book in the series I would give this book to any children who have started reading chapter books."^5^December 11, 2009

SanoChi, ^659358^1^0^"Harry Potter, the golden boy in Hogwarts, is accused of trying to kill people. Through the darker sequel from the series first book, Harry goes through another school year, breaking many rules, to try and clear his name. This book goes back to the first book way too much, giving a paragraph or two every ten pages or so saying who someone is, as if no one read the first book before. Nothing new is really added either. A couple new students and a secret room. That's more or less about it. Not the best book in the series, but still worth reading if you want to read the series."^4^May 8, 2010

harpua, ^659358^1^0^"I enjoyed Chamber of Secrets much more than the first Harry Potter novel. I had already seen the movie (many times I'm sure as my kids love the Harry Potter films) so I knew the basic plot and I don't think that the movie drifted too far from the novel. There may have been a few minor things in the books that you didn't see in the movie, but to be honest, I really can't name one. The pacing on this one improved immensely from the first novel and this one was hard to put down. If I was new to the Harry Potter world, the first book may have kept me from reading further, but this would keep me moving on."^4^August 22, 2009
beckykolacki, ^659358^1^0^"The second book was quite scary the first time I read it, at age 12. The monster in this book is very frightening, and this isn't just a kid's novel.

Professor Gilderoy Lockhart has me laughing out loud at almost every he says, no matter how many times I read this book."^5^October 2, 2010

Just before it was time for Harry to return back to Hogwarts, Harry met a house elf named Doby. Doby warned Harry Potter not to go back to Hogwarts because something bad would happen to him. After Doby's warning a series of bad things did begin happening to Harry and other students at Hogwarts. Students start getting attacked in the Castle and unless Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, can find out how to stop the attacks then Hogwarts will be closed down forever."^5^January 22, 2011
jessilouwho22, ^659358^1^0^"I remember thinking before I read this book that it was my least favorite out of the series (of the ones that I've read). I take that back. I won't say that it's my favorite (it isn't), but I still love it and find it very important to the development of the series. I still loved diving into the world of Harry Potter, and I was completely captivated, once again, by Harry's adventures. One of the parts that I particularly enjoy about this book is that we find out that Harry Potter can, in fact, get into trouble and that he isn't as invincible as some people in the wizarding world think. That's not to say that he's not my favorite character out of the book, but J.K. Rowling uses this as a smart move to present her main character with a character flaw--therefore making the story all the more believable. This is one of her strengths in writing these novels. Even though they are works of fiction, she makes it so that readers can actually believe that something of this sort can happen. Another wise move on J.K. Rowling's part, specifically in this book more so than the first book, is that this is where the reader gets to see just how evil Voldemort/Tom Riddle is and the chaos and pandemonium he can reek. Whereas before the reader only heard about horrors he committed in the past, we are able to see in this book that he is still very much a potent threat. One other very important component of this book is the discrimination between pure-blood families, half-blood families and Muggle-borns. Particularly on the part of the Malfoys, we see people who are very racist, if you will. Rowling makes this a very clear part of this novel, making me wonder if it comes into play in future books. The only thing that I have to complain about with this novel is the fact that she reiterates a lot of points from the first book, making it so that you almost don't have to read the first book. I really shouldn't complain about it because it's probably something that she had to do in writing a sequel, but it did get on my nerves sometimes. On a side note, one of the things I absolutely love about all of these books is that they are, in a way, like solving a giant puzzle. There have been countless times while reading these books that I end up smacking myself in the head, thinking, 'Why didn't I think of that?' or 'Why didn't I pick up on that?'"^5^July 28, 2010
jyasinchuk, ^659358^1^0^"A favourite in the Potter series. The reason is probably because we learn more about He Who Shall Not Be Named--Lord Voldemort--he is no longer just an evil individual, but a wizard with links to Hogwarts, Harry, his parents, and the future of the wizards' world. Once again, Rowling's ability to describe and hold you captive for the duration is truly astounding! Har-ry! Har-ry!"^5^July 13, 2010
dbhutch, ^659358^1^0^"Year two with our friend Harry Potter. I have read all of these several times before now, but have just read all of them in a row now that the last movie of the set is out, and seen. So many differences in the movies and the books, they make each like its own different adventure. The Chamber of Secrets, with its background on more of the Dursleys and more Quidditch than was ever in the movies captures the reader with fascination. Favorite character from book two - again - McGonagall."^5^July 31, 2011

beckylynn, ^659358^1^0^"In Chamber of Secrets is where the Harry Potter fan get's to first meet Voldemort on more serious and intimate terms. I found that I actually like this book better than the first and third in the series. Harry is always the center of attention, and always finding himself in desperate situations, and this book is no exception to that rule. If your reading the series,this book is absolutely neccesary to read to understand things later on. "^5^March 2, 2011
REGoodrich, ^659358^1^0^"Another fun book full of imagination and unexpected surprises. The characters, though many, are easy to keep track of given each has his or her own unique, notable quirks.

ctmsmihet, ^659358^1^0^"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the creative sequel to Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone. Inside the magic filled book, Harry and his friends (Ron and Hermione) return to Hogwarts and continue their wizarding studies. While in Hogwarts Harry finds that the legendary Chamber of Secrets has been opened by the heir of Slytherin. Harry has to find who the heir of Slytherin is while being suspected as the heir himself. I really enjoy reading the Harry Potter books because when I read them I feel like I am inside this fantasy world, that's full of imagination of all sorts. J.K. Rowling really gets the readers sucked into her books, and she writes so good that I hardly ever want to put the book down. Another thing I really liked about The Chamber of Secrets was that, the ending wasn't predictable or obvious or anything. It was kind of like a big mystery, so you didn't know who did it or why, all you knew was everything that Harry knew when he was investigating, you didn't all ready know who did it. I have rated this book five stars because the writing was really good, and the whole story line grabbed your attention. I really tried to read this book anytime that I could because I needed to know what happened."^5^December 11, 2011
reading_fox, ^659358^1^0^"My least favourite of the series. There is a plot on Harry's life so the exceptionally annoying Dobby the house Elf trys to prevent Harry from attending Hogwarts. Harry does eventually make it there only to discover something is attacking the students. It appears that similar attacks happened 50 years ago - involving a decendant of the ancient and powerfull wizard Slytherin, and a hidden room (one of many) in the castle called The Chamber of Secrets. The style is much the same as the first book - a year condensed into a short book, with more background emerging about a few of the pupils and teachers - but considering the class sizes not much more about other students. Although the imagery describes largish classes only a few students gain even a name. Don't know why I dislike this book mor ethan the others but something just seems off slightly in it. The plot is very rushed in a few places and Locheart is truly annoying. Maybe Rowling's greatest skillis in deliberately writing annoying characters."^3^July 28, 2008

Trouble follows Harry as he learns of a magic chamber in Hogwarts that houses a monster that is paralyzing students. On top of that, Harry is hearing voices, and his enemy, Draco Malfoy, is as nasty as ever. Can Harry stop Hogwarts from closing due to the danger? Only with the help of his friends!

djhurley92, ^659358^1^0^"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is even more exciting as the first book. The school year hasn't even started for Harry and he finds himself locked in his room because of magic and he wasn't the cause of it. It is nice that Ron and his brothers free him but they to get in trouble for messing in others affairs. But when Harry gets on shcool grounds his troubles get a lot worse. Harry must endure living trees that might smash you in one hit and giant spiders that want to eat him alive. But Harry's problems don't stop there. If he thought giant spiders and smashing trees were a problem than he hasn't faced anything yet. I believe that this book is a very thriller. I would reccomend it to anyone."^4^May 10, 2009

He has had no contact with his best friends Ron and Hermione and he is beginning to wonder if both his school and his friends were nothing but a dream. When a house elf named Dobby shows up in his bedroom and wreaks havoc, the Dursleys lock Harry in his room with the promise that he will never be let out. His future looks dim, but then Ron and his brothers Fred and George appear outside Harry's window one night in a flying car and whisk him off to their home, the Burrow, where Harry gladly spends the remainder of his summer holiday. In Diagon Alley they meet their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher - the unbelievably vain Gilderoy Lockhart. The school year doesn't start off any better than his summer did, as the barrier to Platform 9 3/4 seals itself against Harry and Ron, preventing them from boarding the Hogwarts Express. They get into loads of trouble when they decide to fly Mr. Weasley's car to school, instead - they are almost expelled, they get detention, and Ron receives a Howler from his mother. Everything seems to go downhill from there - Harry starts hearing an evil voice that no one else can hear; everyone learns he can talk to snakes; their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is a joke; Ron's wand, broken when their car crash-landed into the Whomping Willow, wreaks havoc with every spell he attempts; Draco Malfoy is the new Slytherin Seeker and the whole team has brand new, lightening-fast broomsticks; and worse of all, a new and seemingly deadly enemy appears in their midst - the mysterious Chamber of Secrets has been opened and students are being petrified left and right. While everyone else thinks Harry is the Heir of Slytherin, it is up to him, Ron, and Hermione to figure out who it really is before it's too late."^5^July 2, 2009
readafew, ^659358^1^0^"This is the second of seven books about a boy called Harry Potter, living with his Aunt, Uncle and cousin Dudley who make life rather awful. On his 11th birthday he learned a wonderful secret, he's a wizard, and started school at Hogwarts. We follow Harry as he makes friends and enemies and learns a little bit about magic. After the his first school year was over Harry was sent back to his Aunt and Uncles for the summer holidays, much to his displeasure. After a couple months not hearing anything from ANY of his friends Harry is really depressed and the only thing keeping him going is the thought of going back to Hogwarts. A house elf has decided that to keep Harry Potter safe he needs to prevent Harry from going to Hogwarts and so tries many schemes to keep Harry from returning, much to Harry's horror and worry. Once again Harry will have to face a problem caused by Lord Voldemort and try to save his friends and even Hogwarts itself! Will he be up to the task?

nelsonmendes, ^659358^1^0^"The previous book concludes the first year at Hogwarts, the second book (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) opens up the whole new second year. The book is hard to put down; you can relatively complete the book in a day, that's if you just read! This is a book that everyone would be able to read, and I don't like reading but somehow this series of books really appeals to me. The series gets more mature each and every book. Now the book begins like normal, getting the books from the wizard's shopping centre. And everyone meets up there before departing from their families and returning to Hogwarts for Witchcraft and Wizardry, or for the first time if it's your first year at Hogwarts. Well one thing has changed, well really two, everyone has moved up a year and the chamber of secrets has been opened for the first time in 50 years. Everyone is scared that people are going to get killed, like the previous time it was opened. They suspect it is the heir of Slytherin. When Harry is always first to arrive at the scene of the crime, they suspect it is him and everyone keeps their distance from him. Harry starts to hear voices, he confronts his friends, they both think this is strangely odd and to confront Professor McGonagall about his problem. Harry never does confront her, harry finds it strangely odd that he can speak parcel tongue (can talk to snakes). Only people that are the descendents of Slytherin house can talk to snakes, at the end of the book Processor Dumbledore tells harry that instead of Voldemort killing him, he accidently gave him some of his powers. Like in every ending of a fantasy novel, Harry saves the day and Gryffindor win the house cup because of him. I don't want to ruin the book for future readers so I left out the main spoilers. Highly recommended series, even though I haven't read them all I know they will all be great. (Word count: 341)"^4^March 24, 2011
Fivezenses, ^659358^1^0^"The story starts off with Harry stuck at the Dursley's house and for his birthday. They get so mad at the boy they lock him away in this room for the rest of the summer. I know, crazy right? But of course Ron comes to the rescue for Harry and they go back to the Wesley household. From there on out the Harry, Ron, and Hermione start another fabulous adventure, all the while learning about some of the past. The key to want will become information in how 'thou shall not be named' makes his return! I read this book over 10 years ago. I have yet to re-read it but that is one of my goals in the next six months; to re-read the entire first four books of the series and try to finish the 5th one as well. I never read the last two, but I heard they are amazing! One good reason for my to dive right back into the wonderful series. Anyway, I was just a 'tween' when I started the series back in 1999. I ate up the first one faster than I've ever read anything in my entire life! The 2nd book didn't stand a chance when my mother bought it for me. The way the story makes you feel, as though you are really there, immersed in this magical world. It's a priceless piece of imagination that no other series has done in the last 20+ years for children and everyone else of all ages. I'd recommend this book, of course, to those that read the first book. But also to those that haven't read the first two. I'd give them both to someone who loves the read and take a truly amazing journey with books. J.K. Rowling is simply a visionary in story telling. I wish she would maybe write a pre-quel to the books about maybe how things began or how Harry's parents were as teenagers at Hogwarts. I think that other fans of the series would love that too, mostly due to the fact that on 'Pottermore' she explains some backstory information. Some of that included that his Aunt Petunia, she is Harry's mother's Sister, which meant she is a witch herself! She denied her magical side and well ended up marring Veron, a muggle, and had a very boring life. This means his cousin Dudley is half muggle and doesn't know about it. Things like that could make a very lovely story! But alas Rowling doesn't want to write anymore of the 'Harry Potter' world. So in conclusion, if you haven't read the series, you may want to or wait, because next year for the first time ever, the eBooks will be available. So no matter how you decide to read it, this series isn't one to miss, especially this one from the series!"^4^March 1, 2012

justabookreader, ^659358^1^0^"Ah, the second book in my Harry Potter re-read this summer and what a wonderful story this one is. OK, I'll probably say that about all of them so get over it now. Before I forget to mention it, there will be a number of spoilers in this one so stop reading now if you prefer not to know. The short re-cap of this installment --- Harry joins Ron and Hermione for their second year at Hogwarts. Harry finds out he's a parseltongue (he can talk to snakes) and starts to hear voices, student turn up petrified, and the Chamber of Secrets is rumored to have been opened by the heir of Slytherin. Flying cars, the Whomping Willow, and Dobby the house elf. Dobby is probably one of my favorite characters, just below Ginny Weasley. When he died in book seven, I was so upset, maybe even more upset than when Dumbledore died because I wasn't expecting it. He's amusing, sort of pathetic, and shows you just how awful the Malfoy's are as a family. It's not just Draco, it's all of them. We learn more about Hagrid and we get to see how nasty some of the creatures are that he loves so dearly. I'm with Ron all that way on this one; I prefer the dragon to the gargantuan sized spiders. They are way too creepy, crawly, and there is something very disturbing about all those all those eyes looking back at you. Ginny joins the rest of the Weasley clan at school in year two and I love her shyness and the crush she has on Harry. It's so cute. Still hating Snape as I expected to. Nasty, mean, greasy, undermining --- I have nothing nice to say about him and that will not be changing. I know what's coming and re-reading makes me dislike him ever more than ever. The Weasley twins set off more fireworks in this one and it's nice to see their future in humor retail emerging. Such talent these two boys have for destruction but it's all in good fun and someone has to be the comic relief. Details, details, details. Rowling does such a great job of putting so many tiny hints in these books. First, the idea that Harry can talk to snakes appears in the Sorcerer's Stone when he unleashes the snake at the zoo and now it's explained even further here by Dumbledore when he tells Harry that part of Voldermort's power was transferred to Harry when he attacked him. What I like even more is that it's left out there for us to wonder what will happen with that bit of information later. I also like the mention of werewolves in this one preparing us for a new professor in book three which I will tell you now is my favorite. :) Not having read these early books in such a long time makes me very happy to be doing so now. They are a treat to read and a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. I can easily classify this series as a comfort read."^5^August 18, 2010

They get into loads of trouble when they decide to fly Mr. Weasley's car to school, instead - they are almost expelled, they get detention, and Ron receives a Howler from his mother. Everything seems to go downhill from there - Harry starts hearing an evil voice that no one else can hear; everyone learns he can talk to snakes; their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is a joke; Ron's wand, broken when their car crash-landed into the Whomping Willow, wreaks havoc with every spell he attempts; Draco Malfoy is the new Slytherin Seeker and the whole team has brand new, lightening-fast broomsticks; and worse of all, a new and seemingly deadly enemy appears in their midst - the mysterious Chamber of Secrets has been opened and students are being petrified left and right. While everyone else thinks Harry is the Heir of Slytherin, it is up to him, Ron, and Hermione to figure out who it really is before it's too late."^5^July 2, 2009
justabookreader, ^659358^1^0^"Ah, the second book in my Harry Potter re-read this summer and what a wonderful story this one is. OK, I'll probably say that about all of them so get over it now. Before I forget to mention it, there will be a number of spoilers in this one so stop reading now if you prefer not to know. The short re-cap of this installment --- Harry joins Ron and Hermione for their second year at Hogwarts. Harry finds out he's a parseltongue (he can talk to snakes) and starts to hear voices, student turn up petrified, and the Chamber of Secrets is rumored to have been opened by the heir of Slytherin. Flying cars, the Whomping Willow, and Dobby the house elf. Dobby is probably one of my favorite characters, just below Ginny Weasley. When he died in book seven, I was so upset, maybe even more upset than when Dumbledore died because I wasn't expecting it. He's amusing, sort of pathetic, and shows you just how awful the Malfoy's are as a family. It's not just Draco, it's all of them. We learn more about Hagrid and we get to see how nasty some of the creatures are that he loves so dearly. I'm with Ron all that way on this one; I prefer the dragon to the gargantuan sized spiders. They are way too creepy, crawly, and there is something very disturbing about all those all those eyes looking back at you. Ginny joins the rest of the Weasley clan at school in year two and I love her shyness and the crush she has on Harry. It's so cute. Still hating Snape as I expected to. Nasty, mean, greasy, undermining --- I have nothing nice to say about him and that will not be changing. I know what's coming and re-reading makes me dislike him ever more than ever. The Weasley twins set off more fireworks in this one and it's nice to see their future in humor retail emerging. Such talent these two boys have for destruction but it's all in good fun and someone has to be the comic relief. Details, details, details. Rowling does such a great job of putting so many tiny hints in these books. First, the idea that Harry can talk to snakes appears in the Sorcerer's Stone when he unleashes the snake at the zoo and now it's explained even further here by Dumbledore when he tells Harry that part of Voldermort's power was transferred to Harry when he attacked him. What I like even more is that it's left out there for us to wonder what will happen with that bit of information later. I also like the mention of werewolves in this one preparing us for a new professor in book three which I will tell you now is my favorite. :) Not having read these early books in such a long time makes me very happy to be doing so now. They are a treat to read and a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. I can easily classify this series as a comfort read."^5^August 18, 2010
Laura_Jean, ^659358^1^0^"I love this book series! I was reading this book at the lake and I almost had to stop because it was frightening to a 12-year old, but I kept going because I couldn't put it down. Rowling does some of her best work in this book."^5^July 6, 2011
bookworm12, ^659358^1^0^"Harry Potter enters his second year at Hogwarts with a bang... literally. He crashes into a tree while flying a car to school. The second book in the series has never been my favorite, but I was surprised, upon re-reading it, to discover how many small details foreshadow events in future books. They seem unimportant here, but in retrospect Rowling was clearly setting up the final premise early on. There are also so many important characters that are introduced in this installment. We meet Dobby and see his eternal loyalty unfold from the first chapters. We meet the entire Weasley family (except the eldest brothers) and visit their home, the Burrow, for the first time. They truly become Harry's family and so this is an important event. We also see Dumbledore's office for the first time and his role becomes more prominent. This is also the book where Voldemort becomes more than just a generic baddie. Until now we knew nothing about his past. Learning about his heritage, childhood and 'normal' years makes him an interesting adversary, instead of just a villain. I love Harry's struggle with the similarities between him and his foe. It adds another great layer to the story. Rowling has an interesting habit of splitting up the core group at the end of many of the books. In the first one, Ron is separated from Hermione and Harry at the chess game. In the second book, Hermione is debilitated before the Chamber of Secrets sequence. In the third book, Ron is again out of commission before the final section. I never really noticed that before, but it's an interesting trend. Side note: What happened to Neville? He is barely mentioned at all in this book, which is sad. A few things I'd forgotten about the second book: 1) This is the first time Harry is really disliked or feared by other students. In future books this happens frequently, but this book marks the first time Harry is rejected by many of the people he knows in the wizarding world. 2) I'd forgotten all about Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party. It provides a chance to meet a few of the house ghosts, which is important in the final books. 3) Fawkes is such a critical character in this book. I'd forgotten how crucial the phoenix's role is and how important it is that he comes when Harry needs him. It speaks volumes about Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore at a time when Harry didn't know him well."^5^February 18, 2011
harpua, ^659358^1^0^"I enjoyed Chamber of Secrets much more than the first Harry Potter novel. I had already seen the movie (many times I'm sure as my kids love the Harry Potter films) so I knew the basic plot and I don't think that the movie drifted too far from the novel. There may have been a few minor things in the books that you didn't see in the movie, but to be honest, I really can't name one. The pacing on this one improved immensely from the first novel and this one was hard to put down. If I was new to the Harry Potter world, the first book may have kept me from reading further, but this would keep me moving on."^4^August 22, 2009
tjsjohanna, ^659358^1^0^"This installment provides more details about life under the reign of Lord Voldemort - and more information about the dark wizard's early beginnings. Things I enjoyed this time reading: watching how the friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermoine solidifies as they work together. Seeing Harry learn that it isn't so much what you are fated for as what you choose (a theme that continues to be important throughout the series). I always wish Harry would confide more in Dumbledore (though he might not give Harry straight answers) and then I think, maybe Dumbledore wants him to figure things out because he knows Harry needs the experience and first hand knowledge. But surely with Harry's clues, Dumbledore would have know what the monster in the Chamber of Secrets was ..."^5^August 3, 2010

I love all the characters in the books, even the Malfoys and Voldemort himself. She's a fantastic story teller and I look forward to reading it again with my younger boy. A series of books that can be enjoyed by all ages."^5^November 12, 2010
JechtShot, ^659358^1^0^"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened... again! The second book in the Harry Potter series continues to develop the characters first introduced in 'The Sorcerer's Stone'. In Harry's second year at Hogwarts he encounters something that is threatening to close the school and kill the students. Naturally, Harry's inner hero comes to the plate as he faces the next challenge. In this novel, J.K. Rowling adds a few more faces to the cast of characters in the 'Potterverse': Tom Riddle, Dobby, Lucius Malfoy, Gilderoy Lockhart and many others. If you have not read this series you are missing out. This book provides significant foreshadowing on the books to come, but I will stop that thought there to avoid spoiling one of the greatest fantasy series' ever conceived."^4^January 4, 2010
brandon.brown1, ^659358^1^0^"This book is about a boy named Harry. Harry is going to his second school year at Hogwarts. Harry is spending the summer with his family and can not wait to see his friends at school. Harry is tries to be stopped from going to school by a thing named Dobby. Harry does not listen and his friends help him to get Hogwarts. Harry is then finds himself trying to get into the Chamber of Secrets. Harry then killed a giant snake who was a young Lord Voldemort and saved the school. That is was the book is about. I gave this book a five star rating because i thought this book was very good. I found the book to be exciting. I found this book to be interesting. I like the main character Harry. I liked the the book sequels. I like the books storyline. That is why i gave this book a five star rating."^5^May 31, 2012
RebeccaAnn, ^659358^1^0^"Warning: This review contains spoilers. Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry provides us with even more excitement and adventure than his first! Though the Harry Potter series is most definitely a children's/young adult's book, the second one has much darker overtones than the first. Muggleborns are mysteriously being Petrified at Hogwarts and unless the culprit is found, there's a good chance Hogwarts will close...for good because for every student ending up Petrified, the odds are getting higher and higher that soon enough, one will end up murdered. Harry also begins to exhibit a few traits associated with Dark Magic, most notably his being a Parselmouth. Could it be possible that he's the Heir of Slytherin who's responsible for Petrifying innocent students? Overall, I've always felt this book had more pure adventure and less emotional angst and whatnot than most of the other books. We see Harry develop some more on-the-spot problem solving skills as he must eventually enter the Chamber and fight the monster, and we definitely see his bravery even in the face of what appears to be insurmountable odds. However, I must say that while this book is just as much fun to read as the first in the series, it is by no means my favorite. Yes, it's packed with action and adventure, but it seems to be the book least relevant to the culmination of the series. I'm not disregarding the importance of Riddle's diary, but we are never told the importance of it until the sixth book so it seems to have little to no relevance to the series while reading it. There's also the lack of emotional connectivity in this book. There wasn't a good balance between the adventure and the emotional side of things, I thought. There was too much mystery and excitement and not enough self-discovery. This might not bother some people, but it's always bothered me (for what I always felt was an excellent balance, think of the third, fourth, and fifth Harry Potter books). Still, it's an excellent book and I love it and I love to reread it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it and if you have read it, well I always think it's worth a reread!"^5^June 14, 2009

It amazes me that this book is almost as old as I am, is of course considered a very popular classic, and yet - I never read it until I was an adult! Given its age, I'm sure everybody *else* here knows the plot, but just in case, this is a book about a (very logical, I'm sure) series of misadventures that happens after you give something to a mouse. Every request leads to another thing, and another, and another, until the poor boy in the story falls dead asleep. This book is too cute, and it's funny, too, in a way that both adults and kids will appreciate.

Peep, ^5950492^1^4^"I picked up this book with the full knowledge that I have a 'fixed' mindset (I'm driven by achievement, rewards, and external praise) and wanting to get some insight on how to change that. This book gives endless examples of the 'fixed' mindset and how that lead the person or organization to failure (some of the examples are actually quite successful), and endless examples of the 'growth' mindset, and how having that particular mindset lead the person or organization to greater success.

Great! I'm on board with this whole 'mindset' modality. Let's get started and do the hard work to fix that! Unfortunately this book does not give you anything except for page after page after page of anecdotes. Seriously. That's it.

micnava15, ^22556011^6^0^"When I first heard of the Hunger Games, I had no interest at all. I wasn't like most bandwagoners that automatically tagged along with the book and eventually the movie. I starting reading the first book, just becuase of an indepedent reading project I was assigned in my english class. I ended up enjoying it and I got with the Hunger Games flow. As my final independent reading project, I decided to choose the second book, Catching Fire becuase of my experience with the first book.
In Catching Fire, Suzanne gives you a different aspect of Hunger Games, and Pamen. After Victors, Katniss and Peeta return back home, they belive that chaos is over, and that the games are done for now. The next obstacles they face are the threats announced by President Snow. You have a different seat in all the action, no longer on the Hunger Games fields, but in the districts. Catching Fire is packed with suspense and action, and a bit of romance confusion. At the end, you'll always find yourself at the edge of your seat, waiting to turn to the next page of this incredible adventure.
I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interest in fiction, fantasy, or anyone who has the Hunger Games crave. I would also highly recommend reading the book series before watching the movie, and the upcoming one for the second book. I am looking forward into reading the third and final book, MockingJay."^4^May 29, 2013

Luckyfield6, ^455077^5^0^"My son misplaced the school library's copy of Fox in Socks and wanted me to replace it. After shopping around on numerous sites, I found Walmart to provide the lowest price for this book (including sales tax and delivery). It arrived within 2 days of placing the order. The school is now happy and I too am happy. Thank you, Walmart!"^5^May 14, 2010

nanasopinion, ^212493^8^2^"This book was given to me as a gift by an aunt (who collects childrens books) when my sons were in their teens. I was missing my sons terribly and a great deal of what I was missing was the years that had gone by. Some how the silly extreamnes of the story made feel better. I have bought the book twice now as gifts. A beautiful little story-my favorites line is 'love you forever and like you for always...'"^5^December 10, 2009
lilmanbandbearsmom, ^212493^4^0^"I love reading this book to my boys. I like it so much that I buy it for my friends when they have new babies. This copy was for a co-worker. I told him I got him a book to read to his new baby and he said - 'My mom use to read me this book and it said 'Love you forever, like you for always'.
When I told him that was the same book I got, he was really excited that he would be reading his little girl the same book that his mom had read to him."^5^September 6, 2011

BabyPsMommy, ^5076319^0^1^"My husband and I are expecting our first child in November, and when I read the title of this book, I had to get it for him for Father's Day. We have dreamed for so long about the day/night that our child will be born, and we know that it will be the happiest day of our lives, filled with a joy we can't describe. I wanted a book to express that joy to our child, but in a way that a small child would understand. This book does just that. It captures the joy of the night of a child's birth, and makes the child feel special, loved, and wanted. Lines in the book tell of the moon celebrating the child's birth, animals dancing and rejoicing, and even angels in heaven playing horns to celebrate the birth of the child. It really expresses to the child that they are unique. We plan to start a tradition of reading this book to our child from birth on. Its a very special book!"^5^June 24, 2011
