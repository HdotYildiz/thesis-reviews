WestKY, ^42359080^12^4^"This is a great series, of course. Most reviews for this product concern the format. The series has been produced in a double sided disc format, with poor reviews for quality. These are NOT double sided discs. I have no problem with playback in my blue ray player, and the quality is fine. Would highly recommend this product."^5^March 2, 2016

lindseyb, ^4125897^15^0^"You won't be able to put this book down. Astonishing stories lurk around the turn of each page; you won't be able to stop until you know what happens next. Jeannette Walls is an amazing writer with an even more thrilling and amazing story. This book is uplifting and inspiring. The story had depth, growth and left absolutely nothing out. It brought me to places unimaginable and I hope one day I will be able to travel to some of them.
The Glass Castle had everything from crazy family members to family members who just want to get out and forget. Growing up was an experience to be had, both amazing and difficult for the children in this novel. For example the neurotic father in the story takes his children to pet untamed lions and made them travel up and down the western US with no idea of a stable home. The reader really feels a part of the story and there are times where you will want to reach into the book and save these children. You will be shocked, warmed, dumbfounded, and enraptured by this book. It's amazing how strong people can really be and the lives that each of us lead can be so much deeper than we imagine.
I would advise young readers to stay away from this book, because some of the scenes can be quite graphic, and the language is bad. I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults who are looking for a captivating read, which will keep you thinking all the way through.
Read this book."^5^May 16, 2009
mysweetadrina, ^4125897^4^2^"This is a true story or so we are told and it doesn't really matter to me one way or the other. It's a fantastic read! Jeanette the narrator goes through her life which is mainly hardships without trying to gain sympathy but more as sharing her story and getting it out in the open. Although, very wealthy, her family grew up in poverty due to parents that were mentally unstable and not capable of giving their children the care they needed. The children raised above their parents faults every time and drew closer to each other until they were able to go out on their own. One could consider that some of this is 'creative licensing' but so what? It was still fun to read. I think the only thing that bothered me about the book is that the author didn't take any of the good from her parents (there wasn't much so this would have been difficult) and never showed previous signs of really wanting to escape the philosophy's of her parents but just to escape the physical hardships. Definitely worth your time."^5^June 4, 2008
Im4Him, ^4125897^4^0^"The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls must have been very difficult for her to write. Talk about a dysfunctional family! The children had a very rough upbringing since they mostly did that for themselves, but probably because of that they grew into strong adults! I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to others. Some things were hard to read because you realize that this was a real family, not fiction."^4^July 21, 2008
Lovetoread789, ^4125897^4^0^"This book was hard to put down and was one of the best books I have ever read. It was hard to believe that the author had endured so many hardships as a young child right here in the United States. The author does an excellent job of telling her story and it is hard to stop thinking about it long after you finish reading her true life story. I would say it is a 'must read'."^5^December 7, 2009
^4125897^4^0^"This is a great book. The parents of the author are unusual parents. You would expect the writer to be angry with their lackadaisical life style. Just when you think they have hit bottom, something worse comes along. This is a book you can't put down."^5^November 12, 2010

TvThemeFan, ^4125897^2^0^"And I agree! I chose to read this book for a summer AP Lang essay. Along with this and the Handmaid's Tale I was able to really broaden my reading 'Horizon' if you would say. After reading Mrs. Walls' book I was amazed at some of the things I read in her memoir including the part when she and her brother had to eat out of the dumpster in order to be fed... that broke my heart and left me dumbfounded that such things do ACTUALLY go on not only in this world but in this country. This book has made me look at life differently as a teenager. By that, I mean it has made me be more appreciative of my upbringing and be thankful for every little thing in my life even if it's not what I would've signed up for. I've realized that there will always be a time in everyone's life when you will be better off than someone else.. so be thankful for what you've got and to help you with that please read this book :)"^5^July 8, 2012

kea07, ^4125897^2^0^"This is such a wonderful book. It is hard to believe the hardships Jeannette Walls has overcome to become the lady she is today. You won't be able to put this book down! It is very touching, one you won't soon forget!"^5^February 25, 2010
magnum24, ^4125897^2^0^"After reading 'The Glass Castle' I wanted to buy a copy for all of my friends. The author uses humor in such a unique way in describing her dysfunctional
childhood. She is an amazing person and a very
gifted author. I loved this book enough to read it more than just once. It's a keeper."^5^March 6, 2009
Proudmami01, ^4125897^1^0^"This is an amazing book. It is incredible how Jeannette Walls took her childhood and turned it into such an amazing story.

MsJudee, ^4125897^1^0^"It is so well written, you just get totally wrapped up with the experiences of this family and their way of life. A different type of story and exposes a way of life most of us have not experienced; loved the author's honesty."^5^March 16, 2014
YoAmoMusic, ^182514965^11^1^"I read this book because we had to read it in class. this book was to me sad because it was based on a young man's struggle to survive a Holocaust concentration camp since he and his father had to go to many. this is a good book if you are interested in WWII or the Holocaust!!!

pepppp, ^182514965^1^0^"Wow! What a book. This cruelty shouldn't be bestowed on anyone. I have heard of this through history, but I never even started to imagine the happenings that happened to these men, women and children. I definitely am going to purchase more writings of Elie Weisel. We all need to be better educated of the evils that happened to the Innocent throughout history."^5^March 27, 2014
Nurseforlife1111, ^182514965^1^0^"I was assigned this book my junior year in high school so I wasn't thrilled to read it. As we went through it though, I fell more and more in love with it. It definitely brought tears to my eyes more than once. I'm a sophomore in college now, just bought the book and don't want to put it down."^5^August 23, 2013

lovesapuzzle, ^403453^14^0^"Great book, especially for all WalMart associates. Funny and very informative. Helps you get to know the real Sam Walton, and understand why we go through all the changes that we do."^5^February 18, 2010
Joecr, ^403453^9^2^"I have read hundreds of books on business, Sam Walton's autobiography is one of the best without the academic jargon. It is simple, warm, and shows the character of a good and caring man. It also reveals the principles for success in business in a competitive environment. Years before they went bankrupt, I went into a competitors store and saw future failure in every area. They should have applied the thing in Sam's book instead of playing the Wall Street big-shots.

I see the same thing in Central America. I wish this book was in Spanish; it could be the best gift to young people studying business there."^5^May 17, 2008
DCAssociate, ^403453^7^0^"This book is very interesting and informative to the success of Wal~Mart. It explains what it takes to make a business go from good to great, 'the essence of discounting'. Sam Walton's secret is out in this book 'most everything I've done I've copied from somebody else'. Read it, you won't regret you did."^5^January 14, 2008
marriedutopianstriver, ^403453^6^1^"I felt compelled to check out “Made In America” by Sam Walton out of curiosity and pride with being a Walmart employee. I was exposed to some of Walton’s philosophy during my orientation and felt curious to check out more. The following are some of the tidbits included in “Made In America” by Sam Walton:
Pages 1-3: He mentions how his life changed after interviewing with Forbes magazine in October 1985 (after he was named the “richest man in America). A harrowing experience is also recalled when he talks about being “ambushed by The Lifestyles Of The Rich and Famous Guy” at a tennis tournament.
Page 70: Jim Walton recalled how some writers thought that his father (Sam Walton) was a “grand strategist who psychically carried out plans and actualized them with precision”. However, he mentions that the reality was that his father actually “thrived on change” when it came to many decisions.
Pages 80-81: Sam Walton listed some of his family pictures such as those of this parents and grandparents, as well as his wife, children, and a Ben Franklin franchise in Newport, Arkansas.
Page 95: Sam Walton created and wrote down a five year plan of the business ideas that he intended to accomplish. He mentioned that he saved these plans for a long time and found (several years later) that his target goals were exceeded by at least 15 to 20 percent.
Pages 240-241: There is an inclusion of more pictures from Sam Walton’s years with Walmart such as a happy picture of him with his wife Helen. There is also a fascinating 1990 feature of HillaryClinton as Wal-Mart’s Board of Directors.
There is also a postscript by Rob Walton due to the fact that Sam Walton was in the final stages of his life when writing this book. There is much more featured in “Made in America” by Sam Walton for those who are curious to know more about the founder behind Walmart and the actual company of Walmart."^5^November 29, 2013
Husker1954, ^403453^6^1^"A must read for anyone. Mr Sam was an insightful man with a straightforward understanding of how to build a successful enterprise. His ideas can be applied to any business or personal relationships."^5^April 7, 2014

pinktan, ^3431231^22^1^"A friend recommended me to read this book. Out of curiosity I purchased it for myself and was hooked from the first day I started to read. It mysteriously brought me closer to Jesus and I could sense a change in myself. Not only me but my friends and others who are close to me could see the change and they all asked what brought the change. This book tells of Our Lord's mercy and His love for us in such simple words. The conversation between Jesus and Sr. Faustina is just amazing. I definitely recommend this book. Do read even if it is to satisfy your curiosity and you shall marvel at the change it brings in yourself."^5^January 21, 2013

The even more confusing fact is that you guys will NOT match your own website prices (in which i could have purchased it immediately), yet you're spending millions of dollars on an ad campaign stating that you'll match ANY competitor and their prices.

It is totally worth the money and you will not be disappointed with the quality of the movie and the story behind it.

The theme song is not only an award-winner and will inspire you to dance and sing about before you even realize it!! This movie is a must-have for the year and will turn into a classic family addition before long. Don't miss out on the wonderful storyline that transports you to only a 'Disney-bound' snow place that you don't want to leave behind while also helping everyone understand how important friendships carry you through all of your life.

It is a wonderful story full of characters to love (Elsa, Anna, Kristoff), characters to hate (Hans) and those for comic relief (Olaf and Sven). The soundtrack is wonderful as well. One of the biggest movies of 2013, an academy award winner for best animated movie and best song (Let it Go). I highly recommend this movie for kids and adults alike."^5^April 11, 2014

Checharin10, ^33658327^3^0^"The blu ray version with dvd and digital versions is great. I saw Frozen with my Blu Ray player and the audio is awesome specially if you have surround sound or a bar by your tv. It is totally worth the money and you will not be disappointed with the quality of the movie and the story behind it. The music is beautiful and won an Oscar for 'Let it Go' which is one of the best Disney songs out there in my opinion. You will not regret it. Buy ASAP!!!!! :D"^5^March 27, 2014

MovieLover25, ^33658327^2^0^"'Watch out for my butt!!' This has to be one of my favorite lines in this movie!! The entire movie is filled with fun and adventure, It is also full of laughs and life lessons about family and what is truly most precious in life.

Although this movie is rated PG for mild crude humor, it is, I believe, a very well rounded movie for the entire family. This one will be on family's movie shelves for generations to come like so many Disney classics."^5^April 5, 2014

The theme song is not only an award-winner and will inspire you to dance and sing about before you even realize it!! This movie is a must-have for the year and will turn into a classic family addition before long. Don't miss out on the wonderful storyline that transports you to only a 'Disney-bound' snow place that you don't want to leave behind while also helping everyone understand how important friendships carry you through all of your life. All sisters should watch this together and folks of all ages will be delighted and transported to the Disney child in all of them!!"^5^March 21, 2014

AliceFan1, ^5147600^5^5^"You ever talk to your car? Well in this excellent film by Pixar, welcome to a world where the cars talk to you! Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen, a brash, full of himself rookie race car on the brink of winning the championship, when he gets seperated from his transport truck and ends up in the forgotten desert town of Radiator springs on old Route 66. His arrival comes on the heels, (Or should I say, WHEELS), of a whirlwind of destruction that doesn't endear him to the locals especially Doc Hudson (Voiced by Paul Newman), the local judge who sentences McQueen to community service of repairing the damage he has wrought before he can leave. At first McQueen fights his punishment, but as he comes to know the denizens of the small forgotten town, he slowly learns that there are more important things in life then winning races and faster is not always better."^5^June 12, 2008

aAshleyB, ^344367963^3^0^"This is one of my favorite Disney movies; there's soo much to love here.  The traditional animation is beautifully done, and I'm soo happy I can finally add the Blu-Ray Anniversary edition to my small collection.
It looks good on a shelf, especially sitting next to The Lion King.

Realistically, I give this movie a 4/5 stars.  I gave it the 5th to counter the previous critics harsh review.  They must not have looked very thoroughly, because both the case itself and the outer sleeve indicate on the back that the movie is 'Full Screen', and specifies the full-screen ratio for both the DVD and BLU-RAY versions.   It does not list 'Wide-Screen', which is a clear indication that it does not have a wide-screen display available.  It is listed in the following manner:
'Blu-Ray: 1080p High Definition - Full Screen (1:33:1)'
'DVD: Full Screen (1:33:1)'

Parents: The only warning I have to issue if you're considering this movie for young children is that there is a scene in which a deer is shown getting shot by a hunter, but it is not bloody or gruesome. 

I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do!"^5^August 30, 2017

I had previously thought of them as separate stories, but this series makes it one flowing story bringing out the tight connections between them as first one, then the next, by virtue of innovative thinking, supersedes the prior titan.

Though there are obvious breaks for advertisements in this made for TV series, and though the summaries are at times very repetitive, they DO serve to reminder the viewer of the overarching story."^5^January 17, 2016

Sofia is 8 years old princess that needs to learn all the manners and those things..
and she has fun doing it, some obstacles but nobody eats nobody, nothing gets
sliced, nobody gets poisoned or cut the heart out or pusheed off the clif kind of deal.
so buy with confidence, very kid friendly and parent friendly movie with morals
lessons and all that.
to make full experience get your costume and tiara and necklace to go with it
but not the ones that come with it.. dvd comes with tiara to make which is piece
of paper. I am talking to buy real tiara and real necklace and real
dress . now hard to find but still doable. look and google.

we absoultely love and adore the movie.
ours has been shipped the evenning before the 5 of march so we got it
one day prior to officila release probably because postal service was fast
and we had fun watching it three days ago. so much fun. my little
ones watch over and over and over and over again.

totally recommend."^5^March 7, 2013

It is interesting enough that we can watch it as a family, but not too 'violent' so that the kids can get into Star Wars as well. The only thing I will mention is that the separately sold movie 'Spark of Rebellion' is included in the series as episodes 1 and 2.

TheDailyWalk, ^15932791^3^0^"I first heard about Bonheoffer a couple of months ago in a class that was being given at church. A lot of his philosophies where discussed and when I saw his biography being offered for review form Thomas Nelson I jumped at the opportunity to dive deeper into his life.

New York Times best-selling author Eric Metaxas provides a very detailed account of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's epic life. From page one to five hundred forty-two Metaxas fully engulfs you in the life and times of Bonhoeffer. This book takes your from his early childhood to his involvement in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and ultimately to his execution. Along the way you learn holf Bonheoffer's life shapes his theology and development of the Confessing Church.

I was not disappointed with this book at all. I feel that it is a great book for anyone who calls themselves a Christian should read. It is a story of someone who was not afraid to pay the ultimate price for his faith.

Of all of the lines in the book I feel that this spoke most to me, and still rings true to this day:

I love Shane wrote this book. I knew he was funny!!! But now I feel like I know a bit more of what makes Shane the funny dude he is. He has a very dark sense of humor.

Amari, ^54868902^7^0^"As a huge fan of Lilly Singh and her work, many may assume I'm obligated to writing a positive review on her book just because I support her. Despite this presumption that some may make, I can honestly say Singh's debut book 'How To Be A Bawse' is an insightful guide to not just surviving life but conquering it. The book is split up into four sections-Master Your Mind, Hustle Harder, Make Heads Turn, and Be A Unicorn-and each chapter expands on specific ways to act according to these main guidelines of the book. There are vivid visuals at the beginning of each chapter and scattered appropriately within the sections. The appealing colors and organization continue to intrigue the reader all throughout the book. Each chapter is very brief but to the point where it's sufficient enough for the reader to learn from it. The layout and brevity, along with the interactive fill-in-the-blank portions, keep the reader engaged from start to finish. Lilly makes keen analogies that help the reader easily implement her tips into their lifestyle, all while including her worry humor. At the end of every section is a two page portion titled 'Out Of The Blue' where Singh contrasts her life from when she was depressed to her opposing current success. These components do a substantial job at convincing the reader as to why they should take advice from Singh. Overall, 'How To Be A Bawse' inspires the reader that they are capable of reaching success by climbing a metaphorical ladder as any Bawse would."^5^April 9, 2017

Kaybee, ^26676418^3^0^"My mother is quite disappointed with most of the shows on regular television these days, as the quality and level of morality of the new shows have declined in her opinion.  She always talks about the television shows of the past like The Waltons or Little House on the Prarie and how she believes the stories were well written and told. So I thought this would be a great Christmas gift for her since she still uses a DVD player.  She loved her gift and has been watching a couple of shows per day when she has time.

Messenger, ^19798171^1^1^"I just finished this book yesterday. I enjoyed it very much. This man was so nice and really down to earth. Just a regular guy that God choose to reveal to him a wonderful experience to share with others. The entire book was not all about Heaven, but about 70 percent had to do with his NDE and what he was allowed to see when he was there. I thought it was a very good book, because I love reading about the NDE. If your looking for a book that is all about Heaven and the NDE I would highly recommend 'Embraced by the Light' by Betty J. Eadie. Another favorite all about what Heaven is like for those who choose Jesus thru eternity would be 'A divine revelation of Heaven' by Mary K. Baxter. Out of all the books I have read,  and there are a lot, I liked these 2 books the best because they descried Heaven just so Beautifully. I hope that I was able to help as many Souls as possible with this review. Love To All."^5^October 25, 2016

I was not disappointed. This is the funniest LEGO Star Wars show that has come out, but not goofy funny. Its story plot is very creative, and there are very many characters created exclusively for this show, which is a good thing, because LEGO never really does that with Star Wars, and all the characters from the original Star Wars are portrayed in a hilarious way!

CelticGirl, ^56133152^4^0^"I Can Only Imagine will take you on a journey, an emotional roller coaster ride you didn’t see coming.  This book will make you laugh until you cry and break your heart to the point of tears all the while lifting you up due to seeing God's grace in action. You will be carried through the roughest time, one that no child should ever go though, and see how the grace of God, and music, set Bart on a path to bring him where he is today. Your heart will sink a little when you get to the word Conclusion, but this truly is a book that once you start; you won’t want to put it down. Be warned though, you may need a few moments to come up to breathe throughout the book. Yes, you will be drawn in that much. It’s also a story that will stick with you long after you read the last word. It’s definitely a ride you will not want to miss. The book will fill in those spots that time won't allow the movie (which comes out on March 16) to cover.
I Can Only Imagine is a lesson of listen and let God nudge you in a direction you thought was possible only in dreams.

Becky, ^56133152^4^0^"Bart Millard’s book I Can Only Imagine was a book that I had to put down several times while I was reading it. His captivating, emotional, and spiritual roller coaster journey through life was so profound and impactful that at various moments I found myself crying so much that the words on the page became too blurred to read and other moments where the overwhelming urge to simply stop, pray, praise God, and worship was simply too much to ignore (as if we should ever ignore that urge). Bart’s honesty about the trials, failures, obstacles, and triumphs is nothing short of inspirational. If you are looking for a book that is uplifting, honest, and lays out the vital truths of God’s anointing upon a person’s life and His divine mercy and grace, then look no further than I Can Only Imagine.

It is a great way to understand the man and the legend. I have been a MJ fan my entire life, I miss Michael Jackson dearly and this book brings be joy. It makes me feel at peace with his untimely passing. I'm so glad the book was re-released----I missed it the first edtition. Would buy for a friend as well.

I've been anxious to own this book for a long time since I was too young to be interested in reading when the first edition was out.

MJ has been a huge influence in my life from his talent, his dedication, music, his ability to love and endure challenging situations. Reading and imagining him telling the stories in the book when he was on top of his game gives a whole new perspective and understanding to the person he was as a child and as a man.

I haven't finished it yet but I wanted to convey how pleased I am with Wal-Mart and The Estate of MJJ for this re-release in this time of grieving."^5^October 14, 2009

I have always been intrigued by the illustration he drew of himself with 1998 inscription. My friends and I pondered for years what he meant by this - retirement...end of his life's mission...we never knew.

Having been somewhat familiar of the Wilder family story and the Adam's Road band, I wanted to see what really happened behind the scenes. Lynn does a very bold job of sharing all of the ups and downs, good times and bad, as her family struggled to accept faith in the Biblical Gospel that would eventually tear them away from the Mormon church. A former BYU professor, she and her family were deeply invested in the Mormon church and gave up considerable amount to follow the Jesus of the Bible.

What a great story and I hope many people are able to come to know this family as I have. God truly is good!"^5^August 22, 2013

Nilmar2, ^20529315^8^3^"Having recently read Bill O'Reilly's fabulous 'Killing Lincoln' i really had my hopes up for his book on the Kennedy assassination. It's disappointing. Unfortunately the book misses the mark. Most of the book details the years leading up to the assassination, mostly focusing on JFK and Jackie's relationship against the backdrop of the White House, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile crisis. There is very little on the assassination itself, very little about Oswald, nothing about Ruby and virtually nothing about the crazy quilt of conspiracy theories, conspiracy theorists and weird characters which have so added to the overall feeling of 'something is not right with this picture' when we look back at the assassination. In fairness the title of this book is really misleading it has very little to do with the assassination and presents no new evidence or information. It is well written but i had hoped for better."^3^October 18, 2012

I have watched all of Season 1 of the series and am currently watching Season 2. So far, the book is telling about her life upon arriving in prison and all that goes on and how she is watching what she does so she fits in well with the other inmates and does not get in any trouble. This book, so far (I am on page 102) is not following exactly what is happening in the series. A lot of what is in the series is dramatized to make it more interesting and some of what has happened in the series I have not read about yet in the book. But, even if it does not follow the series step by step, I am still interested in reading about this woman's account of her time behind bars in a women's prison. And to be made aware that the people in prison are just like everyone else with feelings, shame, regret. Some have children. Some are short term inmates and some for long terms. A very good read and a page turner."^5^July 7, 2014
katie937, ^14925870^5^2^"I did not have high expectations having heard incorrect things about this book. This book blew me away in terms of good writing and great characters. Yes I know the book is true but the excellent way it is written makes the people in prison seem like fictional characters. You root for them. this book changed by view of women in prison; it is such a good book! Get it from Walmart; they got it to me fast without me paying for fast shipping; it just arrived fast!"^5^July 7, 2014

ohkelleh, ^10300358^1^0^"This book is the exact perspective of almost every parent who has a child who suffers from a substance use disorder. The parallels and emotions so strikingly similar. If you have a child who struggles with addiction, I highly recommend this book. You will realize you are not alone! I read this book, then followed it up by reading his son, Nic's book, 'Tweak'. After that, I read David Sheff's new book, 'Clean' which is a MUST read for anyone who has been affected by the addiction of a loved one, family member or friend."^5^November 6, 2013

Greed in the USA has become nonstop... How much and how often do YOU think to give to the poor? This is a must read by a young woman who is ever grateful to our Lord for everything He gives.

photogirl2010, ^4632689^1^1^"This book, while judging the cover would be a same old blah book, was a very good read.
Based on a true story and written in the style of telling your own story.....
A story of redemtion, love, understanding, compassion and faith in our great God. It pulls you in and won't let you put it down until you read the last paragraph.
I started the first chapter and got called away for a day, but it pulled me back. I could tell right away the general idea of the plot...if you can call it a plot. More like the general direction the story was taking me.
This story brings home the real life story of two very different men and their families, sometimes their lack of family, and the roads that lead them together.
Difficult in varied ways and coming from two differnt walks of life their lives took on a similarity just below the surface of the obvious differences.
This story makes the reader realize that even though we are different; in manner, lifestyle, upbringing, beliefs and morals we really are fundamentaly the same.
We all have hopes and dreams, wishes and fantasies, love and loss, grief and joy.
The line between haves and have nots is very fine sometimes and we all need to be there for one another as we would want someone to be there for us.
I highly recommend this book."^5^August 12, 2010

purchaser, ^216573708^59^41^"Read the entire book it was terrible, she blamed everyone else for her loss. Stop lying so much and be lucky you are not in jail.

Excuses, ^216573708^58^33^"I wanted to like the book because I wanted to like some closure to the terrible outcome of the election.  

The book obfuscates and fails to take an honest inventory of the actions that led to this monumental collapse.  

The book isn't even written by her and is barely ghost written by someone else.  How are you supposed to have a book about introspection if you don't even write it.  

Save the money and excuse making.  If I want to listen to hollow excuses, I can talk to a toddler when they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar."^1^September 23, 2017
