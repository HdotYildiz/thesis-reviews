Nancy, ^45074509^5^0^"Good product, but, I would like to see Walmart carry it in the store, not just online to make it easier to purchase more of them."^5^March 17, 2016
MDaly, ^45074509^3^0^"The product worked once I asked my IT guy at work how to plug it in to get it to work with Skype and a Webcam. There are virtually no instructions that came with the product. The company is really missing the boat failing to put any kind of instructions in with the product. Once I got it plugged in it worked great (was using it to by-pass my sound card which seemed to be going out)."^3^April 7, 2016
DCinNH, ^45074509^2^1^"I bought this  hoping it would allow me to connect my Sirius radio to the usb port in a new Honda (which no longer has an auxiliary port).  It did not work and the packaging indicates it is specially designed for IMAC, MacBook, and MAC mini - which was NOT noted on the website."^1^June 9, 2016

dragonfun, ^45074509^1^2^"I does not work for my PC.  And support wanted me to download a software that will allow them access to my PC so they can SEE what is going on and see if they can make it work.  I do not trust that at all."^1^June 1, 2016

Bill, ^496825171^0^3^"What's not to like?   Great speed, overclockable, and fast delivery  by Wal-Mart.  If it was a chick, I'd kiss it. Amazon was more expensive."^5^March 29, 2018
MkUltra420, ^152752939^0^4^"Skyrim 60 frames per second. GTA V flawless, Elder Scrolls Online while in town I've seen it drop 40 frames per second. Running i7 990x six score 12 thread Alienware 12 gigs of RAM 1100w power supply. I do not like the zero cool. It let my graphics card get too hot so just use MSI afterburner frustrating because I have to activate it every time for some reason my 1050 won't kick on automatically that's MSI problem not the graphics card. This card is extremely large I had to modify my case cutting a hole in the plastic. One other thing the install disc removes your antivirus and tries to install Norton it as a result leaving you vulnerable to viruses. I recommend using Windows 10 drivers instead of using the disc, or download from the website both methods are more secure than the install disc."^5^October 17, 2017
Dilon, ^152752939^0^1^"It's is amazing! Very quiet and can play most games on a high setting! Easy installation and a very good choice for budget set up.  Would very well recommend!"^5^November 10, 2017
alexander f, ^152752939^0^1^"Love how quiet this one is. It's an upgrade from my last graphics card and it shipped fast and had no issues receiving it! Love the black and red and would definitely recommend any of the 10 series GPU's they are worth the investment [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^5^July 4, 2017

PLCGuy, ^47475597^1^0^"Good price for the size, a 5TB was going for this price elsewhere, delivery was as expected, so far it works fine.  Installed into a 2 bay server."^4^December 25, 2016
Patrick, ^47475597^1^0^"I have read complaints about drop-offs, heat, and noise issues.  I have had no such problems.  However, I haven't used this as a main OS drive."^5^December 30, 2016
Jhern73, ^46164909^2^0^"Very quiet and plenty of cables."^5^February 15, 2017
Michtwn, ^46164909^1^0^"This power supply is a great replacement for my computer. It is completely modular, which helps keeping things neat as you don't have to install all the connectors if you don't need them. It could use one more SATA Cable as I have 7 SATA drives, but I made it work with some adapter cables that I had. All voltage very stable."^5^December 14, 2016
Aazari, ^37517575^52^4^"The large size fan and open grid design on the top make sure that all the vent ports on the bottom of the laptop get air flow for superior cooling. The pads with multiple little fans often leave the warmest parts of the machine without good air flow. This cooling pad is actually quieter than my laptop, which is a definite plus! I like the fact that I can turn off the lights on it for energy efficiency. The USB plug having the extra port on the back end so you don't lose use of the port you plug it into is a bonus and a very thoughtful design feature. This unit is a good bit lighter than my old one which was metal. Some people have complained about it seeming 'flimsy' but it seems to be holding up well so far with my Toshiba Satellite S855D-S5120 model which isn't exactly the lightest laptop out there at over 5 pounds.

The fan is totally enclosed so you don't have to worry about things getting caught in it so much if you need to move your laptop while it's on. I know a lot of people complain about not being able to use cooling pads on their laps, but you shouldn't be doing that anyway because the airflow isn't sufficient that way. I get around that by using an old monitor riser(which has an open, gridded underside) flipped over underneath the cooling pad so it can be on my lap, but still gets a lot of air. This arrangement protects both my lap and my computer from overheating, so it's great. About the only thing I see being a problem with it will likely be keeping the thing clean since you can't really get to the fan blades to get the dust off. It will likely have to be taken outside and blown clean with compressed air.

Overall, this item seems to be worth the little bit extra I paid to get it. All of the other ones which were cheaper looked to be a lot less efficient and sturdy and the more expensive ones didn't seem to offer anything to warrant paying the higher price for them. So this is a nice mid-range price alternative."^5^November 10, 2014
fanfan, ^37517575^34^1^"Overall this is a pretty good fan. The fan blade itself is quite large as the description says. There is a button to turn off the blue light if you want to as it really doesn't do anything. As for the fan, there is a wheel type button that can be rolled all the way to one side and the fan is turned off. Roll it to the other side and the fan turns at full speed. All adjustsments in between vary the speed of the fan. It is rather quiet. With the fan sitting flat on a surface, there is room for air to enter from the bottom but it is not that good if it is sitting on your lap or on a couch or blanket without something flat underneath the bottom of the fan base to allow air to enter. The distance between the top of the fan case and the bottom of your laptop is rather short. It would be better if there is a little more distance between the fan and your laptop to allow the air to circulate better but it does work pretty good as is. The USB plug is designed with a 'pass through' connection to allow you to plug another USB cable into the back of it while the fan USB plug is connected into the computer so your port is not tied up with the fan only."^4^January 25, 2015
mscnroo, ^37517575^30^2^"I have owned several different types of laptop coolers and this one has been the best one by far especially for the money! I am extremely pleased with this purchase."^5^September 19, 2014
^37517575^30^2^"I recently did away with my desktop tower, and use a laptop in its place. Since the laptop is constantly running it was getting really hot and shutting down. After using this product, the laptop is always cool and running. I would recommend this product to others."^4^August 15, 2014
G1zm0, ^37517575^21^0^"I have bought and used SEVERAL cooling fan's for laptops, This is the BEST Laptop cooling fan under $20. HIGHLY recommended, Keeps laptop cool to the touch with laptop performing major task and running for several days at a time 24/7 :D"^5^December 24, 2015
MrsLocke2U, ^37517575^15^0^"I ordered this pad through suggestions from my computer geek friends. It was a great price and works exactly as stated. If this helps give a few more years to my computer, then it is well worth the price!"^5^November 3, 2014
YGVIXXBTOBAP, ^37517575^11^5^"This laptop fan was almost perfect. It cooled down my laptop very well. The highest setting of the fan was pretty quiet, especially when the laptop was on top of it. Whereas the lowest setting turns the fan off. The extra USB port attached to the fan's USB plug that goes into the laptop is a plus, as is the button that allows you to decide if you want the light to be on or off.

My only concern is that the bottom of the fan is a bit skeletal and therefore must be placed on a flat surface. If placed on your lap, the angles, nooks, and edges dig into the thighs and knees. This also means the clothing you wear on your legs might slip into the small openings of the fan at the bottom and bother the fan blades.

Otherwise, very promising."^5^March 22, 2016
KReynolds88, ^37517575^6^0^"Pros: Runs well, Quiet, LED lighting is cool looking.

Con: Definitely smaller than stated. Says fits up to 17 inches. My laptop is bigger than the cooling pad by 2 inches."^3^January 12, 2017
gabbycash72, ^37517575^5^1^"I have a '14 inch Google Chromebook with a built in fan, but it overheats when I have it on my lap. Overheating made my computer run slowly. Now that I have this fan, my computer is running fast again. My computer sits perfectly in the center of the fan, the light is cool, the fan runs so quietly that you can't hear it, and the platform is even slanted raising the back of the laptop. Glad I bought it."^5^April 17, 2017
miguybill, ^37517575^4^35^"This is the third cooling pad I have owned. I broke the first one by dropping it. The second one's fan was weak and it wasn't sturdy. This one is working just fine. Laptop fits on it securely, fan speed is adjustable and it has cool blue lights too."^1^November 6, 2014
allgood1, ^37517575^4^3^"The fan is extremely loud and stops when under the laptop."^1^July 18, 2015
Disatisfied, ^37517575^4^0^"Do what you want, but I would not waste my time getting this cooler. I ordered it and when I got it, I hooked it up to my computer. It has a huge fan blade, which when on high, blows about as much air to the computer, as when your breathing out your mouth normally, which does nothing to cool your computer. I have no idea, why it doesn't blow more air?? Also, had a noise when running it, even on low. Again, don't waste your time. I had to go to Walmart and get a refund."^1^September 28, 2016
RamblingMoon, ^37517575^3^1^"As soon as I got this, I plugged it in and left. When I came back, I thought my laptop would be cool- it was not. I then restarted my laptop to see if that was the issue, but still no dice. I adjusted my laptop so the vents were over the fan and it still didn't cool it down. So in the end I'm going to have to return this, it's just not sufficient for my laptop. Also it is VERY uncomfortable to use on your legs or lap, the underside digs into your skin.  On the upside, liked the usb plug alot and it seemed sturdy along with being long enough for versatile placement. The button for the light doen't work at all and the fan does not feel very powerful. My Iaptop is from 2010 & is 15. 6 ' so maybe if you have amore recent brand or centered air vents this could work for you."^3^July 24, 2016
tigerp11, ^37517575^3^0^"My wife lap top kept  getting hot so I ordered this  laptop fan. Her lap top no longer gets hot she is happy and that makes me happy."^5^March 2, 2018

iloiloguy, ^37517575^2^1^"This Thermaltake Massive V20 notebook cooler runs smoothly and quietly, though not silently at any speed. I have owned this cooler for only two days and cannot fault anything about it. Its footprint matches that of my 14' Dell Latitude E6420 almost exactly. It seems to be sturdy and well-made. Everything about it is exactly as promised with no surprises, good or bad. Even the packaging is first rate. The power cable is not flimsy and measures 26.75 inches (67.9 cm) in length. That's plenty. Weight is very low. Power consumption is very low also. LEDs are attractive and do not disturb me. It is simple and lacks nothing. I'm happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product."^5^April 22, 2015
Zweely, ^37517575^2^0^"i always had a hard time finding a good cooling fan for my 17' laptop. This one fits great and you have to keep checking to see if it's working because it's soooo quiet! Love it!"^5^November 22, 2014
rg1945, ^37517575^2^0^"This is 6th laptop cooler I've bought of various brands and easily the most disappointing. The bottom has 'legs' in the corners and rather sharp edges making it very uncomfortable to sit on your lap, which I do a lot. Based on the design, this appears to be designed for hard surface use only , a.k.a. desktop.

Bottom line, if you plan to use this on your lap, I'd avoid this product"^2^January 8, 2016
grammakatie, ^37517575^2^0^"this is something recommended to me by another Walmart shopper. it works great and should be used by anyone owning a laptop. I believe it enhances my use and I hope to buy one soon for my sister ,daughters and grandson."^5^November 20, 2014
mocabean, ^37517575^1^1^"This product is very sharp looking but once i went to use the product i realized it was too small for my needs. I would recommend this product to someone using a tablet type product but not someone with a full sized laptop product. The product does not keep my laptop cool enough when im gaming therefor im having to look for a bigger item to suit my needs."^2^November 18, 2014

AvidCamper, ^37517575^1^3^"Overall this is a great fan. It fits my 17' Alienware like a dream, I rarely have to worry about it overheating, the light is nice to have though rarely used, and the dial to let you control fan speed is fantastic.

On the other hand, the fan should really only be used if your laptop is on a desk. The frame is EXTREMELY uncomfortable and leaves bruises on my legs when I use my laptop on my lap. I'm going to need to look into buying a tray for the fan to sit on, which kind of defeats the purpose of its low price."^4^August 16, 2015
SteadyComputerUser, ^37517575^1^0^"We've had it for only a week but so far it works beautifully.  For the last 6 months, our 17', 7 lb desktop computer (gaming) was overheating after as little as 45 minutes (presumably due to a broken fan), and its network card was being affected by the heat within minutes.  This fan has eliminated the overheating problem to the point where it remains cool even after it has been on for 48 hours straight.  That shocked us, since we mostly expected the fan to simply compensate for weak  interior cooling for only a limited time.  Along with the cooling, the sluggish network behavior seems to have ended.  

By the way, the fan is virtually silent, just as people say."^5^November 14, 2017
1Oldschooler, ^37517575^1^0^"DSL modem was always overheating. Placed this fan underneath the modem and...PROBLEM SOLVED!!!"^4^January 27, 2017

Libby, ^37517575^1^0^"Keeps my laptop cool and has a neat blue light"^5^April 5, 2018
Sparkycus, ^37517575^1^1^"Unfortunately, the one I bought, was 'Dead in the Box'. Tried to get it to do something, on two different computers. The USB plug allows you to piggy-back another USB adapter on it. When I put my mouse adapter into the plug, the mouse
would work, but not the Thermaltake Fan or the silly lights."^1^January 10, 2016
Rick, ^37517575^1^0^"Item was just as described works great . It is thicker than most Laptop fans which gives to a bigger fan. Bought this as a birthday present need to order another one for myself as it is much better than the one I have"^5^February 9, 2018

Sims, ^37517575^1^1^"I use my laptop for everything, work and gaming, had an over heating problem, my laptop gets warm but it's doesn't get scorching hot as it use to during gaming, problem solved. I don't know if I'm under rating this fan because I never purchased a high end cooling fan it's not to my knowledge if other cooling fans keeps laptops completely cool with no warmth, but in my opinion it works and I'm no longer burning my fingers whenever I touch my laptop to see how hot it is.

Note:
Fan is extremely quite for that I would rate it a 3.5 or even a 4."^3^December 10, 2015
Disappointed, ^37517575^1^0^"I am very impressed on how well this laptop-cooling pad works. The adjustable fan produces an excellent airflow at a low setting. And at the high setting it is very quiet. It is so quiet I cannot hear it when it is running at any speed. I appreciate that the manufacturer made the USB plug-in allowing me to plug my mouse into the back of the USB plug-in. The nonskid pads built-in to the cooling pad work better than I had expected."^5^September 29, 2016
Peekaboo2318, ^37517575^1^0^"This item was everything i needed and more! My old laptop cooling fan was on its last leg standing. Thankfully i found this on Walmart and after reading the reviews. I made the purchase . First off its super quiet, keeps my laptop nice and cool no more over heating , and the shipping was free two day. Can't go wrong with that . XD"^5^March 9, 2017
Mathi, ^37517575^1^0^"I work from home and have multiple peripherals connected to my laptop and very rarely shut it down. I always have a need for a cooler. This is my third one. The previous ones started becoming noisy after a couple of months and had small fans.

The fan on this is truly massive like it says and I've had this for about 2 months. It's very quiet. I hope it stays that way.

I use other free-standing cooling fans from ThermalTake and have been very happy with them.

Fantastic buy for the price!"^5^December 31, 2016

Fermin O, ^167919436^1^0^"6 cores 12 threads, best upgrade for my pc yet. easy to install. comes with the amd cooler wich in my opinion some of the best looking stock coolers ive seen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^5^April 24, 2017
Steven A, ^167919436^1^0^"I paired this CPU with 16GB of Corsair Dominator 3200 memory and an ASRock X370 Taichi MOBO. I haven't tinkered with an overclock too much being that I can't get the MOBO to run the RAM at the rated speed even with the latest BIOS update. The processor itself is fantastic though, even at stock speeds. For anybody old enough to remember when AMD put out it's first dual core Athlon processor, this CPU brings back those same kind of memories. It multi tasks like a champ. It feels quick and responsive. It does indeed bump up my minimum frame rates in games like Overwatch and Titanfall 2 if you wondering about those. And all in all, it is a great processor.

ByronTech900, ^20449158^31^8^"For those of you who are having issues with your PC shutting down randomly, and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars taking your computer to a shop: Purchase some of this, with some alcohol swabs.

Dust accumulates between your CPU and your Heatsink, which causes your thermal sensor to read too high. Removing the heatsink, and swabbing away the dust with an alcohol prep pad until you have an even, polished shine, and then applying some Arctic Silver 5 to about 75% of the (dry) heatsink (leaving some space around the edges), and then reattaching the heatsink to the CPU will fix the majority of overheating issues.

This is all much easier than it may sound, and I encourage you to use google/youtube for an easy guide on how to do this, with step by step visual instructions.

And it only costs you about $10, as opposed to a few hundred had you taken your PC to the shop."^5^March 1, 2012
Ahmed79, ^20449158^27^5^"My PS3 was not working, I has what they call the 'yellow light of death'. So I read a lot of this case and I learned how to fixed. Arctic silver thermal compound was the best recommended thermal paste and it worked with me pcerfectly"^4^July 8, 2012
Robotman123refer, ^20449158^17^0^"I'm using this paste on my watercooled cpu, atleast 20% better than oem pastes.
A bit more pricey on wallymarty dot comy buuuut i had a gift card and got it here a day earlier than what the estimated arrival date was.
I will update load temps, variables, and system specs once the paste has gone through it's 200hr break in period.

Conclusion: Less is more when applying. If you don't know much about thermal compounds, and want a tried and tested favorite in the enthusiast community, pick some of this up! *cough* amazonian *cough*new *cough* egg

lol

The pictures attached are of the water block to my NZXT Kraken x60 The paste that was on there is the stock paste that came pre applied. I'm not even going to try that paste, Always use my As5 i delayed install for 2 days for it hah. (like I said I thought it was going to be three)

p.s. People, please look up the application intructions for your cpu, when i was a noob, the first time i applied this i used too much, not only did i get non-optimal temps but the Thermal Compound leaked into the socket. I had to clean my 8350 with a tooth brush and rubbing alchohol (works great btw)

Rub it on the heatsink with a credit card, wipe of excess, put a dot right in the middle, about the size of a grain of rice if it was round. About the size of an uncooked dried pea. (2-3mm)

Hope this helps."^5^November 24, 2013

undertone, ^20449158^8^2^"I have been using this Thermal Paste for years to use on out of the Box CPUs and to replace the terrible stuff on CPU from factory computers. It works awesome. For the factory computers it normal even helps reduce the amount of radiated heat from the chassis (important for laptop users) and helps the computer become stable if overheating was the issue."^5^March 12, 2013
EagleTalonZ, ^20449158^5^3^"We used this on our PS3 after it overheated and then developed the 'yellow light of death' (YLOD). The compound does what it is intended to do but the price was a little much for so little. I was expecting much more. (about the size of a pinky finger) Still, I would recommend this if you're having overheating issues.

Also, fyi - if your PS3 is a victim of the YLOD, your PS3 will need to be reballed professionally for a more permanent fix. Putting this compound on it will only make it last about another 4-6 months."^4^June 16, 2012

Alex, ^20449158^3^0^"When I was cleaning my computer, I removed the heat sink from the CPU.  This created poor thermal contacted afterwards because the computer fan was always on full blast.

Espo24, ^44362746^7^0^"I purchased this item because my MacBook was overheating more often than usual; getting hot and the fan was kicking on. Someone told me to get a cooling pad, and the Aluratek Slim looked like a good choice; reasonably price and thin enough to fit in my carry case along with my Mac.

It works great! I just plug the USB into the Mac and the fans work to cool it down. The pad adds a little height when I use on my desk and is comfortable to use on my lap if I'm sitting on the sofa. I definitely recommend."^5^September 29, 2017

SportsterBlues, ^34405972^44^8^"I've used three other cooling pads for my laptop, but with all of them I still suffered with the computer shutting down from temperaures. I decided to give this unit a try after reading great reviews online.. SO far the computer hasn't powered off once. The dual fans keep plenty of air moving and keep the laptop cool. I can feel a difference when I put my hand near the exhaust vents on the side of the computer. With the other coolers, the air was extremely hot, but with this Thermaltake the air coming out of the vents never get more than warm.
I would recommend this cooler to anyone who has overheating issues with thier laptop.
This cooler has blue LCD lights which look cool, but I don't use them. The fans have a variable speed control, and once the unit is pluggered in there is an extra USB port for convenience.
All in all this is the best laptop cooler I've used and worth much more than it's cost."^5^January 22, 2016

MrPino, ^34405972^13^2^"I have several laptops and a couple of them tend to overheat at times. Since using this cooler the heat problem has been completely resolved. I have a temp. measuring program (speedfan) that shows the various internal temps of the computer. This cooler drops those temps dramatically. A VERY good product."^5^May 10, 2016
TimeTorn, ^34405972^12^1^"I would recommend this laptop cooling pad to anybody who likes to use their laptop in bed, or on the couch, anyplace where there isn't a flat surface like a desk, and the vents could get blocked by bedding, clothing, cushions, etc. I would also recommend this cooling pad for anybody who wants to provide extra cooling to their laptop, to help the laptop fans run more silently, or to extend the life of their laptop.

I would advise anybody who is having overheating issues with their laptop to first dust out their laptop with compressed air. If your laptop is more than a few years old, or you run the laptop in a particularly dusty environment, it might be time to do a deep-clean of your laptop. This entails taking the laptop apart to gain access to the fans and heatsinks. Over time, large dust balls can accumulate, even forming something similar to what you pull from the lint filter in your dryer. Obviously obstructions like these are going to insulate your laptop, making it difficult to cool. The laptop will need to be opened up in order to pull these out, especially if you've already tried compressed air with less than desirable results. This lint can eventually stop your fans from spinning if not removed on a regular basis. It can also cause your fans to fail prematurely.

Do not be afraid of disassembling your laptop!! It's not that big of a project, and does not require any special skills or tools beyond just watching a video tutorial on youtube, and a small Phillips screwdriver. The typical procedure goes like this.. Remove the screws from the bottom of the laptop, remove the plastic piece above the keyboard if it is separate, remove the keyboard (usually there are tabs that you have to press in with a flathead screwdriver). Then you will remove any screws you can find that were under the keyboard and top plate. Now the bottom should separate from the top, and you should have easy access to the fans. You might need to unscrew the fans in order to clean the lint between the fans and the heatsinks.

If you've dusted out your laptop, and done a deep cleaning, it might be time to re-paste your CPU and GPU, and apply new thermal pads. Generally this should be done at least once every 5 years. Again, you can find videos on youtube that will show you how, probably even a video that shows for your specific laptop model.

Be careful not to misplace any screws, or mix them up. If you try to screw a long screw into a short hole, you might strip out the hole. If you try to put a short screw in a long hole, your laptop might not hold together as it should.

To avoid doing this, mark each screw and screw hole as you take it apart. Silver and gold sharpies, or nail polish, white out, etc. Just don't use nail polish with glitter since this might conduct electricity and short out the motherboard if you use it to mark on the motherboard.

You could also set up a camera to record you while you're taking it apart, then if you misplace a screw, you can re-watch the footage to help you figure it out."^4^April 21, 2017

It fits underneath my laptop perfectly and has a couple parts that pop out to elevate the stand, if you want to do so. There are also a couple parts that pop up on the front to hold the laptop in place if elevated. It feels very secure. Then the fans cover almost the entire bottom of the laptop with an easy dial to turn the fans on/off and also increase/decrease the speed of the fans. There's also a button to turn on the blue led lights which give it a nice look. Really nice product!"^5^February 14, 2016

twosmartshopper, ^34405972^3^11^"This has all 5 star reviews so I am taking my 2 star rating seriously.
The fans work fine or seem to. They are not silent but not an annoying hum.

The problem is that this cooling fan will NOT stay on the huge plastic lap desk that I have. Just the back bumpers have some rubber on them there is just slick plastic on the front bumpers. Add to this that the 2 front fold out tabs that keep the lap top on the cooler fan stand, hit right where my wrists rest to type. It was not 10 min. and I had huge red spots on my forearms from the tabs rubbing on my arms as my fingers moved over the key board. The slant height adjustment was just adequate and nothing special.
I guess I will go back to the Cool Master as I had before and am using now without the fans. It's metal mesh has terrific bumper stops that do not stick out but absolutely stop the lap top from sliding down the cooler fan frame. Nothing sticking out ! And....the Cooler Fan frame is metal as I said and the bumpers on the front and back grip my desk lap top tray like velcro. The frame is good and solid. The fans lasted about 2 maybe 3 yrs. and were somewhat noisy.
But this thing cannot hold a candle to a Cool Master for about the same price."^2^July 24, 2015

debkins3, ^34405972^2^0^"I have a 19' laptop and although this fan is a tad smaller it works great to keep my machine from overheating. The dial controls how high to set the fan on and there is a switch for the blue light (pretty retro), which I only use to remind me that it's still on. So I always turn the light on when I turn on the fan to remind me that it's all on. So when I turn off my laptop I'll remember to turn off the fan as well. If you don't shut it off it will continue to stay on because it is plugged into the computer, (runs while plugged in). 

Great laptop fan. I am happy with this purchase."^5^August 7, 2016

earp8867, ^14262374^20^0^"Other cooling devices may be cheaper, but this is of a much more indestructible quality, and able to withstand picking it up and setting it down repeatedly. It is very lightweight, and at a perfect angle to do hours of work and not become any more uncomfortable than sitting at a laptop doing hours of work itself. It is also designed in a way that should the fans fail(over time), and thus no longer cool the laptop itself, it still will provide complete alleviation of the heat from the laptop to your legs/body, unlike the cheap $17 device I previously owned, which became immediately unusable once the brittle plastic broke and thus collapsed, and the cheap welding of the USB connection gave with normal, careful use."^5^September 24, 2013

Cathy, ^14262374^10^0^"I just purchased my second one of these. I had the first for about 5 years... still have it, actually. The fan stopped working about a year ago but I still used it to keep my laptop off my lap and keep air circulating under it. I purchased the first at my local Walmart, but they didn't have it this time. I purchased a different, cheaper one that they had in stock and it was worthless. My laptop slid off of it when I moved it, was a little small for my 17 in laptop, felt cheaply made, and it didn't have a good fan. So I ordered this one online with free store delivery. This one is quiet, works well, the laptop sits well on it and doesn't slide off with the least movement. The angle of the surface is just right for typing while in your lap, and it keeps your legs from getting hot from the laptop. It's perfect, and well worth the price. I highly recommend this product."^5^March 19, 2016
agenttexx, ^14262374^10^0^"I ordered this to resolve cooling issues with a Compaq Presario CQ62. This series of laptops suffer from well-documented over-heating issues due to lack of adequate ventilation, inadequate cooling fan, and the location of the hard-drive causes the entire left side of the laptop to overheat to the point it is hot to the touch. Bad combination for a laptop.

My solution was to elevate the laptop at roughly 30 degrees and point a fan towards the gap to circulate air underneath and away the machine - problem solved, however, having to use a large fan placed strategically just to use my laptop is not a permanent solution.

I chose the Targus because I elevated the laptop to allow for cooling, the laptop sat of a grate that allowed airflow, and the mat has two USB-powered fans to circulate air. The air is pulled in and up toward the laptop.

Unfortunately, the fans are very underpowered for this task. I believe the system might benefit more from reversing the fans to pull air away and out of the mat, rather than trying to force it upwards. Secondly, having no control over the fan speed means you have no real way to adjust the mat to cool more or less as you would need. And finally, because this system is USB powered, it permanently ties up one USB port, while offering no additional USB ports of its own.

Personally, I like the design of the mat, itself. But the fan placement, direction, and lack of speed control, severely limits the ability of this system to operate as needed. Had I designed the mat, I would have placed a fan on either side of the mat to pull airflow through the system. I also would have added either a switch to allow fan speed adjustment. Finally, an option to power this via DC adapter, implementation of a built in hub, or alternative power options would have been nice.

Perhaps use of a higher RPM fan would alleviate the continued cooling problems."^3^April 26, 2012
mumuf2, ^14262374^9^0^"I bought this because my husband's laptop was overheating. I believe the simpler something is the less chance it has to break down. I didn't want the blue lights found on most fans. Yeah they look cool but the biggest complaint was the lights. I also didn't want one made of cheap plastic. So after a lot of research this one held up. The only con is that it takes up a USB port. However, during my research I discovered you can overload your usb portal chip by putting multiple items in it. So I can unplug my Mp3 player when using the fan and save the laptop. Oh and for those of you who have a 17 inch lap top, my husbands dell fit perfectly. It does not hang over any of the edges. Most of the other reviews reported people getting their wrists scratched, not so with this. The kicker was this had the longest usage reviews. Many stopped working within 4 months. This had some reviews of over 8 months. Will update later in the year to let everyone know what happens!"^5^April 16, 2016

It's a simple item that should be a must have with all laptops because it does the required job of cooling your laptop very well...especially during hot, humid summer days. There are no instructions on how to use it...which is the top or bottom, but there are instructional videos on You Tube that explain everything perfectly.

SorryIdidthis, ^14262374^4^3^"I used ASUS GPU Tweak's GPU heat monitor application as a guide. I noticed that my laptop, when gaming, GPU was operating at about 90C. I was hoping to get that down into the 80's so after reading many reviews I purchased this one. Bottom line my GPU heat under load didnt change at all with the cooling pad hooked up.
I think most of these reviews are based on appearance , user comfort, and portability. These are all covered by a CNET review I read and they are very good. However, I am beginning to believe that , even CNET , did not actually test the function of this device, its ability to lower the operating temperature of the laptop.

Simmyleie, ^14262374^4^2^"Despite the obvious, It is basically your standard cooling pad, albeit with a different design. It is tapered toward the front and raised at the back, to give a laptop a slight incline for comfort during typing etc. The sides are both open so arflow is blown out the sides, good if you have a laptop with vents in the back, but not for those with vents on either side possibly (I have an HP Envy which has its vents on the rear of the case so it doesn't oresent an issue for me, and passive vents on the underside.
My only issue aside from elevevating the laptop and keeping it off surfaces that would inhibit the laptops cooling abilities, is, the fans themselves are a very slow rpm, and possibly have a low cfm, so they really do ot move much air or cool much at ll I would suspect. However I have ony tested this on 2 laptops, my HP Envy, which has a steady 34 C temp rating, and my Toshiba Satellite, which has a 30 C temp. I will try it on the worst possible laptop I own, a nightmare Compaq that is either so poorly made or has serious heatsink issues that it will go to 80 C on a flat surface. If this pad cools that, then I will revise my review, but on my two other laptops I notice no difference in temps whether I use it or not."^3^May 3, 2012

I find this product to be perfect for the job. The cord, which comes out of the back, can reach anywhere on the computer for a USB. You can even shift the cord under the mat and it will reach the front if you need to. The mat seems a little flimsy at first, if you push on the top, it will flex downward, but it holds the computer nicely. The fabric on the bottom of the mat is nice and comfortable on your legs too (I mostly sit with the computer on my lap).

cobra92usa, ^14262374^2^0^"I would recommend this product, marginally. The only advantage this cooler had over other models in the department store the day I purchased it 4 months ago was size. It was the only of the 5 available large enough to accommodate a 17' laptop.

Though there are only two fans, they seem to keep up with the task of cooling. Due to a somewhat lack of rigidity in the design, the fans are often loud or rub on the insides of their housings. This can sometimes be corrected by lifting my laptop and giving a 'swift' smack to the topside of the fan housing. Makes me feel better, and it seems to work at settling the fans down as well. Other times, the fans are hardly noticeable.

Given that this unit uses a valuable USB port, it would be nice if it returned the favor and supplied one in return . . . as large as it is, supplying 5 shouldn't be an issue.

All in all . . . it has been getting the job done and has lasted over four months to date. Money well spent to save from another hardrive 'meltdown'."^3^April 9, 2011

I was skeptical about the cooling pad's performance when I first got it, so was checking many times during the day and every time I touched the bottom of my laptop it was never warm. It was actually a bit cool, as if it was turned off. And up until recently I was using my laptop as a TV as well, a lot of hours on Netflix.

AutoCadDiva, ^14262374^1^0^"I bought the Targus Chill Mat Cooling Stand on impulse without checking it out first. I had just spent days checking and reviewing the new laptop I needed and I got lazy; I thought if HP is suggesting it, it should be good. It is ok. The one HP suggested does not really fit the HP Pavilion dv7t-7000 Quad Edition laptop. The feet don't lineup with the stops. I was able to add sticky back bumpers to the bottom of the laptop to stop it sliding off the stand. The power connecter sticks out a bit far for my liking. Fan is very quiet and seems to work well. I've only had it for a couple of week we'll see how long it lasts."^3^August 7, 2012

FlyingEagle2, ^14262374^1^0^"I purchased this cooling pad when I purchased the laptop. I already knew from reading technical information and a lot of blogs that laptops need to be cooled. This was the first laptop that I had ever owned. The cooling pad does exactly what it says it will do, which is cool down the laptop, sit it at a great egonomic angle for your hands durng typing and it is very comfortable on your lap. I use it on a laptop stand, that I also purchased at the time I purchased the laptop, most of the time. Although my laptop does get very warm after 8 hours of use or more, I've tried it with and without the cooling pad, and the laptop is a lot cooler with the cooling pad after 8 hours then without it. In fact, I would be afraid not to use it again after 8 hours of use."^5^September 30, 2011

I found my laptop that I was using while laying in bed was getting quite hot so I needed something that helped cool it down. This product from Targus does just that. It's quiet too which helps. The only thing I don't care for is that it now gives my laptop a slight tilt which isn't the optimum thing for me seeing as I am using in while laying in bed, but I can live with that. The one thing to keep in mind is that when you close your laptop it does not shut off the fans. It is USB powered so you have to pull the connection to turn it off."^5^January 2, 2012

It is quiet. The Fans cool my gaming laptop very well. It will fit most any laptop and holds it securely - laptops will not slide off of it - the only con I can think of is it is not compact for to store in a carrying case but it will fit in a case with your machine so that really is not a con for me. Underneath the fans the is enough room to store a small gadget while you are charging it. I store my Bluetooth mouse in the top part while it is charging.

Indianapolis, ^14262374^1^0^"I have owned a lot of laptop coolers and this one is really really nice. It looks great, cools great, is very quiet and it has 4 USB ports with a plug for a power supply. However, no power supply is provided with the unit and there is no info supplied by Targus. I had an extra one from another powered USB port so I used it and it and all the ports worked fine. I've used the cooler for the past 3 months and up until tonight it has worked great, then it just suddenly quit working. I thought there was a problem with my laptop drivers or maybe the USB port I was using but after about 40 minutes of trouble shooting I figured out it is the USB ports on the cooler not working properly. I'm not sure yet but I think my power supply has weakened and that is what has caused the cooler ports to not work properly. If I can find a good power supply made for this cooler I will buy iit because I like it that much. Hope this is the problem and I hope Targus has a power supply or a solution on where I can get one when I call tomorrow."^4^December 2, 2010

THIS DEVICE PROVIDES A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IN AUDIO OUT OF COMPUTER VS SIMPLY CONNECTING A CABLE TO THE HEADPHONE JACK ON THE PC AND RUNNING THAT CABLE TO AN INPUT ON THE STEREO RECEIVER OR EXTERNAL SPEAKERS.

I PURCHASED THIS STARTECH DEVICE AS IT WAS ADVERTISED AS HAVING S/PDIF DIGITAL AUDIO OUTPUT. MY TECHNICS SA-DX940 5.1 DOLBY DIGITAL SURROUND RECEIVER HAS SEVERAL OPTICAL DIGITAL INPUTS & I WANTED A OPTICAL DIGITAL OUTPUT FROM MY COMPUTER.

WHAT STARTECH DOESN'T TELL YOU IS THAT THIS DEVICE IS SO SMALL THAT IT DOES NOT USE A STANDARD OPTICAL DIGITAL CABLE WITH TOSLINK CONNECTORS ON BOTH ENDS OF THE CABLE. THE COST WAS MINIMAL, I PAID AN EXTRA $5 FOR A CABLE WITH A 'MINI' PLUG ON ONE END AND IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY PASSING DIGITAL AUDIO TO MY SURROUND RECEIVER.

WHAT APPEARS UNIQUE TO THIS STARTECH DEVICE IS THAT IT HAS ANALOG HEADPHONE OUT AND MIC INPUT IF YOU INTEND TO USE IT FOR GAMING. FOR THE ANALOG HEADPHONE OUTPUT, IT HAS AN ADJUSTABLE VOLUME CONTROL.

PERFORMANCE WISE, AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE SOUND OUT OF THE STARTECH DEVICE IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT FROM SIMPLY CONNECTING EXTERNAL SPEAKERS OR A SURROUND RECEIVER TO THE HEADPHONE JACK OFF OF THE MOTHERBOARD ON A COMPUTER. USING EITHER THE S/PDIF OUT OR THE ANALOG HEADPHONE OUT OF THIS, THE STEREO SOUND IS IMPRESSIVE.

I DO NOT GIVE THIS 5 STARS AS i HAVE A DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1 SURROUND RECEIVER AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT I HAVE YET TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PASS 5.1 AUDIO VIA OPTICAL CABLE FROM MY PC (NETFLIX; HULU OR DVD PLAYBACK OFF THE COMPUTER'S DVD DISK DRIVE) VIA THE STARTECH ADAPTER.

I've also noticed it preforms poorly when in direct contact with copper as apposed to aluminium contacts regardless of air or liquid thermal solutions. Application methods seem to play very little part in this as well.

RayO, ^20449151^2^0^"I have personally used the Arctic Silver line of products for many years and this Arctic Silver 5 (AS5) Poly-synthetic Silver Thermal Compound is the best yet. I use this on any computer that I build, especially my personal ones, because a thermal compound is absolutely vital in assisting in the transfer of the microprocessor's heat to the heat sink. It's far more efficient than regular heat transfer compounds, and despite the high silver content the AS5 Compound is not electrically conductive so it won't short out other components.
This particular product is a great buy if you have large projects or will we be working with several different applications. The extra-large size tube is very cost-effective even if you don't use it often because has a very long shelf-life and doesn't separate while in the tube.
It is very important to note, however, that AS5 doesn't reach it's maximum effectiveness until it has been in use for about 200 hours, during which the joining where the AS5 was used has the opportunity to have been heated and then allowed to cool multiple times, as in a computer that sees daily use but is not left on full-time. It is also absolutely vital that the mating surfaces be extremely clean for the compound to work correctly. Target also sells (as of this writing) an Arctic Silver surface preparation cleaning product. Much more detailed technical information on the AS5 can be had from the product's official web site at http://www.arcticsilver.com/as5.htm
From my 15+ years experience with many different thermal compounds I feel I can wholeheartedly recommend Arctic Silver line as among the very best I have ever used and the Arctic Silver 5 as the best of the Arctic Silver line of products.
If you are interested in the efficient use of this sort of high-performance heat-transfer a quick internet search will show several different write-ups on the best practices to follow."^5^June 7, 2015

summit3122, ^20564382^55^1^"After doing some cursory research on various cooling fans - I was attracted to this Coolermaster X-Slim NotePal Cooler since I wanted something that didn't add bulk or size while I'm working on my computer.

I own a 17.3' laptop computer and the Cooler fits neatly underneath my computer. So far the size hasn't become an issue since the cooler generates a nice amount of airflow.

The three features that I like the most about this purchase is:

1) the noise level of the fan isn't distractible ('sometimes' I have to really listen to hear the fan).
2) with the slim design it doesn't take up any additional space.
3) the Cooler has two legs in the back so that you can elevate it for comfort.
4) the Cooler is well made and reasonably priced.
5) good experience with Coolermaster products.

Since there are numerous choices and options available - I hope that this information to some degree helps with your buying decision.

Happy shopping!"^5^June 17, 2014

uriah369, ^20564382^23^2^"Before getting this laptop cooler my lenovo was getting very hot, like melt your face off hot and shutting off with no warning just a beep which was like a cry for help. Since getting the Coolermaster X Slim it really is a tremendous difference and my laptop stays cool to the touch and only emmits some luke-warm air out of the side vent where as before it was blistering furnace air. I like that the top is a full mesh screen instead of placed vents and the bottom is enclosed which just seems better to me and much more well made than some of the other ones i looked at that were open on the bottom exposing the fans and wires. The one large fan in the center pushes air evenly and the mesh screen top disperses it all over the bottom of the laptop for maximum coolness. The fan is totally whisper quiet and my 16 inch laptop fits nicely with room to spare on all sides. The destgn of the cooler pad is sharp neat and efficient with some well thought out designing for user use such as the usb plug can be used on either side of your laptop depending on where your usb port is located and has a space to fit under the cooler when not in use and the usb has a pass through where you can plug another one into it so you don't loose a precious usb port. I'd like to note that there are no silly blue lights or anything flashy on it so if that's your thing and you want that type of annoying attention to feel cool then you should probably look elswhere or get some christmas lights or something. I would reccomend this product to anyone who needs some serious heat relief for their laptop. Please excuse any typos spelling and grammer mistakes because i simply don't care."^5^January 3, 2014

Drako359, ^20564382^17^0^"Have an old Dell laptop, the one you slide the old cards in for wireless connection...about 10 years old. The laptop can extremely hot on the bottom especially on the keyboard as the heat-sink is very old. This cooler dropped the temperature drastically to the point it felt lukewarm on the bottom and on the keyboard. Temperature dropped about 10 to 15 degrees in my estimation.

Not sure how other people manage to get the USB cable stuck in the fan causing the blades to break has a result, but it seems to me it would be fairly difficult for the for the cable to slip through the slits that surrounds the fan.

Bought two of these on sale for $16.50 each...one for the old laptop and one for my new laptop. For that price and the fact how well the cooler works...there is no excuse for not buying this cooler to extend the life of your laptop."^5^May 28, 2013

karmal, ^20564382^11^0^"My little laptop seems unlikely to heat a house, but by golly it feels like it could! I'm one of the few people who actually uses my laptop IN my lap, but I have to keep a big fan blowing on me just to keep from having hot flashes from all the heat my laptop generates.

I finally broke down and bought one of these cooling fans, and YAY, It works! It's not too big to put in my lap, and it cools not only my laptop, it keeps me cooler, too! It's just a small fan, with a flat, solid mesh on top, and air openings on the sides and bottom, so even sitting in my lap, I'm not plugging up the holes, and air still circulates well.

Pros:
* It's quiet. I forget it's even on.
* Great circulation. No more lap on fire!
* It's sized well. Maybe an inch tall, & my little Asus fits well, with an inch to 2 inches extra around it, so a bigger laptop would fit well, too. It fits my lap, well, also.
* Powered by the laptop, so no long electrical cords/outlets needed.
* Cord storage is right there, and not a mile of cord to deal with.
* USB plug allows you to plug another USB into it, so you don't lose a port to the fan! How great is that?
* My laptop is black, so this black color is perfect, and discreet.
* It has back feet that raise it up on an angle for tabletop use, if you need that.

Cons:
* It is a stiff plastic, so it does dig into my knees a bit. It's rounded, so not so much pain, but I do find myself shifting it a bit after a while.
* You need to be careful when picking it up. The bottom plastic will give and touch the fan blades, if you pick up the whole thing with one hand. (Scared the heck out of me when I discovered this.)

Overall, I love this thing, and am only sorry I didn't get it years ago. Only had it for a month or so, but so far great!"^4^August 28, 2013
Secretj2, ^20564382^10^0^"Pros:
- Works great, keeping my HP DV6-7010us laptop nice and cool, sometimes to the point where my lap gets cold when I spend a few hours gaming on it.
- It's lightweight, adding maybe a pound to the weight of the computer when I move to a different room.
- Being mostly metal mesh, it gets plenty of ventilation, so there's no worrying about blocking any of the airflow, no matter how you sit (i.e., you can have a blanket on and still have good airflow).
Cons:
- None really, except the USB power/pass-through has a bit of a sharp edge so if you aren't careful it's easy to cut yourself. I've done that once, not paying attention. It didn't draw blood though so it can't be too bad."^5^February 2, 2014
Electrical3, ^20564382^9^0^"This is a great cooler!

Since using this cooling mat, my computer barely even gets warm and I've had no more issues with overheating.

If you're looking for a cooler that has several different height settings you may want to pass on this one as it only has 2, flat and slightly inclined...for the price, however, it can't be beat.

Meloccin, ^20564382^2^2^"I can see what they were aiming for with this, but it doesn't hit the mark. It's thin, somewhat flimsy plastic, awkward on your lap and to carry anywhere, and if there's any pressure put on the middle of the bottom where the fan is, it makes a terrible sound because that pressure interrupts the blades. And be careful if you're wearing pants with a drawstring, because the slats on the bottom are large enough for a drawstring to get sucked into and interfere with the fan. Terrible design there.
Also, the feet on it to angle and raise the pad don't like to stay out, and in my opinion, don't do much of anything anyway. I can feel the fan on my legs, and it cools the bottom of my laptop, but doesn't adequately cool the bottom/side where the computer's fan is, due in no small part to there not being any rubber or anything to help your computer stay on the pad. It moves around a lot! I don't like that so much.

I like that it has the cord keeper on the bottom. That's a fantastic idea that more companies/product engineers need to think about..but that's about the only part of the product I like. With the USB plugin being a pass-through (which is also a good idea), it's got an odd raised edge that catches on things (the couch, clothes, etc.) when it's plugged into my computer.

This is getting returned."^2^February 2, 2014
oldITgeek, ^20564382^2^1^"This cooler got good reviews and it does a nice job. Regarding the drawback - one of the reviews I read explained that the cooler was powered by a USB port on the laptop. Unfortunately, the USB cord from the cooler protrudes out the left side of the connector. On some laptops, that cord gets in the way of other ports or devices (such as a DVD drawer). I had the latter problem on the right side of my laptop (it blocked my DVD). Luckily I had other USB ports on the left.

Garland, ^20564382^1^0^"I have an ASUS X53E.  My computer has a metal cover on top, thus helping the heat problem that most laptops have. However, the underside of my computer is plastic.
Over heating is a major problem for most laptops. I haven't had that problem due to the fact that my Asus has a metal upper housing. That being said, I noticed the bottom housing of my computer was much warmer than the top of my housing. 
I thought about how to keep the bottom housing cooler. I started looking at cooling fans as a solution. My laptop was sitting flat on my desk, and heat buildup was a huge problem. The only cooling that was going on was from the side venting. I ordered the Coolermaster-X-Slim-NotePal-Cooler/20564382. This solved two distinct problems. 1.) the computer was lifted above the desk, allowing air to pass underneath; and2.) The huge fan circulated air perfectly allowing for cooler operation and better air flow.  The next thing that was very surprising. When I place my computer on top of the cooling fan, it was as if the fan and frame were manufactured to custom fit my computer. I was amazed  as I had been trying to find a solution for this problem, My computer was not ever over-heating, but common sense tells you that heat will eventually destroy a laptop. If your computer is an all plastic housing there should be no doubt that you need a cooling fan.  I would recommend this particular cooling fan, as it has a metal mesh top, which makes keeping the underside plastic housing from overheating more than another type. Metal acts as a heat sink,(a transfer of heat to metal where it cools circuits and other parts of an electric device., or circuit).  In addition to that being said, I like the slim style, and the fact that I can Place my laptop and my cooling fan inside of my computer case. I was very pleased with their tracking and delivery process as well. especially in this busy holiday season. My overall experience was not 100%, it was 200%. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a laptop or note book style computer, especially if your housing is made of plastic!"^5^December 7, 2016

One issue I should mention is that it was described as being metal. In fact, only the top is metal. I was a bit disappointed in that but as the price was good I decided to keep it.

I mostly use it on a lap desk with the feet up to get more air under it and it works fine. The feet have rubber bottoms to keep it from sliding, which is a helpful feature.

RandomReviewer27, ^20612338^2^0^"My plug in for my headset on my laptop was not usuable and it was suggested that I could buy USB headsets that would have cost me from $75.00 to $150.00. Instead I purchased (I have only had item for 48 hours) this adapter for nominal cost, use my own headset and the sound is great. Just have the volume on one and it sounds good and when in use with speaker it is almost like having a stereo.

It works perfectly for this. Sticks out a bit, so be careful, and takes up one usb slot, not a big deal on my end cause it has 4, but if it's a newer version I think they only have 2, and this would be a problem to charge the controllers and use the head set at the same time.

RockerPanel, ^20612338^1^2^"I actually haven't used this yet, but to get the review spam's out of the way, I'm doing this now.

I purchased this because my daughter has a music player that doesn't have a headphone output, believe that or not, it did have two USB ports for thumb drives. I had hoped that the USB port was more flexible than just being used as an input, but that wasn't the case. I wanted to run the output of the music through a stereo PA, so I purchased this device with the hopes it work with the USB port, and that didn't happen, so I haven't used it other than that.

It does have an small LED's indicating if something is active, and by that I mean plugged in, because the red LED for the headphone was on, but no music was coming out. Again, this is because the music player's USB port wasn't configured the same as a computer's USB port, and this is made for a computer.

Feels professionally built, didn't seem to use cheap products, and for $10, it's nice to just have in the tool box!"^3^August 20, 2014

LovingTheFamilyLife, ^15540326^5^0^"I bought this sound board out of a quick need for some kind of sound card. Boy was I glad I did! I did not expect much from this little guy (it's as long as my thumb and 1.5 times wider). This is definitely one of those times of something large coming in a small package. This USB sound board was super easy to install on my Vista Premium 64-bit OS. Definitely use the software included on the disk as well. It is feature-rich! There are many tweaks with it's 'Entertainment Console' from EAX settings and THX TruStudio Pro settings to it's graphic equalizer and microphone effects settings. Use the 'Crystalizer' to counteract the effects of MP3 compression, the 'Dialogue Plus' to bring vocals forward and improve clarity and the 'Equalizer' to enhance any part of your music that may be lacking due to your speaker performance.

I must admit, I intended to just try this out then return it to Wal-Mart to swap out for another sound card until I got one that I was well pleased with. Needless to say, this thing isn't going anywhere! Evidently, Creative Labs believe that bigger isn't always better. Today, I have been schooled!

Cons: none yet!

Advice: Always go for ball bearing or better. Avoid cheap sleeve bearing fans as they have a shorter life expectancy.

Why: I needed a couple case fans and I had a WM gift card.

Thoughts: I would have appreciated cheaper shipping considering they cut costs by using USPS. Still got here quickly and in perfect condition."^5^March 7, 2011
Equalizer1001, ^15229263^1^0^"This fan did not cool as much as expected even on the highest speed setting. It seemed to push out a lot of air but compared to the one that it was replacing, it was not equivalent. In addition, I used standard case fan hardware (attachment screws - not included) which went in extremely hard.

I purchased this fan to replace an old used one I just installed to keep the temperature down. This was done after adding a fan-less video card. With no case fan I grew concerned with the video card temperature climbing to 131F. After adding the used fan, it brought it down to 113F - 118F, but it was rather loud. The Antec TriCool 80mm Double Ball Bearing Case Fan only cooled the GPU card to 122F - 126F which is not what I was hoping for. I put the old fan back in and returned the Antec TriCool and will just have to deal with the added db's..."^2^May 12, 2012

RedMatt, ^421770568^4^0^"The 8th generation Intel lineup is the biggest step forward since the original core-i series.  They have done this by adding cores and shifting the processors down a price-sku: the new i5 is six cores (previously an extreme edition), and the new i3 is four cores (previous i5).  This makes these chips a real value.  This i5 is sitting in the price/performance sweet spot.

I removed a star for the recently-announced security vulnerabilities that affect this and many previous Intel processors.  The resulting patches may affect performance.  AMD has been competitive with their latest processors and should be considered in a new build."^4^January 10, 2018

Jeff, ^421770568^1^0^"I'm happy to see Walmart finally offering PC components online. To my knowledge they hadn't until recently and after lots of research, I determined that the i5-8400 was the perfect chip for my PC needs (multi-tasking work computer and light gaming) and budget. Just about your entire budget and build revolves around choosing the right processor and after considering just about every chip, I felt like I just had to have the 8400. Unfortunately, everywhere I looked online this particular chip was unavailable. So when I found out Walmart had it in stock and at a great price, I was flabbergasted. So I had to give Walmart a thumbs up for coming through for me. 
As for the processor itself, it's incredible. I believe Coffee Lakes are only compatible with Windows 10 but that's not a bad thing for me personally. It does very well with multitasking network heavy programs and the synergy of the OS and i5-8400 is something special. I ought to take a star off for the Intel cooler it comes with (three of the four legs cracked down the middle when I installed it) but I didn't want to because there's no doubt this processor is a great value for the price and in my opinion the perfect processor for a large number of applications.

..................................................................
The wires that are in side of this thing are very light gauge, thinner than the ones in my 250 w power supply. That would explain the fact that there are very few plugs for extras. CoolMax really dose not wont you to use all 400 w. Only 1 Peripheral power x 4 4-pin. Your computer will need more than that if you plan on any kind of upgrade. No power plugs for the new PCI Express video cards. So forget about a video card upgrade. But if you have to go cheep, it did seam to work OK...um keep a fire extinguisher near by... OK I really don't know if it would over heat. But... Come on, hi power through light gauge wires? I'm just saying...

lgerheart, ^8245532^3^0^"I was extremely impressed with the 500 watt atx power supply that I ordered from Walmart. After going to Walmart to buy a power supply, I figured Wally-World's gotta have it! I was let down they didn't have it in stock at their retail store, however, they said I could go online, order it for $25.00 and free shipping to the store. It sounded like a great deal, since your local 'mom & pop computer shop' charges anywhere from $40.00 to $60.00 just for 1 of these which might only be a 350 watt power supply. I took out the old one, popped the new one in, and everything seemed to be fine. No problems here. I have been using it for almost a month now, so I'm totally satisfied with the price, the wattage, and that it was free shipping. Thanks Wally-World!"^5^July 21, 2008

I find this product to be perfect for the job. The cord, which comes out of the back, can reach anywhere on the computer for a USB. You can even shift the cord under the mat and it will reach the front if you need to. The mat seems a little flimsy at first, if you push on the top, it will flex downward, but it holds the computer nicely. The fabric on the bottom of the mat is nice and comfortable on your legs too (I mostly sit with the computer on my lap).

All in all, I am really enjoying this product and I think it will give me a longer life expectancy for my laptop."^5^August 10, 2013

cobra92usa, ^40870879^2^0^"I would recommend this product, marginally. The only advantage this cooler had over other models in the department store the day I purchased it 4 months ago was size. It was the only of the 5 available large enough to accommodate a 17' laptop.

Though there are only two fans, they seem to keep up with the task of cooling. Due to a somewhat lack of rigidity in the design, the fans are often loud or rub on the insides of their housings. This can sometimes be corrected by lifting my laptop and giving a 'swift' smack to the topside of the fan housing. Makes me feel better, and it seems to work at settling the fans down as well. Other times, the fans are hardly noticeable.

Given that this unit uses a valuable USB port, it would be nice if it returned the favor and supplied one in return . . . as large as it is, supplying 5 shouldn't be an issue.

All in all . . . it has been getting the job done and has lasted over four months to date. Money well spent to save from another hardrive 'meltdown'."^3^April 9, 2011

Karrpk, ^40870879^1^0^"I purchased this cooling stand with dual fans to keep my HP 17inch Pavillion Notebook cooler when streaming a long video session; while I do like that the fans are quiet, the low volume of the fans is offset by the lack of cooling airflow put out by them. The largest drawback to this product is that my extended battery does not allow for a proper fit on the stand and when placed evenly on the base, the battery covers up most of the cooling fan surface...I do not suggest that this product be purchased by extended battery owners."^3^December 31, 2012

The cooling pad does exactly what it says it will do, which is cool down the laptop, sit it at a great egonomic angle for your hands durng typing and it is very comfortable on your lap. I use it on a laptop stand, that I also purchased at the time I purchased the laptop, most of the time. Although my laptop does get very warm after 8 hours of use or more, I've tried it with and without the cooling pad, and the laptop is a lot cooler with the cooling pad after 8 hours then without it.

The only thing I don't care for is that it now gives my laptop a slight tilt which isn't the optimum thing for me seeing as I am using in while laying in bed, but I can live with that. The one thing to keep in mind is that when you close your laptop it does not shut off the fans. It is USB powered so you have to pull the connection to turn it off."^5^January 2, 2012

iflytoohigh, ^23142475^8^0^"Last Fall of 2014, I had purchased a pre-assembled Cyberpower gaming PC for a rather good price--but, unfortunately some of the included parts are not exactly the top of the line. However, since the entire package was such a good deal, I decided that it'd be a worthwhile investment to simply upgrade some of the different pieces over time.

Having used this PC for a year now with the included noisy stock cooler and dubious heat sink, I decided that it was time to do a mid-tier upgrade. After reading several reviews online, I opted for the CM Hyper 212 EVO; I have been nothing but pleased with this choice!

Let me start off by saying that Walmart shipped this bad boy immensely quickly, and the package arrived with no lumps, bumps, or travel-related wear. Regarding the product, itself--woo boy! The directions are incredibly clear, and the entire package comes with its own thermal paste. I will say that I still personally prefer Arctic Silver's viscosity to the somewhat runny consistency of Cooler Master's thermal paste), but it's getting the job done (and I ran out of my Arctic Silver, so I'll work with what I've got).

For my AMD FX8320, my idling temperature has been reduced from 37C to 22C. When running a game like The Sims 4, my CPU's temperature has dropped from 59C to 43C. Additionally, while running DotA 2 (on the Reborn engine), my temperatures plummeted from 68F to 54F. I think that it's also worth mentioning that this product's included fan is SO quiet. Maybe I'm just jaded from how obnoxiously loud my previous stock cooler's fan was, but I feel like this product's silence is a surprising (and very welcome) blessing. I finally won't wake my neighbors every time I decide to play a game on Steam!

Long story short, this cooler/heatsink is fantastic. Yes, there are probably better tier products out there, but for the low cost... I honestly don't think that you can find a better deal. With a relatively decent thermal paste included, this does a wonderful job of lowering CPU temps and keeping things quiet at the same time. What more could you ask for?

Thanks, Walmart! Great product, greater price!"^5^October 1, 2015
fnich, ^23142475^7^2^"I bought this for my AMD FX8320 which was getting very high temps with the stock Cooler and Heatsink. It was idling at around 30C which isn't too bad but when gaming it would jump up past 70C-79C, after I installed this cooler, it instantly went down to idling around 20C but the biggest improvement was when gaming it now doesn't get past 45C. Everything is the exact same (Same CPU, Room Temp, Same Temp Monitor Program) so even if the sensors are off and those aren't the true temps, The temp difference is huge so I know the cooler is working very well."^5^August 28, 2014
KraigTheGamer, ^23142475^3^1^"I just recently purchased the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO Cooling Fan for my gaming rig. Although I knew the dimensions before I acquired said product, its size alone is a 'Wow factor' in my mind not to mention it's of premium quality. I greatly recommend this product to anyone that is in the market for a quiet, efficient, and high grade aftermarket heat sink. ( But, Don't forget to check the dimensions of this product and compare it with your available space within your rig!;) With that said it's at a reasonable price point for a great quality piece of gaming hardware. As for myself I give it an overall 5/5 star rating.

Clyde, ^23142475^1^0^"Just to give you a little bio on my own rig and purpose, I have a Intel G3258 (LGA 1150 socket) which is on a Mini-ITX board in a Corsair 200r case. I was worried about clearance with all the other components being close to each other around the board, but the heatsink sits well above the graphics card, and the actual fan just clears my ripjaw RAM. Make sure you have at least the width of a Corsair 200r; anything smaller will probably not fit the height of the heatsink

I bought this specific unit for to overclock my unlocked cpu. So far, it has been working great. I got my cpu from 3.2 GHz to 4.4 GHz with the fan keeping my cpu heat down between 50-60 degrees (Intel says max for the cpu should be 72 degrees). The best part is how quiet the fan is at all times. The 212 EVO has a great track record, and it continues its streak in my rig! Walmart was very good with getting the unit delivered on time (two days before actually) to my local store.

Multipel inputs and outputs make this easy. Also a volume control on the Startech gives me more options. The music is much more powerfull than the thru the onboard sound that I blew out on the computer."^4^September 4, 2011

I really needed to fix something I use on daily basis and I had to order this and wait for it because I couldn't find anything similar in any local stores, I think radioshack's website said they had one brand at an actual store but it was a large container which was too much and the price was too high also. When I finally got it I realised I didn't need to do the fix I thought I did and was able to repair it without using the thermal paste so I don't know how well it works. I have somehthing else that needs thermal compound, though so I will be using it as soon as I can find an extra heat sink, and based on what people tell me and what I've read it's pretty good stuff but I think I would also like to try Antec Formula 7 Nano Diamond Thermal Compound.

In case you're wondering I have an i7-5820k. No overclocking yet, but the cooler has given me no complaints.

PrahhhductReevuuuwerrr, ^16685885^0^1^"This power supply worked for exactly what I needed. Recently upgraded the stock graphics card in my HP Elite, so I needed to upgrade my power supply as well. This performs beautifully with no apparent issues. Only thing I can maybe say is that if you have a smaller sized desktop(mid ATX, etc) that you may want to buy the modular version of this power supply as the cables are quite thick and long and the modular(detachable harness) may prove to simplify installation and potentially provide a more tidier setup afterwards. Fit in my case just fine with no issues.

Side Note: Purchasing this plus the two-year ext. warranty was MUCH easier than purchasing from some other popular computer hardware sites. No rebate hassles to worry about...the price is what it says, no horrible customer service with horrible manners, etc. Simply a straightforward easy and honest way to obtain the computer hardware you need, plus the added ease of being able to return it to a store near you if something happens.

If the molex is used, the fan's speed switch sets the speed. The fan runs relatively quietly.

This fan is so easy to set up, very light weight, you can set it anywhere, just amazing! There are no cons to this fan whatsoever! You can use this fan anywhere you need it.

AMSwartz, ^379648059^2^0^"Over forty years, I have a total of seven Vornados in my house. I love the quality that vornado puts in their products and service. About five years ago I called their customer service, as one of my old vornado's started making a little noise. I sent it back and they repaired it and sent it back to me for free. Now after all these years, it still works great, as all my others do. I also have two heaters. I guess I should put these in my will so my children can enjoy them."^5^May 10, 2019
Colorado, ^379648059^1^0^"I purchased two based on previous quality items from Vornado. One of the fans doesn't work on low. Will have to return it. Overall, the fan provides a decent white noise, but does not move very much air even on high setting."^3^August 30, 2018
reneebach, ^379648059^1^1^"This fan is perfect for small spaces and has enough difference between settings to greatly affect the amount of air flow making it perfect for desks with papers or turn it up for a much greater flow of air. My kitchen has a tendency to be warm and this fan has been a great solution. I have limited counter space so its compact design is exactly what I need. I am thinking of buying more for areas in the house that I do not want cluttered with box fans. It's much more quiet than most fans too!

Alannah, ^379648059^1^1^"This fan I have to say is the best little fan. When I received this fan it came very well packaged. After opening it I knew right away this was going to be a great fan. It is very durable and the plastic is very hard. I also like the Mod classic vintage design to it. Gives it a little style which is great for an office or little kids room. I also like how you can aim it up or all the way to the ceiling. Although small and personal size it blows pretty great. It would be wonderful on a desk at an office. I decided to play the adorable little fan in my 1 year old's room. It work wonderful there because we keep it on throughout the night and it the perfect amount of air; not too much, but still a breeze. I also loved putting it in her room, because on high it louder, which creates a muffle noise of us throughout the house. The noise is not over the top, but just right to go to sleep too or help someone go to sleep. I like noise when falling asleep and this is perfect amount of noise. I also wanted to point out there is different settings and I usually keep in medium or high. If you are looking for a small personal fan for a child's room or even one for the office this is it. It is perfect size and it is actually cute! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^5^April 6, 2017
Average Joe, ^379648059^0^1^"This is pretty much a small fan. It does not rotate, but there is a way to pivot the fan. It feels sturdy and high quality. The noise level is about average.

Gmrdude, ^52890676^3^0^"This item makes gaming super fun as there is nothing holding your game back.  If you play FPS's you will find it much easier to play well and come out on top.  However, all games will run super smooth on 1080P and is very good with 1440P.  There is no single card solution for running 4K without sacrificing frame rates.  But make no mistake, this card is capable of running 4K with no problem.  I myself run this card with 1080P resolution and the card gets 130-185  Frames per second in UItra easily on every game available including DOOM.  Well worth the price of admission!"^5^November 9, 2017
Skyler, ^52890676^2^0^"One of the best cards available and as of this review it's at a great price for the performance [599.00].

Using MSI Afterburner and running some benchmarks my card is able to run at max load for 20 minutes before it reaches 70C fans disabled stock clocks.

With fans at 50% I'm able to get a solid 1900 mhz on the core and 10000 mhz on memory for 75C stress test. I can push the core to 2100 but the temps push near 90C with fans at 100%. Gaming loads almost never max out a good card however.

Far Cry Primal 1440p Ultra 120 fps high 90 fps low. Fallout 4 1440p Ultra 60 fps no drops. GTA 5 1440p Ultra 100 fps high 75 fps low. It's capable of 4k 60 fps but you have to drop AA quite a bit.

These results will vary based on your build clocks and airflow."^5^May 17, 2018

The price was about 20% less expensive than competitors, not counting shipping. The nearest PC parts store is 45 minutes away. I set up my customers machine with my own known good power supply and ordered this one.
I always have parts shipped (FREE) to my favorite Walmart store. I know the confirmation sometimes says 7-10 days to arrive. I would say the actual time is 3-4 days.
Upon arrival found it to be exactly what was ordered, with two Sata connections that were needed. It booted the machine in nice fashion.

BrianH, ^55428266^1^0^"You've got the power of an i3 at half the cost.

Pair it with an RX480 and you've got yourself a high end budget build. 

Definitely good enough to play most games even today at high to max settings. For under $300 combined to boot, you just can't beat it.

Only bad thing is, make sure you have a newer motherboard as older 1151 boards do not support Kaby Lake right out of the box. I got extremely lucky on my mobo purchase that this worked without having to update. Had my Skylake on the side just incase too.

If you can find it in stock, buy it. Worth every penny."^5^March 9, 2017
Stingray2012, ^15540328^3^3^"I found this card being of interest, easy to connect to the PC. Among the X-Fi cards, I strongly recommend this card to a friend. You can listen to the good sound and input with a mic with a microphone boost so as your mic input is not to be swallowed by the music loudness that probably happened to the rest of the X-Fi cards.

While this PSU is one of the quieter ones I've installed, it's efficiency of 65% leaves something to be improved upon.

Knew that it wasn't the power supply as the battery indicator was always lit, and after cooling for fifteen minutes with a fan bowing across the laptop and the vents, the laptop was able to be restarted. checking the battery state in the system properties, it was fully charged and every other indication was normal.
From the moment I set up the cooling fan, a simple 5 minute task, including opening opening and discarding the packaging, I have had no further problems. 
As I am on a fixed income of $1200 per month, and since having two strokes am unable to drive, I depend on my 5 year old Acer laptop for communications and entertainment.Finding this fan and buying it was the best thing I have done in 18 yrs online!"^5^December 14, 2016

DaLanMan, ^22663860^1^0^"Turns out the on-board sound on my 400$ mb was garbage. I ordered new headphones and a new soundcard, the headphones went to my fiance and the old turtlebeach headphones I have had here for ages are still here, they sound 5-10x better with the new soundcard.

If you are not using discrete audio and you like music and or sound in general, you should definitely upgrade."^5^September 27, 2014
MGB2, ^22663860^1^0^"Overall, it's a great sound card. It's an improvement over the onboard sound that came with my computer, even though that was advertised as being very good. The Sound Blaster Z makes the music come alive. I think it will sound even better someday if I upgrade to better speakers.

But there were some problems at first which I was able to fix. For one thing, even though I had the speakers at a moderate volume level, my ears hurt after listening for a while. I had never had this problem with these speakers before. So I double-clicked the 'SB' icon in the bottom right of the Windows screen. After looking around, I clicked the 'SBX Pro Studio' button on the left and moved the 'Bass' slider left to reduce the bass. That took care of the problem. Eventually I unchecked 'Bass' to completely remove the extra bass and was happy with the result.

Another problem I noticed right away was when I was playing some music that also had a voice speaking. I could tell there was something wrong, and after looking around some more, under 'Speakers/Headphones' I noticed it said '5.1 Surround'. Since I have an Altec Lansing 2.1 speaker system, I changed it to 'Stereo' and the problem went away. There's also a choice for 'Stereo direct', but I haven't read the manual to see whether that would work better."^5^November 23, 2013

It's hard to tell whether it is actually transferring heat to the sink, but my quess is that it does. I think the only downfall of this paste is that it dry sooo quickly. You can only use a very small amount at a time. Any batch whipped up that is not used in 3 min. is unusable. Case in point, make your batches small.

gpmitchell, ^20449152^2^0^"Kind of hard to find in stores....order it online its easier...if you need a permanent adhesive to connect a heatsink to a large flat chip on your motherboard this is a great product do not use this on your main CPU use the grease with the clamp downs instead. heatsink aim of my video chip and there is no clamps to hold it down looks like they put on some kind of grease at the factory instead of an adhesive like this and the heatsink fell off!

ElectronicsDork, ^20449152^1^0^"If you're looking to glue heat sinks to semiconductors this is just what you need. Sets in about 10 minutes and drys as hard as a rock in 24 hours.

Once the heat sink is glued on you'll never get it off again, so if this isn't what you want to do you will need one of Arctic Silver's other products."^5^June 17, 2014

CaptBanana, ^20449152^0^1^"Pros:
- Cheap thermal adhesive, great for permanent fixing such as mounting heat sinks to the VRAM of a graphics card or mounting heat sinks to a Raspberry Pi. However, I'd advise against using it on your computer processor because it is PERMANENT, as in you'll break your CPY or motherboard pulling off your cooler.
- Ceramic, so it's not electrically conductive like silver is.
Cons:
- PERMANENT (well, this is by design)
- Only 5G of product, meaning 2.5G in each shringe (they are mixed for the solution in a 1:1 ratio)
- SHIPPING SHIPPING SHIPPING
My issue with the shipping is as follows; The shipping cost more than the item itself, and while it has tracking it is EXTREMELY SLOW and expensive... all to have it show up in an envelope almost 2 weeks after ordering. The heat sinks for my raspberry Pi already came in so I fixed them to the Pi using Arctic Silver 5, which isn't permanent so i'm testing how well it holds the heatsinks on."^3^February 1, 2014
Jtall, ^29503759^1^0^"I bought this to make a stirplate for home brewing beer. This worked like a charm. The speed control works well. I found it works best to turn the power all the way down with the fan un plugged, place the flask or jar on the stirplate with the spin magnet centered and plug it in. I can turn the power  up once it's going, but too high and it will throw the magnet.

RonG1952, ^10104879^1^0^"Works well as a system fan, the only thing I notice is it comes with a switch to control the speed of the fan. My bios do this for me but the only way they could control this one is if I set it on high. So a bit of a waste to have the switch attached to the fan, besides you need to tie it down so it does not end up in the blades the cord on it is so short it dangles right next to them."^5^June 8, 2015

Hetzelhaus, ^37494604^4^1^"I bought the MDA 200 to use in conjunction with my Phonak hearing aids and the Phonak ComPilot. The ComPilot links well with other devices, but not when paired with the MDA 200. Almost every call I answer over the MDA200 is dropped within 30 seconds...So not only did I waste money buying the device, I lose sales from customers who don't call back. I assume that the problem is with Plantronics since I had the same issue with a different brand of hearing aid when used with their Voyager.

The building is brand new, but the A/C in the building has a very hot climate to compete with and windows all the way around the building. This fan has a 6 inch blade and you can definitely tell the difference between mine and others around me who have a little, single speed 4' fan. You cannot tell if the 4' fan is working unless you are really close to it....glad I didnt wast my money on it. The BDP-700 by Black and Decker is an awesome fan. I have shopped other sites and Walmart has the best price. I shipped it to the store and it was there in 5 days. I am a person who sweats easily and this is just what I was looking for. It doesn't take up much space, the cord is long enough I dont have to figure out where to put it. I already have co-workers who want to get one as soon as I show mine off."^5^September 6, 2012

This fan is used as a 24 hour low speed exhaust fan in the window of the closet space we use as a dedicated room for our 2 cats. They spend the evenings there, and their litter boxes are in there, thus the 24 hour venting.

1. Ppppppst to water cooling, with this you don't need no stinking water.
2. It's big, and it cools great, it's quiet for the most part and is a sleek colour.
3. Arrived on time, all the way to Guam.

CON:

1. Still the hardest part of doing a PC build. The brackets are a pain to get installed, but read the directions a FEW TIMES and you'll get it.
2. Throw away the extra parts.
3. LED light is blue, could have sworn I read it was red, Oh well, still looks nice.

OTHER:

1. Keep the plastic wrap around the fins until it's installed so you don't bend them, then once installed, snip, snip.

Timmo, ^10242734^3^3^"Love it. Bought for travel but found a job for it at home as a bridge between the wireless network and the home theater receiver. Card locks snug in laptop port with no issues. Plenty of sound quality options in control panel to get just the right effect. Great for playing off of the external drive or streaming Rhapsody. The wireless network connection is, on rare occasions, the weak link if bad signal strength. I have no other product to compare this to but it still deserves 5 stars. You won't be sorry."^5^December 31, 2009
DadHit, ^10242734^3^0^"Bought this for my Inspiron 1525. Audio performance is good, but it kept cutting out because it does not stay securely in the expresscard slot (does not seem to catch firmly, so the slighest touch or even just bumping the laptop caused it to come out just enought to cut power/connection). Also not sure why they cut back on performance on this one, as it is 24-Bit/48kHz, while its predecessor was 24-Bit/96kHz."^3^June 29, 2009

jazz57, ^10242734^1^4^"This card makes my laptop sound almost as good as a cd player when connected to my home theater setup. Alot of this is accomplished by the x-fi crystalizer that provides impact restoration to percussion instruments, giving the sound a more live presence. I have Itunes, Pandora, and Jazz fm web stations. I'm retired and listen to a lot of music, so I'm really enjoying this. As far as headphone listening, I don't use them, so don't know how this card sounds with them. IMO, you can't go wrong with this card.
I have read some reviews that state 'card won't stay in slot'. I used the adaptor that came with it for my 54mm slot and have had no problems. Try it, you'll like it."^5^August 5, 2009

GamesoulMaster, ^13907672^3^0^"There isn't a whole lot to say about this power supply. I bought it about 6 months ago, and it's performed flawlessly so far. It runs pretty quiet and cool. Although as a low power, high efficiency power supply from a (fairly) reputable company, this is to be expected.

Currently, it's powering two 7200 RPM hard drives, an Intel dual core processor, a Radeon 5670 graphics card, CD/DVD burner, and various USB devices, and it still runs stable. Voltages are steady, no hiccups or issues.

Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this power supply. It's a great choice for anybody who isn't running a high end graphics card and/or a power hungry 125+W AMD processor."^5^January 11, 2011

chiefaics, ^13907672^0^3^"For the non-technical person, this PSU turns on and allows the computer power up. However, because many of the voltage settings are way out of tolerance, a) it doesn't have enough juice to power my computer case fan, plus if I use it for too long, there is a possibility that those out of tolerance voltages can damage my computer while frying itself sooner rather than later. This is the second Antec PSU that I have bought, and both were barely working and out of specs. So I guess what many are saying about Antec, it true: They used to put out great quality, but now they have sunk to an new low."^1^August 26, 2013

MooMom, ^5533603^14^0^"This fan is great because if the power is out - no problem, it comes with built-in rechargeable batteries. What if they wear out? No problem, you can pop in your own batteries. What if you don't have any more batteries? No problem, you can recharge it or run it from the cigarette lighter in your car (it comes with the adapter). What if the power is not out and you just need a fan? No problem, it comes with a cord to plug it in like a regular fan. This fan has all the bases covered. Gotta love it.

MindfulShopper, ^5533603^6^0^"What would happen if your power went out in your home? Would would you do to cool you and your family members during extreme hot temperatures? The Pivoting Rechargeable 10' fan is the answer to those questions. During a hot night just use one of these units and have it circulating air around you for your comfort. I use the O2-Cool fan and have bought several in emegencies, especially during long hot summer weather. I would recommend this to anyone. I gave it an overall rating of 4 stars for two reasons: (1) I would like to see a bigger version say 12-15', and (2) Manufacturer boasts up to 72 hours of battery life but that is just on its lowest setting under perodic on/off use.

I only use once in the fall for leaf cleanup, probably have less than 10 hrs over a two year period. Wouldn't start this year so changed plug, gas, cleaned air filter and removed and cleaned carburetor. Now it starts great but won't run at full throttle, no high speed fuel adjustment.

solstice53, ^37467980^17^0^"As others have already pointed out already, this product is terrible. Out of the box, it was under-powered even when it ran well. Then in subsequent seasons, it became increasingly hard to start -- and the choke lever could only be babied up to position 2, never 3. After it warmed up, the engine would spurt encouragingly to full speed momentarily and then the motor would sputter and die out.

bobsledjim, ^37467980^15^1^"Based on other reviews, my experience is similar. After using a few times the carburetor gets out of adjustment, it gets harder to start and it runs worse and worse with each use. I took it to a service center and it was due to the carburetor getting out of adjustment. They adjusted it and it only took a few uses to get out of adjustment again. The adjustment takes a special carb wrench but noone seems to sell them. I believe it is referred to as a 'pacman' wrench due to its shape. The guy at the service center said the manufacturer doesn't want people to have the wrench because they don't want it being adjusted wrong and have the engine burn up."^1^April 15, 2015

GrampaC, ^37467980^11^0^"For many years, we used nothing but rakes and sometimes an electric blower to collect our leaves. The electric blower was hand held and the thrust focused onto our lower backs.

This unit is quite the opposite. It is small and light weight. It is worn on your back and everything is centered. We can walk upright and straight. The blower tube with throttle control handle represents no noticeable torsional forces to our backs, therefore, we can use it comfortably for as long as needed.

Overall, this is a great little machine (however, I'm requesting a new primer bulb for mine). I would give this item a 99.5% review!"^5^November 3, 2015

Only thing i had to adjust the second year is the throttle as the set screws vibrated a little bit and lost some of my full throttle again simple. Do not do any type of winter storage pull it out and fires up first pull every time. Once warmed up i can even pull start it on my back with not even 1/2 pull.

Buffaloe, ^37467980^6^0^"And I'm not talking a few drips, I'm talking a steady stream. I didn't notice this until I had it for a few months, but I took it to a friends house to help him out. I started with a full tank and arrived with almost no gas in the tank. It's always been hard to start. I have to push the primer bulb about 20 times, half choke, and it will start and run fine after about five pulls. It doesn't leak gas in the wearing position because the tank opening is tilted upward, but if you lay it down, out comes the gas. I've tried three different caps and it still streams gas if not perfectly upright. Not a bad unit really, except for the gas leak. I've learned to live with it but it's a total PITA."^2^June 17, 2017

MountainRob, ^37467980^2^0^"The power generated by this Troy-Bilt Leaf Blower is impressive.  So impressive, that we purchased two identical machines - one for this writer and one for this writer's spouse.  Our home is in a  heavily wooded area of the Appalachians.  When fall season occurs one can expect tons of hardwood leaves to cascade downward concealing every square inch of our property.  What took two weeks by conventional rake and lots of arm power, can now be performed in two to three days.  The Troy-Bilt engine works with regular unleaded fuel eliminating the nuisance of mixing oil with gasoline and having a separate fuel storage container.  Besides the power to blow an accumulation of leaves knee high, the machine is designed to be comfortably balanced when placed on one's back.  We use the backpack blowers for up to six hours at one time.  As recommended by Troy-Bilt, users are encouraged to wear protection devices on ears and eyes."^4^July 16, 2018

This backpack gas leaf blower is nice in that the weight is evenly distributed across your back so your hand and back don't get tired. performance: it gets the job done and fairly easy to start for beginner.

Marsh123, ^37467980^1^0^"My husband was super excited when we received the Troy-built leafblower. This model in particular was smaller and lightweight so it was easy for me as well as my husband to use but was still powerful enough to clean off my sidewalk [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"^2^June 26, 2018
MiltonLee, ^37467980^1^0^"This is my first backpack blower, and being a Troy Bilt customer for life of course it's the one I bought. 4 cycle engine is great. Worked great out of the box, easy to assemble,  easy to use. I use this blower often, my yard, my mother in laws yard and my church yard. The controls are easy to use, quick starting comfortable to wear."^5^July 10, 2018

JG, ^23143628^1^0^"A review? Ok, it works. how's that?
Be careful on the wiring. I called tech support just to make sure I could connect 'red' with 'white' on my Symmerta 8KVA unit, because the plugs did not match up. But after going over that with APC support it was easily connected and it works fine."^5^April 13, 2010

Andrew, ^830037096^7^2^"The picture shown and the model number provided in the product details clearly state that the item is the boxed version of the 6700k. To my disappointment, I received a tray version. Gonna keep it cause I need it for my build, but let it be known that this is a TRAY processor, and not what the model number indicates."^2^March 13, 2017
