auntbelindy, ^43770441^12^0^"Great coloring book of cats in different scenes. Beautiful tiffany lamp w/a cat sitting all dressed up in a big chair is one of the pictures. I was very pleased as I am a cat person. That's why I bought this book."^5^December 8, 2015
sportstercutie, ^43770441^10^0^"5+ This book is just simply awesome! The pics are very creative and sooooo detailed. If using the extra fine point sharpies or another coloring marker, they will bleed a little due to the small but defining art. I am so happy with this book!!! Even if you are not a cat lover, you won't be disappointed...."^5^December 31, 2015

John, ^44979555^1^0^"This is a fantastic set of postcards of Disney animated films. This package covers about 25 years of Disney's recent history, from 'The Little Mermaid' in 1989 to 'Big Hero 6' in 2014 (complete list of movies at the bottom of review).

Each card measures approximately 3.75 x 5.75 inches (9.5 x 14 cm). The front of each card features a piece of artwork from the film(s) The back is indeed in the style of a standard postcard, with a few lines for the address as well as a place for the postage stamp.

The art is absolutely fantastic, ranging from near-completed designs to the earliest character sketches. Much of the imagery should be very recognizable for fans of the Disney movies.

List of Movies (there are 10 postcards for each):
- Little Mermaid
- Beauty and the Beast
- Aladdin
- The Lion King
- Mulan
- Princess and the Frog
- Tangled
- Wreck-It Ralph
- Frozen
- Big Hero 6"^5^October 1, 2015

Snaidirolf, ^1440000^1^0^"I find this book very good for myself since I have some musical education on guitar. Being able to read basic music is getting me through it self taught.

Ivorytickler1936, ^4300800^24^1^"This music instruction system is the best foundational training for anyone of any age to get the most important send off for a music life of enrichment and enjoyment. I am 76 years old and startedwith this book when I was 7. I was in love with music. By age 10 or 11 I was playing for our church. When I was almost out of my teen years, I furnished the wedding music for my third music teacher and her husband. I play the piano, the piano doesn't play me. I credit the confidence I got from the start in this book as well as the rest of the books in the course for what I consider a successful music life. I don't want to leave God out of the equasion, because He allowed this success to happen. I have only played church related music all my life."^5^July 22, 2012

Wildmonkey3, ^33940493^42^0^"I was so excited when I received this coloring book. The pictures are beautiful, and I feel like I am making a masterpiece when I color them. There are very few adult coloring books out there that show scenery as well as this book does. Well worth the money, although the price is very reasonable for what you receive....."^5^December 8, 2015
Charm43, ^33940493^17^1^"Woo-hoo! Finally, a coloring book with scenery and animals to color! I got tired of the repetitious coloring books that had wallpaper-type patterns, stained glass and paisley designs, or nothing but flowers on the pages. I wanted objects that I could use shading (of my own) without so much black ink from the artists pen. Now I can do sky, trees, animals, buildings, plants and flowers in a scene that I can do all of the shading myself. Love this. Will buy more of this type of coloring book!"^5^March 28, 2016
MeAndTheCat, ^33940493^16^0^"It has nice pictures but not what I was looking for. I wanted more like the one on the cover and woods and ponds, etc. This book had too many barns, farm scenes and such. It stills deserves 5 stars and will make lots of customers happy, I am sure.

I do wish Walmart would let us see a few pages of the books , to make our choices less of a hit or miss purchase. Other sites give customers a peek inside. I ended up returning 2 of my purchases, but the process was quick and painless. To anyone shopping for adult coloring books for the first time on line, Walmart does have a great variety of subjects and an extensive collection!"^5^April 2, 2016
4grandsons, ^33940493^15^0^"This is not the everyday run of the mill adult coloring book.  Every book I have seen is that artsy stuff.  I don't want stained glass, fish, spirals, or squigglies.  This book has about 31 pictures and the sheets are perforated for easy removal if you want.  It is similar to notebook paper but a heavier stock.  Very detailed pictures that are very outdoorsy.  I liked this so much I sent one to each of my 2 sisters and just got another one this week for a friend.  Never thought I would be interested in coloring.  Thought I had outgrown it.  I had a magazine with one sheet in it and I tried it.  I find it to be very relaxing and soothing so I do it every night before going to bed.  My sister agrees with me and she is a very nervous person.  The one I got for my friend is because she has a lot of sleepless nights and my other sister has dementia.  I am hoping this helps them all."^5^September 2, 2016

savvyshopper, ^33940493^3^0^"There were a few pages that I colored but, for the most part, there was too much really small detail and really bad perspective--the flowers were bigger than the fence they were growing on.

HopeL, ^4979461^3^0^"The lesions in the book were disappointing in that they were far more advanced than the title implied. I bought this book for a middle grade student because the It he title states it is a beginner's level,. But the instructions and lessons seemed difficult, even for an adult. This is one of those times when buying in person would have been better. Or perhaps, the ad should have show a couple of pages from the inside of the book ths demonstrate the 'beginner's level' they are talking about. It seemed rather advanced to me!"^3^December 26, 2014

They like these classics along with pop hits. They each picked a few songs that they asked their teacher to cover. My only complaint is often repeated by many before me - it's too tough to keep open while playing without really wrestling with it. Hopefully that won't compromise the binding long term. It's annoying to have to figure out a creative way to keep this book open."^4^January 24, 2014

88keys, ^13980875^1^0^"My First Piano Adventure for the Young Beginner: Lessons Book and its companion Writing Book were designed to appeal to children ages 5 and 6. I have used it with 7-yr.-old students, too. It is different than other method books and takes some time to get familiar with the activities and their purposes, but teachers can go online for instruction and video examples.

The book states, 'The Lesson and Writing Book introduces directional pre-reading, elementary music theory and technique with engaging songs, games, and creative discovery at the keyboard.'

My students like the colorful illustrations and activities that give them a chance to move. As a piano teacher,  I am very impressed with the results. The students who complete Book A, B, and C  have great technique, sight-reading and listening skills. They are well-prepared to move into the regular Piano Adventure series starting with Level 1 instead of Primer."^5^September 29, 2016

nondisclosed, ^5509986^1^0^"This book makes playing Ukulele ('Uke') simple and fun.   It makes me fall in love with my first Ukulele!

The book's method is unique!  It does not overwhelm you, a beginner student, with too much music theory.  It does not intimidate you with complicated chords.  Instead, it starts you on learning simple music notes and how to trump them on the Uke.  After 15 minutes, you can play 2 or 3 simple songs on its first lesson and you feel wonderful ! :)"^5^July 3, 2017

starwars7659lucas, ^22907069^17^4^"Keep 'em coming! These LEGO movies are really great, I'd just like to see a longer one. The Padawan Menace and the Empire Strikes Out are each only 22 minutes long! I think LEGO should stop trying to change how some of the characters should look. Han Solo and Chewbacca especially look really weird.

Personally, I'd say the screaming girl fans were a fail. It takes too much from Luke's mission. Also, it's just really annoying. I DID think it was kind of funny when one of them brought out an original Star Wars lunch box, those are getting pretty rare now.

The Darth Vader minifigure is just his regular self but with a medal that the Emperor awards to him at the end of the movie. Then Vader slaps a stormtrooper on the back who falls over, causing a chain reaction that causes a whole regiment of troopers to fall over like dominoes, while Darth Maul is being chased by the screaming fans. That part's pretty epic.

My favorite part is when Maul says 'awesome' over and over again with the tune from his battle with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. I love that choir song."^4^March 30, 2013

John, ^10725022^1^0^"'The Big Book of Drawing Secrets' is an excellent book covering everything one could possibly need to know about sketching.  As it was written by two professional FBI--contractor sketch artists, I would expect nothing less!  

The book begins with an introduction to and recommendations for all the tools you need for drawing successfully.  Next comes an overview of the different approaches and effects, finally, you get a step by step, illustrated guide to follow.

Now for me, I would call myself an advanced beginner.  My landscapes come out alright, but anything in three dimensions is awful.  I bought this book hoping for progress and inspiration:-):-):-)

I highly recommend this book to any artist, beginner or advanced...or anywhere in between.  The book is a wealth of information that will only make your drawing easier and better.

THEDDLE, ^10337816^1^0^"I bought this book because of reviews on it and I was wanting a starting point for the basics on what supplies are recommended for using colored pencils. The book was the cheapest I found on the internet. This includes the free store pickup. Shipping at other sites would have been more. I have not read the entire book but went through it. Seems like a lot of good information to get to know. It may not be an all time how to or reference guide for more advanced people. I am not sure; however, for someone not knowing anything it is a good starting point; especially for the price.

ignawms, ^19334604^5^2^"The description was not immediately clear what it included when I made the purchase. This is a set with a book and the deck of cards. I love the cards. The images are awesome. The cards are thinner, more like normal playing cards and easier to shuffle although they are still over-sized. The images are clear and beautiful. The book has tips, tricks, spreads and meanings. It shows a black and white photograph of each card with a good description of its meaning. The book is excellent for a beginner. I would have given this 5 stars, but the box is flimsy and the smaller box inside that contained the cards is too big for the cards and also flimsy. It's not really a good box in which to store the cards. I will likely not be retaining either of the boxes. Definitely recommended."^4^September 6, 2014

Conny, ^732339010^1^0^"O Lord, thank You for Your shelter in the storm. I need it! I rest in You, Lisa Ham writes as a prayer overlapping a photograph in her book, Devotions from the Mountains.

~ What ~
At two-hundred-twenty-four hundred pages, this hardbound book targets those who love the mountains as they relate to God. Using mainly the New International Version of the Holy Bible, also referenced are the AMP, ESV, KJV, and NASB. A green ribbon marker is attached.

After an ownership page and table of contents, this book contains ninety devotions, each one being one to one to five pages with beautiful full-color photographs of mountains, streams, lakes, trees, and wildlife scenes. Beginning with a title and written Bible verse underneath it, several paragraphs relate to the topic regarding mountainous nature. A short prayer ends each chapter.

~Why ~
I appreciate devotionals that have little information about the author but focus on God in nature, and this book does that. The stories are brief and to the point, correlating to God and His grace, love, beauty, and creativity. Old and New Testament verses are included.

A favorite was Motorboats and Canoes with the verse of Matthew 11:28-30 written out. The discussion is about the differences in types of the boats and their uses, mentioning how we zip along in life on a motorboat but need rest and quiet a canoe offers. The writer challenges the reader to seek similar peace in prayer and meditation. The prayer thanks God for rest and His kindness and gentleness.

~ Why Not ~
Those who do not have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ may not want to get a book that focuses on getting closer to the Almighty. Others may wish there were more than ninety devotions included. I found the devotions are not in depth.

~ Wish ~
With the stunning photographs throughout the book, it draws away from the writing, so I may be one of the few that wish there were less artwork if it is meant to be more of a devotional than a gift book. Since I live in the Pacific Northwest and recognize some of the mountain ranges, I wish the photographs' locations were labeled.

~ Want ~
If you like devotionals with beautiful photographs and short reading, this is an excellent choice for someone who loves the outdoors and mountains. It would make a beautiful addition to a cabin or bed-and-breakfast bookcase or bedside table.

I am under no obligation to review this complimentary book."^4^November 1, 2017

Loondoo, ^1061418^2^0^"The best Beatles chord book for jams and singalongs.

Most songs are arranged so that there is no page turning required--something essential during acoustic Beatle jams or singalong where you simply want to key in on chords and lyrics and not have to worry about turning pages in the middle of a song.

The only slight negative is that as is, the book won't lay flat or open to the page you'd like unless you have a music stand or book holder handy.

An easy solution is to have Walmart or Staples remove the spine and replace it with a ring binding, only costs a few bucks but is worth every penny!"^5^March 23, 2014

The CDs are a fun addition, as the songs without the CDs or accompaniments are kind of plain. I thought if he could make it through at least part one and two I would get him professional lessons this summer. This is a great starter and very easy to follow. I also looked up some videos on you tube for finger position and posture as this book has limited information on the topics. Also without the CD's its hard to keep the time so you might download a metranome app on your phone or ipad this helped my son keep steady time as he played without the CDs."^5^January 15, 2014
CuteEverythingcom, ^47140255^2^0^"I've practiced several styles of calligraphy in years past, but it's been quite a while since I've attempted it and instead have switched over to digital design. When I saw Simply Calligraphy, I thought it would be nice to brush up on some of the simple basics and I also wanted to improve my day-to-day handwriting as well. In the book, a simple, clean italic is featured, one that I was able to easily follow and practice. I bought a new pen with several nibs and have been showing my daughter what angle to hold the pen and how to create lovely letters. I liked how the author included numbers for each stroke and I love the simple flourishes and ornaments used for decoration.

Live2Worship, ^2443850^5^0^"'The Real Book' has some history behind it that is not normally found in the product description. For example, this product, the SIXTH edition, is the only LEGAL 'Real Book'. In fact, all prior editions were not legal, because the publisher didn't actually receive permission to use each of the songs. The bad news is that when the 6th edition was created, permission could not be obtained for many of the tunes in the 5th edition, and therefore were omitted, while others which could be, were added.

The unfortunate truth is that in the real world of JAZZ, when you get together with seasoned pros, they don't even think about there being such as thing as a legal 6th edition, because 'it just doesn't have all the songs'. So, you show up at the gig, and they immediately call a tune which YOU DON'T HAVE in your brand spankin' new 6th edition. At that point, they grimmace and either play it without you, or begrudgingly pick another tune. What's even more confusing, is that if you DO find the tune, it may in fact be in a different key or have different chord changes than the 5th edition, so once again, you're not having as much fun as you thought you would.

On a practical note, I personally find the comb binding to be really cheesy and hard to work with. How much more could a spiral binding cost? In fact, they're out there, but you have to be willing to pay twice the price.

For those who having actually seen inside one of these books, note that all of the tunes are done in 'chicken scratch' format instead of nicely formatted sheet music. If you want something that looks good, my personal favorite is 'The Ultimate Jazz Fakebook'.

For students wanting to learn jazz, there is simply NO substitute for Volumes 1 - 125 of the Jamey Aebersold Play-a-Long series. Each book contains nicely made sheet music for 'C', 'Bb' and 'Eb' instuments, plus bass. They also include discographies to help you find the oringal recordings so you can hear what they're really supposed to sound like.

Lastly, I would like to put in a 'thumbs up' for PG Music's Band-in-a-Box software, which includes the entire real book, and is another excellent resource for learning jazz."^4^November 2, 2010

Ebony, ^53598232^1^0^"If I could give it zero stars I would.  I bought this for my daughter who loves to draw hoping that it would have some how to sketches in it...wrong! It has ZERO pictures and only talks about what to do if you like to draw i.e. 'take your work seriously '. Don't waste your money. I returned this as soon as I could. If you want to read a comic size book about things most serious artist know purchase this book."^1^December 6, 2017
^4406722^9^4^"I was expecting it to come with a CD to assist you not just a read along. Most Guitar books come with a play along CD so all I can do is hope I get it right. It was pretty disappointing"^3^March 20, 2008

McQueen3D3, ^3618252^2^0^"This is a huge book, probably worth twice what I paid for it at the time. It is quite generously illustrated in full color. Most of the Wright home designs that were built are in here, and you will enjoy the pictures that give you the gist of the design, but no floor plans. However, it is a very high quality book and the illustrations are tasty eye candy and almost from cover to cover so I was very pleased with what I got. Great for anyone with an interest in residential architecture."^5^August 30, 2013
ninehall, ^28379256^5^0^"I got to see this movie early before it's official release and it is outstanding! We need more family friendly films like this one and I applaud the producers for making a film that everyone in the family can watch and enjoy! A Season of Miracles is a must add for your home movie collection."^5^September 10, 2013
sherrikw, ^28379256^1^0^"The friendship between Rafer (Grayson Russell) and Zack (Andrew Wilson Williams) is at the heart of this story that touches on current issues like autism and bullying. The movie is entertaining; happy and at times, heart-wrenching. The entire baseball team and the adults actors deliver masterful performances of Rusty Whiteners amazing novel, 'A Season of Miracles.' This is a movie that is not to be missed."^5^September 19, 2013
DGJeff, ^28379256^1^0^"An inspiring family movie with timeless lessons of faith, family and friendship best describe this new movie based on the Rusty Whitener novel of the same name. These fun-loving kids teach us all how to be witnesses of our faith through simply being kind to one another! This story also addresses the issue of bullying today as the kids on the Robins baseball team invite a boy with autism to join their team and find out the lessons he teaches them become enduring ones. This makes a great choice for family movie night, for church youth groups or kids' Sunday School classes. I highly recommend you get it today!!"^5^October 3, 2013
DaHud, ^28379256^0^1^"This is the most wonderful story. I loved the book and can't wait to see the rest of the movie. It's family friendly and has some great teaching moments for all ages."^5^September 19, 2013
FooFightersRock, ^23339820^2^0^"Reel to Reel is how music should be recorded. Dave Grohl and many legendary musicians do a great job of explaining that. Check out the legendary LA recording studio. An excellent documentary with some kick butt music."^5^January 9, 2015
wmdude1255, ^1079517^6^0^"Watching these brought back memories. I remember
when many of these were airing on Vh1 in the early
90's. All of these will be remembered especially the
ones for 'Freedom 90' 'Faith' 'Too Funky' 'Father Figure' and 'Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me'. They will never be forgotton. I give this collection
a 10. If you've never heard of George Michael's music,
this is an excellent introduction."^5^January 29, 2010
Skeibler, ^1079517^4^1^"Any time I want something to make me feel good watching this does the trick. I really hope they will come out with some of the older stuff now...
a Wham! music video DVD.
But with the bonus interview of George Michael on the BBC in this DVD...could any fan ask for more?"^5^July 12, 2007

TheAnimatingAnimal, ^14704432^0^1^"This book may be frustrating for beginning artists. However, if you are already into character design or want to branch out into the Furry art world; this book is excellent. It will help polish existing hand rendering skills and shows the thought and design processes used by some other artists.

It's excellent for pro artists to help stay on top of their game in between projects. It also shows little tricks that other artists have developed in the industry to make proportional details easier and faster. A good artist never stops creating, observing and learning."^5^December 29, 2013

XxxyzXzyxx, ^45144160^6^1^"These Adult coloring books are a new trend and a great way to relieve stress, anxiety & an opportunity to slow down a bit on a hectic day. This is a book for adults as the pictures are extremely detailed and cannot be finished in one sitting. You really want take your time spending your quiet time enjoying a favorite past time activity!

Great buy with many many hours of coloring ahead of you! I definitely recommend it!"^5^January 27, 2016

Yuukineko, ^3660106^19^2^"I definitely recommend this to any of my fellow manga/anime artists. I absolutely love it. It's the best thing ever. This also has how to create/edit your drawings in Photoshop. But I could be wrong. I had it for years but it started falling apart so I gave it away to a friend. Anyways, I just order a new one cause it's the best How to/Guide book I've ever had. I have Manga for Dummies also and it's a wonderful, informative book. But it's mostly just reading. So I think this one's is way better. Just my opinion of course. <3 Also this has a few surrealism creatures like bugs and stuff in it too. Shows you how to draw a ton of stuff...."^5^July 17, 2011
