In the book it shows you what the holocaust is ,and it's really a big thing about history that everyone needs to know so that somthing like this wouldn't happen in future refrences. I am 14 of years and I really don't enjoy reading but i like this book because it shows how,what,were,and how they felt about the holocaust and to know that anne Frank left this dairy. if she didn't we wouldn't know so much about the Holocaust."^5^March 28, 2010
Phone86, ^404994^5^0^"I read this book back in high school and it has become one of my favorites since then.

WorldTraveler2904, ^2191247^1^0^"I was one of the 'Plane People' who was on their way home to the US on 9/11- when we were diverted to Canada, due to the attacks on our country and the closure of US airspace.

Thirty something jumbo jets landed at Gander, Newfoundland.

Gander, a small town, rallied to the cause and 'threw open their doors' to us. They knew our country had been injured and we were hurting as well. They did everything in their power to comfort us and provide assistance.

From, offering the use of their phones, to cooking meals for us, to opening their homes so we could sleep and shower, to driving us around town- the word 'no' simply did not exist in their vocabulary during that week!

Many of us actually walked away from this experience with guilt. Our country had been attacked by the most evil, vile actors in the world.- and it was hurting We on the other hand, found ourselves surrounded by the most caring, loving folks we had probably ever encountered. It was the greatest contrast possible!

Upon parting, they refused to accept any money, or gifts in appreciation for what they had done for us. They just said 'We can't. You would do the same for us, it was our pleasure'.

A truly uplifting 9/11 story about our neighbors to the north. Thank you again, for all that you did for all of us that came to you as strangers- but departed as friends!"^5^September 13, 2013

TheDailyWalk, ^15932791^3^0^"I first heard about Bonheoffer a couple of months ago in a class that was being given at church. A lot of his philosophies where discussed and when I saw his biography being offered for review form Thomas Nelson I jumped at the opportunity to dive deeper into his life.

New York Times best-selling author Eric Metaxas provides a very detailed account of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's epic life. From page one to five hundred forty-two Metaxas fully engulfs you in the life and times of Bonhoeffer. This book takes your from his early childhood to his involvement in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and ultimately to his execution. Along the way you learn holf Bonheoffer's life shapes his theology and development of the Confessing Church.

I was not disappointed with this book at all. I feel that it is a great book for anyone who calls themselves a Christian should read. It is a story of someone who was not afraid to pay the ultimate price for his faith.

Of all of the lines in the book I feel that this spoke most to me, and still rings true to this day:

'... if one couldn't communicate the most profound ideas about God and the Bible to children, something was amiss.'"^5^April 27, 2010

BereanDave, ^23296811^5^5^"This supposed historical account has facts omitted the author alone chose to ignore because they came from the Bible. Which is very telling about the book itself. Bill omits what Jesus said from cross which are the most powerful words ever spoken by the Son of God during this time. Bill's sad explanation for this omission based TV interviews is his mistaken belief that the no one heard Jesus say these words. Apparently, the fact that Jesus' words were recorded by Matthew and Mark were not reliable enough for Bill to conclude that these gospel writers spoke the truth. I feel sorry for Bill. what can he possibly trust in the Bible if he picks and chooses what he can trust and what he can't. The true account of Jesus's death is found in the Bible. The Bible, that is the Word of God Himself does not lie. For Bill, I would point him to one just one example to demonstrate just how much he is mistaken about this fact. There were indeed witnesses to what Jesus said on the cross. This example is from Matthew chapter 27:46-47: 'About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eli, Eli,[c] lema sabachthani?' #which means 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'#.
47 WHEN SOME OF THOSE STANDING THERE HEARD THIS said, 'He's calling Elijah.' #NIV#. That is the truth, whether Bill wants to believe it or not. Make no mistake - Bill O'Reilly's claim that any portion of the Bible can't be trusted is an attack on the Bible and an attack on Christianity."^1^May 21, 2014

Nilmar2, ^20529315^8^3^"Having recently read Bill O'Reilly's fabulous 'Killing Lincoln' i really had my hopes up for his book on the Kennedy assassination. It's disappointing. Unfortunately the book misses the mark. Most of the book details the years leading up to the assassination, mostly focusing on JFK and Jackie's relationship against the backdrop of the White House, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile crisis. There is very little on the assassination itself, very little about Oswald, nothing about Ruby and virtually nothing about the crazy quilt of conspiracy theories, conspiracy theorists and weird characters which have so added to the overall feeling of 'something is not right with this picture' when we look back at the assassination. In fairness the title of this book is really misleading it has very little to do with the assassination and presents no new evidence or information.

ZacAbeel, ^3879406^7^0^"Have you ever wondered why some societies in the world are quite developed economically, politically, and militarily, while many more societies in the world have very little wealth, unstable governments, and continually seem on the brink of catastrophe? Guns Germs and Steel is author Jared Diamond's masterpiece in explaining how geographic and environmental conditions are the reasons behind why some countries on this earth 'Have' and why many countries 'Do Not Have.' In only a few hundred pages Diamond changed how I look at and understand the world. If you are someone that wants to know how 'we' as the human race ended up the way we did I strongly recommend this book. If you've ever wondered why things are the way they are, then read this book. In fact, if you've ever wondered about anything, then read this book as an excellent starting point."^5^July 17, 2007
DonSiano, ^3879406^3^0^"Diamond's clearly stated thesis is that geography is the great determiner of human destiny, though, weirdly, it is left out of the title of the book. The book actually has little to say about the three items of the title, but rather focuses on the natural resources available to different regions of the world, the animals that could be domesticated, and the possibilities for communicating with other adjacent cultures. In line with the current passion for multiculturalism, he argues that the people involved are pretty much all equivalent, and that there are no important racial differences that need to be considered. He dismisses the work of the psychometricians whose data, in spite of the taboos of our current state, reveal in hundreds of studies that people's intelligence vary by racial group. He throws out this data, incredibly, based on his own assessments of personal experience with different peoples. In fact, he baldly states his belief that stone age peoples such as New Guineans (whom he knows something about) are actually on average more intelligent than white Europeans. One more example of introspective speculation and personal, anecdotal experience being being mistaken for hard data that can be replicated, graphed, statistically analyzed, and added to by studies with improved methodologies. His attack on such an important question as IQ and the 'wealth of nations' is weak, unconvincing, unscholarly, colored by political correctness, and short. In order to see the importance of geography and race, Diamond might have considered comparing the development over the last few hundred years of the peoples on the islands of Hispaniola and Iceland. Try spending a couple of hours with your browser aimed at the CIA fact book, Google's pictures, and a few other readily available sources, then tell me why you think geography is the prime mover in the fate of nations! His hopes of helping to see history become more scientific, argued in his last chapter, though, certainly is meritorious. Really important questions about the history and destiny of man can and should be attacked by scientific methods, and perhaps Diamond's accretion of observations and speculations do serve as a sort of start, something like how alchemy started chemistry."^1^October 20, 2006
Niecierpek, ^3879406^3^0^"The book is an attempt to answer the question why the rise of complex human societies unfolded differently on different continents. The main conclusion is it was differences in continental environments, not in human biology. Advanced technology, centralized political organization, writing, and other features of complex societies could emerge only in dense sedentary populations capable of accumulating food surpluses. The domesticable wild plants and animal species essential for that rise of agriculture were distributed very unevenly over the continents. The most valuable suitable wild species were concentrated in only nine small areas on Earth, which became in turn the first places suitable for agriculture, which were in turn the first places to develop guns, germs and steel. Descendants of those societies became dominant in the ancient and the modern world. This is, in a very short synopsis, the book. This is the thesis that Diamond poses at the beginning of the book and then takes 400 pages to prove- in my opinion very successfully. It makes for a compelling, superbly organized read and a fantastic anti-racist thesis."^5^December 9, 2006

primalprayer, ^3879406^2^0^"I know a lot of people who have started this book, liked it, but never finished it. I have finished it and have been fully rewarded through the insight it gave me about how our world has developed. The book is written to answer a question posed by a man from New Guinea to the author about the reason white men have so many things and black men so few. The answer is contained in this book and the reasons have nothing to do with 'the superiority of a race' as some are led to believe."^5^October 29, 2006
ejp1082, ^3879406^2^0^"Jared Diamond takes a broad view of human history and argues that geography was the primary thing driving the evolution of societies, making the eventual dominance of eurasian societies all but inevitable. He defends his thesis with an array of evidence from astonishingly disparate fields - genetics, evolutionary biology, archeology, climatology, linguistics, and dozens of others play a role here. Altogether, the author presents a fascinating case laid out in an easily understood way, that's a must-read for anyone with an interest in human history."^5^November 21, 2005
marysargent, ^3879406^2^0^"This was consistently interesting, and quite well written for the intelligent lay reader. It is flawed by Diamond's obvious bias toward proving that the fates of human societies 'don't involve human racial differences at all'. He says he objects to such racist explanations not ONLY because they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Shouldn't truth come first? Surely they would not be loathsome if they were true? However, he was thorough enough that I was absolutely convinced of his arguments. And happy to be so."^5^April 8, 2008
DSD, ^3879406^1^0^"This book was a definite eye opener on a variety of subjects. For me, parts two (The Rise and Spread of Food) and three (From Food to Guns) where the most interesting. I was amazed to learn how natural selection already started with food domestication and how the first farmers were already practicing a primitive form of genetic engineering. It was also astonishing to learn that the first full blown (although unintentional) form of biological warfare was waged against the Native Americans by the early American settlers. By the time the settlers reached mid America, there were almost no Native American's left to be displaced because they had been wiped out by the likes of influenza and small pox. Learning that most human diseases originated in animals also shed new light on the bird flu epidemics of recent times. It's also worth considering that if the Chinese hadn't given up on building sea worthy ships, America might have a very different racial mix right now (this was also covered in Kim Stanley Robinsons alternate history book called 'The Years of Rice and Salt'). The begining of the book is a bit tough to get into but once you do it becomes easier except towards the end where the author tries to apply 'what you've learned' to why the world is the way it is which doesn't have the same pace as previous chapters. All in all an educational and interesting read."^4^October 31, 2006

OldRoses, ^3879406^1^0^"Whenever I read a book that I really like, I always check out the bibliography to see if there are other books on the subject that I might like to read. I pay special attention to books that are specifically mentioned in the text of whatever book I am reading. Lately, one title has come up over and over, 'Guns, Germs, and Steel'. I read it when it was published in 1997. Because so many authors are using it in their research, I decided that it was time to read it again. Rereading this book was a pleasure. Enough time has passed since my first reading, that I experienced those 'aha' moments again. Moments when what the author is saying is so clear and makes so much sense that I find myself wondering why I have never looked at the subject in that light before. His thesis is very simple. The reason that Eurasian peoples conquered and colonized the world was not because they were smarter than the so-called primitive societies that they encountered. Instead, the reason was simply that they had more plants and animals in their environment that were suitable for domestication which led to population increases which led to more people to come up with technological inventions such as the writing and sophisticated weapons. Peoples lacking enough plants and animals in their environment that were suitable for domestication either got a later start at food production and technology or never moved beyond the hunter-gatherer stage. Which is not to say that they were any less intelligent. My favorite anecdote is about two English explorers who perished while attempting to traverse the outback of Australia, an area where the aboriginal tribes had been able to find enough food and water to survive with no problem for thousands of years. And while it is true that many conquered peoples died from the diseases that were introduced by Europeans, those same Europeans died of tropical diseases at the same rates until 20th century medicine was able to overcome them. It's no surprise that this book has become a classic. Nor should it surprise anyone that it is the Ur text for anyone writing on climate, food and human civilization."^5^August 5, 2010

jcbrunner, ^4543330^2^0^"Roger Crowley's pageturner gets good mileage out of presenting the fall of Constantinople as a decisive and open moment. In reality, it was not a 'clash of Islam and the West', as the West chose not to involve itself for the leftover city of the Byzantine Empire. All the surrounding areas had already been gobbled up by the Ottoman Empire. Similar to Monty Python's black knight unwilling to admit defeat, the Byzantine ruling class decided to go down fighting instead of adopting the pragmatic solution of the hard-nosed Genoese who observed the siege in safety across the Golden Horn. Minus the fake clash of civilizations bit (much cherished by conservatives everywhere), Crowley's account is a quick and enjoyable read."^4^January 31, 2015
Stbalbach, ^4543330^1^0^"This is my third Crowley book and least favorite, even though it's his most popular (by LibraryThing ownership stats) and his first book. Still, it is informative and entertaining. Chronologically it falls somewhere between City of Fortune and Empires of the Sea, it would be good to read them in order as it gives broader historical context. This book is focused on a single event, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, which is truly seismic as it kicked off centuries of conflict between Europe and the Ottoman Turks; and shifted European attention away from the east and outward into the Atlantic. Stories about Medieval sieges are like dramatic genre novels, if you read enough of them they often follow similar scripts and events. This is the mother of sieges in sheer scale - of the walls, numbers of combatants, the size of the weapons, the stakes (real and figurative). I'm glad to have read about it in more detail as it's one of those things you can't avoid, it is one of the core markers of the end of the Middle Ages and start of the Early Modern period."^4^October 27, 2016

JDHomrighausen, ^605093068^2^0^"This was an Audible impulse buy, but I'm glad I got it. DuBois, an African-American university professor in the early 1900s, wrote this book as a response to Booker T. Washington's plan for the post-slavery black community, and as a documentation of the kind of demoralization, fragmentation, and hopelessness of black America post-Civil War. Washington's approach was pragmatic. African-Americans should stop lobbying for political rights. (Perhaps he felt it would incite too much backlash?) They should not dream of going to college, but of attending technical schools and going into the trades. Black America will succeed by putting their heads down and working hard for economic prosperity, with healthy doses of thrift and sacrifice. DuBois' response was that a culture needs more than bread to live on. African-Americans needed to gain the ability to think about the world they live in, to articulate their experience and what they have to offer to our country. This could only come about through liberal education, not trade school alone. DuBois points out that the teachers at Washington's trade schools were not trained at trade schools, but at black colleges. These colleges also produced needed moral, spiritual, and intellectual leaders of the black community: professors, preachers, doctors, and other professionals. Besides, Du Bois points out, Washington's ethic of 'buckle down, work hard' doesn't even work. Du Bois documents the very real economic plight of the supposedly freed men and women. Though they are legally free, they are trapped in a cycle of indebted tenant farming. The few who, through ingenuity and the luck of a few good harvests, save up the money to buy their own land, are often cheated by whites who take their money and run. This and other structural inequalities, such as poor education funding and unstable families due to the heritage of slavery, expose Washington's philosophy for the canard it is - so says Du Bois. This book has made me curious to read Washington and hear his side of the story. Formerly, said Du Bois, the 'best' blacks (the house slaves) and the 'best' whites were intimate, living together and having bonds of quasi-family ties; now they are segregated. How then can we understand one another? What's so sad is that most of this book can still apply today. In some ways, not much has changed for African-Americans living with the legacy of slavery and subsequent political and economic disenfranchisement. As a historical work, Du Bois' book is important to read 113 years later; his bristling literary style, full of high-brow literary allusions, only adds pleasure."^5^August 6, 2013
missbrandysue, ^605093068^1^0^"W.E.B. Du Bois narrates his journeys of the South after the Emancipation of slavery. It tells of the systemic racism that was institutionalized during this time. My professor at the University of Texas at Austin told me to read this after discussion of Booker T Washington's book, Up From Slavery. He said this gave a more accurate picture of the time. It was very eye-opening for me since I never studied this literature in my high school or college courses. As an education historian I used this book to make many connections about how African Americans were unfairly treated during the Reconstruction Era and beyond leading to current achievement gaps. It was a very dense book and took a lot of time to get through the content. My copy is full of highlighting, notes, and underlined pieces. I'm a better person for having read it!"^4^July 26, 2016
melodyaw, ^605093068^1^0^"It is impossible to rate The Souls of Black Folk too highly. It is a worthwhile read solely for the impact that it has had upon American society, both in its time and in the decades since its 1903 publication. The Souls of Black Folk was a major contribution to the African-American literary tradition, and it is also a cornerstone of the literature on sociology. Beyond its historical and educational value, though, I highly recommend this book to everyone for the piercing glimpses Du Bois offers into the souls of all men and women. W. E. B. Du Bois first came under the spotlight by opposing Booker T. Washington, a prominent member of the African-American community who emphasized the importance of accommodating the policies of race separation prevalent in a Jim Crow society. Du Bois believed that in order to attain suffrage, political representation, and civil rights, American society had to acknowledge the wrongs done to African-Americans and strive to integrate them fully into U.S. society. His book documented the conditions of post-slavery America while simultaneously arguing for improvements in the unequal black and white communities. Du Bois was an impassioned advocate for higher education. While Washington focused on educating blacks for the trades and manual labor, Du Bois insisted that blacks should have access to intellectual education rivaling that available to whites. As Manning Marable states in Living Black History, 'Few books make history, and fewer still become foundational texts for the movements and struggles of an entire people. The Souls of Black Folk occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century.' (96) However, more than simply a revealing microcosm of post-Civil War and Jim Crow society, The Souls of Black Folk offer brilliant glimpses into mankind as a whole, regardless of color. Du Bois discusses religion, politics, history, education, money, morality, music, and mortality. His chapter on death of his young son, his first child, is some of the most impressive, tender, and passionate prose I have ever read. It is easy-at least, it was for me-to pigeonhole Du Bois as a figure who did much for his race in the Jim Crow era, but whose work is outdated and useful only as a historical account. However, this view does Du Bois, and yourself for that matter, a disservice. I found his insight profound and his opinions valuable even after more than a century, and I learned a lot about the nature of people. The salience of The Souls of Black Folk attests to Du Bois's insistence on the importance of an intellectual tradition, both among black thinkers and, on a grander scale, in the then-emerging field of sociology. Though at times the book seems to be a rather disparate collection of essays loosely centered on African-American (and cultural) identity, that connection serves, in fact,. to emphasize that topic's importance by displaying the ways in which racism was affecting all areas of African-American life. I have one piece of advice for enjoying this book: I listened to it on audiobook, and I've discovered that I tend to pay better attention to stories than intellectual discourse in audiobook format. If you're anything like me, you may want to read a paperback or e-book. You'll want to highlight dozens of passages anyway!"^4^September 27, 2010

^44978133^3^0^"This book was absolutely amazing and unforgettable. It's like 3 memoirs in one. What a powerful story. It is so well written, I could not put the book down.

I am just so inspired after reading about these 3 boys courageous journey to survive. They went through a heartbreaking experience and still came out victorious. It shows the triumph of the human spirit and that if you have the will to make it, you can make it no matter what your age.

I've read other books on similar subjects but I found this one to be the most easy to read with short chapters (for those with short attention spans) and very reader-friendly. That makes it suitable for all ages from kids in Jr. high like my students (I am an 8th grade teacher), most of whom also could not put the book down, to an adult looking for the next fascinating read.

I am glad I came across this life changing book and recommend it for everyone. It is entertaining, suspenseful and educational all in one."^5^July 13, 2015

I made one little sound on it and he grabbed it out of my hands and took off and played it for an hour the first night non-stop. It was not a bad noise at all... actually fun and funny and quite nice... nothing at all like loud toys. I just love seeing how much fun he has with it. He took it to his Pre-K class the other day for toy day and they said he played it for almost an hour till all the other children were having fits wanting to play it but they all loved it.

JDHomrighausen, ^605093068^2^0^"This was an Audible impulse buy, but I'm glad I got it. DuBois, an African-American university professor in the early 1900s, wrote this book as a response to Booker T. Washington's plan for the post-slavery black community, and as a documentation of the kind of demoralization, fragmentation, and hopelessness of black America post-Civil War. Washington's approach was pragmatic. African-Americans should stop lobbying for political rights. (Perhaps he felt it would incite too much backlash?) They should not dream of going to college, but of attending technical schools and going into the trades. Black America will succeed by putting their heads down and working hard for economic prosperity, with healthy doses of thrift and sacrifice. DuBois' response was that a culture needs more than bread to live on. African-Americans needed to gain the ability to think about the world they live in, to articulate their experience and what they have to offer to our country. This could only come about through liberal education, not trade school alone. DuBois points out that the teachers at Washington's trade schools were not trained at trade schools, but at black colleges. These colleges also produced needed moral, spiritual, and intellectual leaders of the black community: professors, preachers, doctors, and other professionals. Besides, Du Bois points out, Washington's ethic of 'buckle down, work hard' doesn't even work. Du Bois documents the very real economic plight of the supposedly freed men and women. Though they are legally free, they are trapped in a cycle of indebted tenant farming. The few who, through ingenuity and the luck of a few good harvests, save up the money to buy their own land, are often cheated by whites who take their money and run. This and other structural inequalities, such as poor education funding and unstable families due to the heritage of slavery, expose Washington's philosophy for the canard it is - so says Du Bois. This book has made me curious to read Washington and hear his side of the story. Formerly, said Du Bois, the 'best' blacks (the house slaves) and the 'best' whites were intimate, living together and having bonds of quasi-family ties; now they are segregated. How then can we understand one another? What's so sad is that most of this book can still apply today. In some ways, not much has changed for African-Americans living with the legacy of slavery and subsequent political and economic disenfranchisement. As a historical work, Du Bois' book is important to read 113 years later; his bristling literary style, full of high-brow literary allusions, only adds pleasure."^5^August 6, 2013
missbrandysue, ^605093068^1^0^"W.E.B. Du Bois narrates his journeys of the South after the Emancipation of slavery. It tells of the systemic racism that was institutionalized during this time. My professor at the University of Texas at Austin told me to read this after discussion of Booker T Washington's book, Up From Slavery. He said this gave a more accurate picture of the time. It was very eye-opening for me since I never studied this literature in my high school or college courses. As an education historian I used this book to make many connections about how African Americans were unfairly treated during the Reconstruction Era and beyond leading to current achievement gaps. It was a very dense book and took a lot of time to get through the content. My copy is full of highlighting, notes, and underlined pieces. I'm a better person for having read it!"^4^July 26, 2016
melodyaw, ^605093068^1^0^"It is impossible to rate The Souls of Black Folk too highly. It is a worthwhile read solely for the impact that it has had upon American society, both in its time and in the decades since its 1903 publication. The Souls of Black Folk was a major contribution to the African-American literary tradition, and it is also a cornerstone of the literature on sociology. Beyond its historical and educational value, though, I highly recommend this book to everyone for the piercing glimpses Du Bois offers into the souls of all men and women. W. E. B. Du Bois first came under the spotlight by opposing Booker T. Washington, a prominent member of the African-American community who emphasized the importance of accommodating the policies of race separation prevalent in a Jim Crow society. Du Bois believed that in order to attain suffrage, political representation, and civil rights, American society had to acknowledge the wrongs done to African-Americans and strive to integrate them fully into U.S. society. His book documented the conditions of post-slavery America while simultaneously arguing for improvements in the unequal black and white communities. Du Bois was an impassioned advocate for higher education. While Washington focused on educating blacks for the trades and manual labor, Du Bois insisted that blacks should have access to intellectual education rivaling that available to whites. As Manning Marable states in Living Black History, 'Few books make history, and fewer still become foundational texts for the movements and struggles of an entire people. The Souls of Black Folk occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century.' (96) However, more than simply a revealing microcosm of post-Civil War and Jim Crow society, The Souls of Black Folk offer brilliant glimpses into mankind as a whole, regardless of color. Du Bois discusses religion, politics, history, education, money, morality, music, and mortality. His chapter on death of his young son, his first child, is some of the most impressive, tender, and passionate prose I have ever read. It is easy-at least, it was for me-to pigeonhole Du Bois as a figure who did much for his race in the Jim Crow era, but whose work is outdated and useful only as a historical account. However, this view does Du Bois, and yourself for that matter, a disservice. I found his insight profound and his opinions valuable even after more than a century, and I learned a lot about the nature of people. The salience of The Souls of Black Folk attests to Du Bois's insistence on the importance of an intellectual tradition, both among black thinkers and, on a grander scale, in the then-emerging field of sociology. Though at times the book seems to be a rather disparate collection of essays loosely centered on African-American (and cultural) identity, that connection serves, in fact,. to emphasize that topic's importance by displaying the ways in which racism was affecting all areas of African-American life. I have one piece of advice for enjoying this book: I listened to it on audiobook, and I've discovered that I tend to pay better attention to stories than intellectual discourse in audiobook format. If you're anything like me, you may want to read a paperback or e-book. You'll want to highlight dozens of passages anyway!"^4^September 27, 2010
