beatlefan, ^20467296^4^1^"I bought this book to see how it matched up to the movie. It doesn't but that's okay. What is really odd is that there are spelling and grammar errors in this book. I was only about a quarter of the way into the book and have found at least five errors. Other than that, not a bad book."^3^April 9, 2014

luv2dancealii, ^10957986^2^0^"This book is so ah-mazing. It has romance, comedy, seperations, silence, and more! When I first started reading it, it made me want to stay in bed all day just to read it. I love this book. Soon after I realize that the little girl may never talk, I began to wonder if this book was actually good for anything besides heartbreak. And then I realized, that they wouldn't make a book if the characters didn't talk. And I got all the way through the book, and it was ah-mazing! So no matter what may happen you have to keep reading this book! Do not put it down! You will regret it! Trust me!"^5^September 24, 2009

andi127, ^15403888^1^0^"I don't know what I could say about The Stand that hasn't already been said. I have loved this book since about 1978 when I read it the first time and went on to read it twice more. I just bought the paperback for my 15 year old granddaughter, hoping she will love it just as much. In my opinion, SK never again wrote anything as perfect. I wish they could find a way to being it to the screen and do it justice, the Rob Lowe movie wasn't it. I think it should be an HBO series. That would be something to see!"^5^December 21, 2013

acaptaind, ^11052066^5^0^"Let me start by saying that I was never into reading books. After that said, I can now say I am do to Lee Child's. Now to the book, I started donating and I was so bored just sitting there. I decided that I will get a book and ended up picking this one. With in the first chapter I was already hooked. This book, along with the whole Reacher Novels by Lee Child, has mystery, suspence, romance, comedy, thrills and anything else you can think of. Even the ending of this book was just wonderful. I can only say that if you are looking for a great book or want to get into reading, this is really a great book."^5^August 22, 2010

valueSue, ^1631558^2^0^"I've read thousands of books, maybe 10's of thousands, and this is one of the best. When I finished it I took a breath and knew I'd just read something special. A well written action/mystery/ with a special comaraderie among women where the main characters were well developed. The book flowed and alternated between story lines with the usual hard-to-put-down quality of James Patterson's writing style. This begins a long series of enjoyable books. A great read."^5^August 2, 2014

Thor, ^15441704^1^1^"John Grisham has turned away from his talent and turned into a political hack. 'The Confession' reeks with liberal slant and innuendos. He makes it clear he hates conservatives, the death penalty, and any form of Christianity that has any semblance of accountability. Conservatives are made to look like hate mongering, racist, ignoramuses. I used to love John Grisham books and have read most of his novels. However, I will not be purchasing any more of his books. His attacks on conservatives, and especially conservative Christians, are of the classical, stereotypical nature from the less informed."^1^May 13, 2012

readingKate3, ^15441704^1^0^"I have to admit that when I got this book through bzzagent I was not sure what to expect. I've been a fan of John Grisham's for years but not of the last couple books. So I was happily surprised to find myself unable to put the book down.

I wanted to know what happened next. Would their quest to stop the execution of an innocent man be successful? What would happen next? It was a definite thrill ride of a read and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I would recommend 'The Confession' to anyone."^4^September 2, 2011
michelle31071, ^15441704^1^0^"The Confession: By John Grisham (Received from BzzAgent for Review)

In 1998 Travis Boyette abducts, abuses and murders a high school cheerleader then buries the body so it will never be found. Donte Drumm a local football star is convicted and sentenced to Death Row for the crime while Travis moves on to committ other crimes. Nine years after the murder Travis is released from prison for a different crime and visits a church with Reverend Schroeder preaching. After listening to a sermon given by Reverend Schroeder Travis pays a visit to the Reverend telling the Reverend he has an inoperable brain tumor that is terminal and then tells the Reverend about Donte who is on Death Row for a crime he didn't committ. But Travis leaves from the first visit without actually confessing. The rest of the story tells how the Reverend Schroeder works to get Travis to confess to try to save Donte and the trials of getting a legal system that has already convicted someone of a crime to listen in time to try to save Donte.

REVIEW: As with all John Grisham books that I have read this one is extremely well written and holds a readers attention from page one and is still offering surprises on the last page. Grisham like many good writers uses his writting to give voice to his personal view points on the death penalty and what he sees as flaws in our legal system, causing a reader to think and question the status quo. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dramatic legal suspense stories."^5^September 27, 2011
toto15, ^15182873^6^0^"This was a great book, and it was so thrilling that I had trouble laying it down. I received this book on Sat. and finished it on Sun.

Great James Patterson book."^5^September 5, 2011
bnewcomer, ^140909480^1^0^"Well-written and captivating for a spell, but as the investigation falls apart, so does the book. Towards the end, it was a little excruciating. Many of the characters feel realistic in some spots, and endearing (or not), but then act in completely unexpected ways, and for longer than is reasonable, or comfortable, or believable -- acting against reason in the manner of characters in a bad horror film, but in the wrong context. Still, the atmosphere is often compelling, and the writing is enjoyable for the first 1/3 or maybe 2/3rds."^3^April 2, 2013

MrJiggyFly, ^11025257^5^0^"Dean Koontz did a great job on all three Frankenstein novels. His books prompted me to buy the original text by Mary Shelley.

I was pleased to see Koontz kept most of the monsters qualities from Mary Shelley's descriptions. Victor Frankenstein (Helios) was very different from the original book but Koontz does a good job making Helios a bad, bad man.

Grab all three of these books and get to readin'!"^5^February 11, 2010
Lucy, ^54706404^1^0^"Heart pounding.....amazing.....creative second book in The If I Run series. Terri Blackstock has a way of drawing you in and keeping you on the edge of your seat till the end. I love the characters and how relatable they are. These books touch on some subjects that some would find off limits, such as corruption in the police force and abuse of a child, but it is handled in a very realistic way and has your heart breaking. The only drawback is having to wait till March 2018 for the final installment. I absolutely can not wait, as this is a book that sticks in your head and you feel like you are a part of the story because the characters are that real. Well worth reading, especially if you love suspense with a Faith element. 
I received a complimentary copy from Thomas Nelson and Zondervan Fiction Guild. The honest review and opinions are my own and were not required."^5^May 1, 2017
Jaquelyn2, ^54706404^1^0^"This series has me hooked.  I knew without a doubt that this book was going to be impossible to put down, and Blackstock didn’t disappoint.  After reading the first book in the series titled If I Run I was literally dying for this book to come out.  And surprise, surprise I am now dying for the next book.  That being said, I believe that you will enjoy this book even if you haven’t read the first one.  In the first book we meet Casey as she starts running for her life, and Dylan while he tries to find her.  If I’m Found starts off with Casey still running, and hoping no one is able to find her.

Casey knows she must do everything in her power to never get caught.  Running forever doesn’t sound fun, but when you consider being dead as the alternative she knows it’s a must.  Hoping to collect evidence against the real killers while in hiding isn’t an easy task.  Not only is it dangerous but it can also be a pretty lonely existence.  When Casey notices injustices she has a hard time not helping those in need.  Even if doing so puts her in even more danger it that’s possible.  Dylan reaching out to her gives her hope, but she also knows not to trust too easily.  Is Dylan really on her side?  Can she find enough evidence to put the true criminals behind bars?

I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Mystery and Suspense.  I really enjoyed reading first person, and found it refreshing to see that point of view.  I was kept on the edge of my seat and couldn’t wait to see what would happen next.  I received a copy of this book from Zondervan in exchange for my honest opinion.  All opinions expressed are my own."^5^March 28, 2017

Get it - really a good book but consider starting at the beginning of the series, is my recommendation."^5^October 26, 2012
DebC, ^5706100^3^2^"is an oddball, a man with so much talent and heart, but who just takes it to highways and byways and always rescues the damsel in distress, or solves the mystery, and gets the bad guys and gals. This one was heartbreaking for me, but for Reacher, it was what he needed to survive.
Who he is and what he does is more entertainment than one person should get from a fictional character, but that is what it is all about, yes? Lee Child writes a page turner that keeps me up all night, until I get to the outcome. And then I want to start the next adventure right away. Lee Child does not fail to deliver Jack Reacher, and I am in love with the author's work and the fictional character he has created in Jack Reacher.
I could go on but you get the idea."^5^February 16, 2011

Jellokel, ^21917640^1^1^"This book was well written even though I did find a few errors with it BUT...anyone who reads King knows he takes a while to unwind the story. This book is less than 300 pages in which it takes about 220 of them to finally get somewhere. This book is more about a kid at a summer job (very boring) than anything else and the main character is beyond his years with smarts for his age. Also, both women on the 2 various covers aren't very involved in the storyline so it throws you off thinking the story is more about them. At the end, the mystery and reveal isn't very exciting. It was very predictable which small group of people could have done it. I couldn't wait on this one because of the previous one for Hard Case, 'Colorado Kid' since it really had you thinking and was only about 170 pages while a real mystery & cliffhanger. I would say read this if you are a diehard but otherwise you may be disappointed because the mystery part is just at best very minimally involved."^3^June 14, 2013

debs4jc, ^469917^2^0^"A complex plot that intertwines the past and the present with a treasure hunt of sorts makes this one fun read. It all centers around a chessboard and its pieces--pieces that seem to give those that hold them power, and then when all assembled could give even more. Two women, one in the past, one in the present are chosen as 'queens' to guard--or to find?--this great treasure. But they aren't the only players in the game. This was a lot of fun to listen to, a great adventure tale with many twists and turns. I got amused at the number of historical figures that popped up. It is quite unbelievable, so take it all in fun and enjoy the ride as the story takes you across a chessboard that spans the globe."^4^December 29, 2009
michdubb, ^469917^1^0^"A thoroughly good read about two women whose paths intertwine as they seek to unravel a thousand year old mystery hidden in an ancient chess set. Catherine is a modern-day career woman, computer expert, and artist who is sent to Algeria to work for OPEC. Mirielle is a young nun whose life is turned upside down at the height of the French Revolution. Famous politicians and artists (Napolean, Fournier, Voltaire, Woodsworth) make appearances as players in this real-life chess game. While obviously highly unprobable at times, it is a fun and engaging tale. One element that felt a bit thin was the character of Catherine, who does seem to lack a history or life prior to the start of the novel. She doesn't seem to have any family and this isn't really explained or addressed. There was no 'eureka moment' at the end when her own personal story is revealed. I think this was a lost opportunity and wish the author had been able to weave this last strand into the overarching fabric of the story."^4^July 10, 2011
kd9, ^469917^1^0^"In 1973 Cat Velis is a smart, independent computer consultant with a dysfunctional family in New York City. When she refuses to rig a bid for her boss, she is sent to Algeria to help the nascent OPEC. But there is more mystery in store for her than just oil manipulations. Her uncle, an antiques dealer, has asked her to transport a mysterious piece from a chess set. In 1790, the French Revolution has started and the Catholic nunneries are not refuges that they once were. Montglane Abbey has been the sanctuary of a deadly secret for over a thousand years, but now the secret must be moved and scattered to keep it out of the hands of the ruthless who would use it to gain more power. Mireille de Rémy takes a piece of this powerful chess set to Paris and becomes the focus a power struggle that takes the life of her best friend. How the struggle for these pieces from an alchemical chess set transform the people who carry them, whether pawns or queens, makes for a gripping tale. I enjoyed most of the characters and the plot, but every so often, the author's noveau status shows in some poor word choice or too lengthy explanation. I especially grew tired of the phrase 'but little did she know...' That is a construction that most novice authors manage to avoid. Overall, if you like novels with strong female protagonists and quite a lot of historical background, but don't mind a strong dose of mysticism, you will enjoy this book."^3^October 6, 2008

JessicaCapelle, ^469917^1^0^"A fantastic, complex book. I truly enjoyed how Neville travels back and forth between the eras, unveiling layers of intrigue and adventure. She creates a chess game of a novel that keeps you interested and on your toes. What a fantastic story."^5^August 13, 2009
turtlesleap, ^469917^1^0^"I rarely abandon a book once I've started reading it. This was an exception. I ploughed through about two-thirds of it, then rolled my eyes one last time and quit. In a parallel plot-line tracking action in modern times and in th 1790's, the author postulates the existence of a chess set, once owned by Charlmagne and at the heart of a dizzying array of plots, counterplots, riddles and codes. For the portion of the story taking place in the 18th Century, the author invokes as many historical figures of the era as possible. The effect is just silly. The story was ho-hum and the author's habit of injecting a phrase like 'little did she know that her actions would blah, blah, blah' in order to keep the reader informed of events unfolding was downright irritating. Ham-handed at best."^2^March 9, 2009
melydia, ^469917^1^0^"This is my second time reading this book and it was amazing all over again. Like all of Neville's novels, two stories are interweaved: one in the present (in this case, the 1970's) and one in the past (late 18th century). Two women, a computer expert and nun, attempt each in their respective time periods to unravel the mystery behind a powerful and much-coveted ancient chess set, the Montglane Service. This book is full of action and romance, suspense and memorable characters. The number of famous historical figures who show up does border on the absurd, but I was too busy having a good time to nitpick. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.Side note for those who've read the book: my sister was in love with Solarin, but my heart belongs to Nim. :)"^5^October 28, 2009

AltheaAnn, ^469917^1^0^"I read a review of this book online that led me to believe I might enjoy it. I ordered it - and when I got the book in the mail, I saw that the cover blurb read something like, 'If you loved the Da Vinci Code, you'll love The Eight.''OH NO,' I said. Because I certainly did NOT love the Da Vinci Code (although it is, admittedly, the best of Dan Brown's shoddily researched and crappily written novels.)Nevertheless, I read this book; cover blurbs are not always correct. Unfortunately, in this case, it was absolutely correct. It was very similar to Dan Brown's writing, both in style and content. If you are into unlikely and ridiculous conspiracy theories that don't stand up to a bit of logical thought, and have a lot of time to kill, go for it.(My problem is that I really like novels that involve conspiracies - but I have absolutely no patience for conspiracy theories.)The premise is that Catherine Velis, a computer expert at the top of her field (or so we are told - not ONCE in the VERY LONG book does she do anything, or even THINK in such a way that would indicate she knows anything about computers), is sent to Algeria on assignment. Her antique-dealing friend takes advantage of this to try to get her to acquire some rare chess pieces while she is there.Meanwhile, back in the 18th century, two young novice nuns (yes, this is an excuse for some unnecessary but oddly understated trashiness) are asked by their abbess to participate in hiding the Very Same chess pieces, which everyone is out to get - because they are imbued with Magical Powers which will allow the owner of the whole chess set to Take Over the World.Poorly written. Characters that seem to have their attributes assigned to them by dice roll. Historically inaccurate. Unnecessarily long. Trashy, but not trashy enough to be titillating. Unconvincing fantasy elements. Plot elements that don't stand up to any sort of analysis. Boring."^1^February 9, 2016

I couldn't wait on this one because of the previous one for Hard Case, 'Colorado Kid' since it really had you thinking and was only about 170 pages while a real mystery & cliffhanger. I would say read this if you are a diehard but otherwise you may be disappointed because the mystery part is just at best very minimally involved."^3^June 14, 2013

debs4jc, ^469917^2^0^"A complex plot that intertwines the past and the present with a treasure hunt of sorts makes this one fun read. It all centers around a chessboard and its pieces--pieces that seem to give those that hold them power, and then when all assembled could give even more. Two women, one in the past, one in the present are chosen as 'queens' to guard--or to find?--this great treasure. But they aren't the only players in the game. This was a lot of fun to listen to, a great adventure tale with many twists and turns. I got amused at the number of historical figures that popped up. It is quite unbelievable, so take it all in fun and enjoy the ride as the story takes you across a chessboard that spans the globe."^4^December 29, 2009
michdubb, ^469917^1^0^"A thoroughly good read about two women whose paths intertwine as they seek to unravel a thousand year old mystery hidden in an ancient chess set. Catherine is a modern-day career woman, computer expert, and artist who is sent to Algeria to work for OPEC. Mirielle is a young nun whose life is turned upside down at the height of the French Revolution. Famous politicians and artists (Napolean, Fournier, Voltaire, Woodsworth) make appearances as players in this real-life chess game. While obviously highly unprobable at times, it is a fun and engaging tale. One element that felt a bit thin was the character of Catherine, who does seem to lack a history or life prior to the start of the novel. She doesn't seem to have any family and this isn't really explained or addressed. There was no 'eureka moment' at the end when her own personal story is revealed. I think this was a lost opportunity and wish the author had been able to weave this last strand into the overarching fabric of the story."^4^July 10, 2011
kd9, ^469917^1^0^"In 1973 Cat Velis is a smart, independent computer consultant with a dysfunctional family in New York City. When she refuses to rig a bid for her boss, she is sent to Algeria to help the nascent OPEC. But there is more mystery in store for her than just oil manipulations. Her uncle, an antiques dealer, has asked her to transport a mysterious piece from a chess set. In 1790, the French Revolution has started and the Catholic nunneries are not refuges that they once were. Montglane Abbey has been the sanctuary of a deadly secret for over a thousand years, but now the secret must be moved and scattered to keep it out of the hands of the ruthless who would use it to gain more power. Mireille de Rémy takes a piece of this powerful chess set to Paris and becomes the focus a power struggle that takes the life of her best friend. How the struggle for these pieces from an alchemical chess set transform the people who carry them, whether pawns or queens, makes for a gripping tale. I enjoyed most of the characters and the plot, but every so often, the author's noveau status shows in some poor word choice or too lengthy explanation. I especially grew tired of the phrase 'but little did she know...' That is a construction that most novice authors manage to avoid. Overall, if you like novels with strong female protagonists and quite a lot of historical background, but don't mind a strong dose of mysticism, you will enjoy this book."^3^October 6, 2008

turtlesleap, ^469917^1^0^"I rarely abandon a book once I've started reading it. This was an exception. I ploughed through about two-thirds of it, then rolled my eyes one last time and quit. In a parallel plot-line tracking action in modern times and in th 1790's, the author postulates the existence of a chess set, once owned by Charlmagne and at the heart of a dizzying array of plots, counterplots, riddles and codes. For the portion of the story taking place in the 18th Century, the author invokes as many historical figures of the era as possible. The effect is just silly. The story was ho-hum and the author's habit of injecting a phrase like 'little did she know that her actions would blah, blah, blah' in order to keep the reader informed of events unfolding was downright irritating. Ham-handed at best."^2^March 9, 2009
melydia, ^469917^1^0^"This is my second time reading this book and it was amazing all over again. Like all of Neville's novels, two stories are interweaved: one in the present (in this case, the 1970's) and one in the past (late 18th century). Two women, a computer expert and nun, attempt each in their respective time periods to unravel the mystery behind a powerful and much-coveted ancient chess set, the Montglane Service. This book is full of action and romance, suspense and memorable characters. The number of famous historical figures who show up does border on the absurd, but I was too busy having a good time to nitpick. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.Side note for those who've read the book: my sister was in love with Solarin, but my heart belongs to Nim. :)"^5^October 28, 2009

AltheaAnn, ^469917^1^0^"I read a review of this book online that led me to believe I might enjoy it. I ordered it - and when I got the book in the mail, I saw that the cover blurb read something like, 'If you loved the Da Vinci Code, you'll love The Eight.''OH NO,' I said. Because I certainly did NOT love the Da Vinci Code (although it is, admittedly, the best of Dan Brown's shoddily researched and crappily written novels.)Nevertheless, I read this book; cover blurbs are not always correct. Unfortunately, in this case, it was absolutely correct. It was very similar to Dan Brown's writing, both in style and content. If you are into unlikely and ridiculous conspiracy theories that don't stand up to a bit of logical thought, and have a lot of time to kill, go for it.(My problem is that I really like novels that involve conspiracies - but I have absolutely no patience for conspiracy theories.)The premise is that Catherine Velis, a computer expert at the top of her field (or so we are told - not ONCE in the VERY LONG book does she do anything, or even THINK in such a way that would indicate she knows anything about computers), is sent to Algeria on assignment. Her antique-dealing friend takes advantage of this to try to get her to acquire some rare chess pieces while she is there.Meanwhile, back in the 18th century, two young novice nuns (yes, this is an excuse for some unnecessary but oddly understated trashiness) are asked by their abbess to participate in hiding the Very Same chess pieces, which everyone is out to get - because they are imbued with Magical Powers which will allow the owner of the whole chess set to Take Over the World.Poorly written. Characters that seem to have their attributes assigned to them by dice roll. Historically inaccurate. Unnecessarily long. Trashy, but not trashy enough to be titillating. Unconvincing fantasy elements. Plot elements that don't stand up to any sort of analysis. Boring."^1^February 9, 2016

DeltaQueen50, ^16827100^10^0^"The words of a dying man 'Why Didn't They Ask Evans?' leads Bobby Jones and Lady Frankie Derwent to conclude a murder has occurred and sets them off on a race to solve the mystery. Why Didn't They Ask Evans by Agatha Christie is a fast-paced, exciting story with a few twists and turns along the way to keep the reader engrossed. The more of Agatha Christie I read, the more in awe of her I am. This book is quite different from both her crafty Hercule Poirot and her gentle Miss Marple stories. More of an adventure romp with extremely likeable characters. Even the villain of the piece is charming and rather likeable as he plots his dastardly deeds. The adventure comes full circle when Bobby and Frankie discover who Evans really is. A story of murder, drug dealing, and forgery told only as Agatha Christie can. And of course, those two crazy kids, are they ever going to realize that they are meant for each other? At first glance this book could appear as rather a mess, but I think Miss Christie had her tongue firmly in cheek with the idea of giving her fans something different. Why Didn't They Ask Evans is a top notch mystery and will definitely be on my list of favorite Agatha Christie books."^5^May 21, 2015
atimco, ^16827100^4^0^"Why Didn't They Ask Evans? is vintage 1934 Christie, and so much fun. I recalled the story vaguely from my early days of reading Agatha Christie. I'd binge on four or five of her novels over a weekend and emerge rather confusedly, with various machinations and motives all mixed up in my head. That reading habit didn't make for great plot retention, but despite the fuzziness I remembered this title as being a particularly good one. I listened to the audiobook version read by Emilia Fox and thoroughly enjoyed it. 'Why didn't they ask Evans?' These are the last words of a dying man, who fell from a cliff near Bobby Jones's home. Bobby, a young ex-Naval officer, attaches no importance to the words until an attempt is made on his own life. By that time, Lady Frances Derwent-or, as we shall call her, Frankie-has decided that the man called Alex Pritchard didn't fall from the cliff. He was pushed. But why? And who is the mysterious Evans? Yes, there are several farfetched plot devices (multiple impersonations, the hero's astonishing recovery after being poisoned, the deus ex machina also known as Badger Beadon, etc.). But the ride is so much fun, you just don't care. Frankie and Bobby are utterly appealing protagonists whose relationships and characters are drawn sparingly and believably. And the dialogue is splendidly amusing. I suspect Emilia Fox's reading gave it an extra edge. Fox's narration is excellent, though I did have to get used to the slightly gravelly quality of her voice. She does wonderful character voices and I especially enjoyed the way she portrays Frankie. Christie is generally one of my favorite mystery authors, having introduced me to the genre, and I'm finding her stories are even more enjoyable on audiobook. Good stuff."^4^August 14, 2012

Carlssss, ^20467295^2^5^"The Lost World with four-hundred and thirty pages is a surprisingly entertaining novel. However, it bothered me when the sequel did not line up with the famous Jurassic Park novel and film. For example, It did annoy me a bit that Malcolm was in the novel since he was supposed to have died in the last one. The book did not hold up to my high expectations being that it was indeed the sequel. However, it was a decent book nevertheless. If you are one whom enjoys fictional stories involving prehistoric mysteries, then this is the book for you. Even though this book was written following the success of 'Jurassic Park' the movie, it's still does a fabulous job of being different and plenty scary. The action is very suspenseful and keeps you at the edge of your seat at all times. I would not recommend this book to someone who does not enjoy suspense or a little bit of fear. The tempo is faster and the shocks are all there. Crichton was able to match the intensity and thrills of the first novel. However, This second book didn't quite fill the shoes of the first. It was good, but the first novel is hard to beat. The similarities in character and plot do not necessarily imply a lack of creativity. It just makes for another great book. In summary I would not recommend this book to those who are looking for a sequel to Jurassic Park because the two novels have very different plots and characters."^4^May 29, 2013

Chatterbox, ^499845922^18^0^"'I'm a big fan of the lie of ommission.' By the time Nick Dunne provides us, his avid readers, with this insight into his character, we've already figured it out, thanks to Gillian Flynn's masterful ability to drop one twist after another into this chilling tale, in such as a way to cause a kind of literary double take of such magnitude that if it were a physical response, I'd by now be hospitalized with whiplash. This is certainly the best thriller I'll read this year, and possibly this decade -- and I don't say that lightly. Flynn took me on a hair-raising journey, the equivalent of speeding along a slick, twisting highway at night, with not even a railing separating the car from a plunge down a cliff and into the ocean -- and I simply couldn't put the novel down. Every time I thought I had figured out where she was taking me -- and at what point this novel would relapse into classic 'thriller mode', with a relatively predictable denouement -- she proved me wrong. Better yet, she made each twist completely convincing. The novel itself is the saga of an unraveling marriage that climaxes in the disappearance of Amy Elliott Dunne, Nick's wife, on their fifth wedding anniversary. It's an ironic nod of sorts to so many true-life tragedies (there's even a vitriolic Nancy Grace-style television commentator!), but also a deep dive into a kind of toxic relationship that had me thinking three or four times about every individual I've come into contact with. Amy is the photo-perfect victim: blond, beautiful, the model for her parents' best-selling series of children's books featuring 'Amazing Amy'. But just how amazing is Amy? Well, fairly -- if perhaps not in the sense that we are used to viewing our 'victims'. The slow and gradual revelation of the layers of this story is tantalizing; the nature of what is revealed is chilling. And the real climax of the book is quite possibly the best I've read in any thriller -- Flynn shuns any thought of the 'easy out' when looking for a conclusion, and the final pages left me gasping in astonishment at her imagination and the effortless way she holds all the strands of this narrative together -- and at the plot itself. If this isn't turned into a blockbuster movie, Hollywood execs should be lined up against a wall and shot. On holiday and it's raining, or too hot to go outside? Grab this, and you'll forget about your sunburn, your heatstroke, the mosquito bites and pretty much anything else. On the other hand, it will make you re-evaluate everything your spouse says and does for days and quite possibly weeks... It's not literature, but it's the epitome of a 'thumping good read', and you should stop reading this review now and just go get it -- bookstore, library or just purloin your friend's copy before he/she has finished. 4.5 stars, rounded up. Full disclosure: I got an advance reading copy of this book via NetGalley."^5^July 8, 2012

brokenangelkisses, ^499845922^2^0^"My teetering TBR pile and haphazard reading choices mean I always seem to reach the 'must-read-book-of-the-year' just after everyone else has finished reading and talking about it. Gillian Flynn's third novel, 'Gone Girl', is a case in point: hyped as THE thriller of 2013, I found myself reading it as we slipped into 2014. So was it worth the hype? On Nick Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary, his beautiful wife, Amy, disappears, leaving a trail of evidence that increasingly incriminates Nick. As the police net inexorably tightens, Nick insists that he hasn't harmed Amy and that evidence showing she was scared of him is incorrect. So what has happened to Nick's wife? The first part is enthralling. The narration opens with Nick, who reflects on the shape of Amy's skull and the coils of her mind, and seems to view breakfast with his wife as some kind of torture. Clearly, they are not a straightforwardly happy couple. Nick's voice is engaging and honest - making it more shocking when he reveals that he is hiding information from the police. Flynn ratchets up the tension by keeping the pace of the investigation brisk. Can Nick explain the cleaned-up blood on the kitchen floor? No. Can he explain the lady's underwear in his office? No. Meanwhile Nick is solving clues from Amy's yearly anniversary 'treat': a treasure hunt that requires Nick to demonstrate his detailed knowledge of Amy and their last year together, in order to prove his love. Flynn cleverly builds up a sifting picture of their lives together as Nick reflects on events, recent and earlier on, that allow him to solve the clues. Meanwhile, the narration switches between Nick's attempts to solve Amy's disappearance and brief extracts from Amy's diary, covering the period of their courtship and marriage. This is a neat device that reveals the couple's completely divergent views of their marriage and keeps suspense building. Then came the twist. Shocking, though not entirely unpredictable. Dramatic, requiring some adjusting of prior ideas. But plausible. And then there was a further twist... I did enjoy reading this, but I always prefer my fiction firmly rooted in reality, and I felt that 'Gone Girl' moved from thriller to farce in the final few chapters. When any character becomes utterly unstoppable I feel it's past time to close their story. Surely no-one is that powerful, that scheming, that untouchable in Real Life - so why should they get away with it in fiction? Initially a fiercely compelling read, I found my desire to read on ebbed a little in the final fifth of the book as the characters' credibility was stretched too far. However, this is still well-worth a read for thriller aficionados and fans of stories with a psychological bent. Although there is a great deal of reference to the evidence that mounts against Nick, the real focus of this dark tale of deceit is the conflict that has emerged between husband and wife: its causes, its trajectory and the many petty victories claimed and endured prior to the ultimate collapse of their marriage. 'Gone Girl' is firmly a book of its time - our time - and as such I found the perspective developed on the media's relationship with victims of crime appalling and concerning; for instance, Nick was justifiably concerned that his lawyer thought it best not to tell the truth at trial because it wouldn't 'read well'. Similarly, it was interesting to read about the power-play in male-female relationships, especially (obviously) Amy and Nick's. Does 'cool girl' really exist or is she a beloved male stereotype that some unsisterly women keep alive by playing the part? Do we inevitably hate the most those who love us the most? After all, only they know the real person behind the public mask. And was it worth the hype? It was certainly worth the read."^4^January 10, 2014
PaulaKrapf, ^499845922^2^0^"This thriller is the literary equivalent of a roller coaster ride. The story unfolds in chapters that offer alternating perspectives of a husband and his wife, who went missing on their fifth anniversary. The husband is the prime suspect and he certainly seems guilty. At first. Then you think he's in the clear. Or not... And is his wife truly a spoiled, overindulged rich girl? Or is she a long-suffering soul trying to reconnect with a distant husband? Or something else entirely? You'll second-guess yourself throughout - it's that kind of book. Flynn pulls you into the story quickly. But every time you think you've figured out what's going on, who's doing what (and to whom), the shift in perspective in the next chapter makes you realize that this is no simple missing persons case. As you are drawn into the book, any allegiances you have for a particular character shift with each chapter. It all seems so basic at first, but as the characters reveal themselves nothing is as simple as it seems. I stayed up late to finish this book - it was that good, and I had to know how it was all going to end. It's one of the most fascinating and unexpected books I've ever read - the ending left me stunned."^5^June 18, 2012
BBcummings, ^499845922^2^0^"I enjoyed this book. Overall, the story is a comment on the self-absorption and selfishness of the urban young which can border on the sociopathic (in this case the female character actually is a sociopath). In fact, this novel does a better job illustrating that than Franzen's Freedom. I also like the author's treatment of the parasitic nature of the news media."^4^December 24, 2014
Beamis12, ^499845922^2^0^"I started reading this book three days ago , a book that opens with a fairly routine plot. A woman is missing and her husband is thought to be the main suspect. Fairly innocuous, but I kept reminding myself, this is Gillian Flynn and she does not do routine. Sure enough after reading this every spare chance I had, with its many twist and turns, with times I was sure I knew what was going on and where this book was going, I finished. Was blown away, I knew nothing expect awe, how does a person imagine this type of plot let alone write it so well! ARC from Netgalley"^5^March 16, 2012
arielfl, ^499845922^2^0^"I read Sharp Objects and while I liked it I didn't think it was all that. With Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn has written a novel that is all that and a bag of chips. Amy and Nick seem to have the perfect marriage but at year five it all goes to hell in an hand basket. I love the ripped from the headlines aspect to it. There were obvious shades of Scott Peterson all over the place. I could also hear Nancy Grace's shrill accusing voice coming in loud and clear in the character of Ellen Abbot. This book takes the idea of revenge to new levels. No one knows how to push your buttons quite like your spouse."^5^June 15, 2012
voracious, ^499845922^2^0^"This is a wild, suspenseful rollar coaster of a book, which alternates between a missing woman's diary and the ongoing narrative of the woman's husband, who is suspected of murdering her. As the details of Amy's disappearance are gradually and insidiously revealed, the tension of the book slowly escalates for the reader. The writing style leaves the reader unclear about what is going on for the majority of the book, as the husband, Nick, responds in a ways that could be interpreted as both guilty and innocent. As with Ms. Flynn's other novels, this storyline is dark and foreboding. I was nervous reading this book, even in the bright sunshine in the middle of the day. I fully agree with other readers that this is one of the best books of the year and I have recommended it to a number of friends. I am also looking forward to discussing this in book club, as I am curious about how others responded to the alternating storyline and the ending."^5^June 26, 2012
wmnch2fam, ^499845922^2^0^"This would have been a five star up until the final plot twist. After everything that happens. Every twist and turn and reverse and false assumption, the book ends with a twist but one that does not ring true. After dragging me onto an emotional roller coaster and threatening to throw me off, the end while surprising was not as good as the trip getting there."^5^July 29, 2014
labdaddy4, ^499845922^2^0^"The tight writing drew me in but the main characters and subject material were, for the most part, disgusting. I did not feel even the slightest tremor of sympathy for either of the primary players. I found the ending to be very unsatisfying. I do not know what would have been better - maybe a double suicide - but certainly not what the author wrote."^3^January 31, 2015
aea2142, ^499845922^2^0^"This book didn't shock me - maybe I've seen too many true crime shows, but I could anticipate Flynn's moves. It was still, however, compelling enough to keep reading and she managed to create two believable and complex narrators. The ending didn't come as a shock, but it was well done."^3^January 16, 2014

Kristelh, ^499845922^1^0^"This was an interesting tale of toxic relationship between Nick and Amy. Nick was raised by his doting mother and abusive father while Amy is the spoiled only child of two professional psychologist who made a bundle of money off books called Amazing Amy. It is told in a back and forth manner between Nick and Amy so the reader is always in one or the other's head getting their viewpoint and both narrators are very unreliable narrators. Amy goes missing and we get little segments of Nick's thoughts, little hints that there is a problem and we also get in on sections of Amy's diary. Amy has gone missing, Nick appears to be a not so nice guy and it appears he could have killed his wife. To say there are twists in this story is true. I thought one was very interesting and then the next was a little past believable. The story does pull you in and you are compelled to keep reading. Faults I have with the story would be that there is too much vulgar language that could have been done without. Definitely can see this as a movie."^4^November 16, 2013
phinz, ^499845922^1^0^"One of the best books I've read in 2013. Flynn is an amazing story crafter, keeping you in the dark at all times. Every time you think you've figured out what's going to happen she throws another curve ball at you."^5^January 26, 2014
jnavia, ^499845922^1^0^"This was great for the first three quarters or so, but it got a little too much toward the end. Too long, too convoluted.

brleach, ^499845922^1^0^"This book was deliciously twisted. Overall, it's well-written, although the prose is sometimes overwrought. In grafting literary pretensions onto the pop thriller genre, Flynn manages to create an unusual and enthralling novel, even if she doesn't quite pull it off masterfully.Many reviewers are complaining that characters were too unlikeable and that there was no one to root for, but that's one of the things I really liked about the book. Sometimes I enjoy the challenge of getting inside the head of a character that is abhorrent yet convincingly portrayed. Also, unreliable narrators are great fun when the writing is good enough to make it work, and Flynn pulls it off excellently. The first sign I was going to like the book was at the end of chapter five, when Nick says (not a big spoiler, just a hint of foreshadowing from page 37): 'It was my fifth lie to the police. I was just starting,' and the reader has no idea what he is lying about.. Amy and Nick's relationship is NOT healthy, for the record. This is not really a problem unless you think they are role models, which they really are not. And frankly, I can muster up a bit of sympathy for both Amy and Nick, even though they both have serious flaws.The plot surprised me two or three times, even though I was trying to guess where it was going the whole time. A prediction of mine that didn't come true: For a while, I thought Nick's father had done it. He kept showing up, he had been out of the nursing home on the day Amy disappeared, and he was a violent misogynist... The diary-entry Amy is really annoying to read, which makes the first part of the book a little sappy for my taste. But I see why it had to be done that way, so I found it worthwhile to slog through those bits."^4^January 26, 2015
thatotter, ^499845922^1^0^"Well, I'm not entirely sure. The writing was pretty good, but the characters (Amy especially) were so unlikable. I don't like feeling mad when I finish a book--anger while reading is fine, but not after I'm through. Uggh.Also, I guessed the plot twist--and I never guess the plot twist."^3^February 6, 2014

PiyushC, ^499845922^1^0^"A delightful read. It is difficult to not like a book like this one, with all its twists and turns, even if not perfectly executed. It reads like a Spy novel, with the exception being, there are no government conspiracies, and well, there are no spies. This book is funny where it needs to be, tragic at time, and devious almost all the times. No complaints about the writing style either, very readable, and the author does quite a good job keeping the different versions of the story separate. This is a decently long read and just when one starts to get bored, Bam! comes a twist! The first of those twists, there is no way I could have seen it coming, and neither would I am sure the majority of readers, unless they are warned of it. And no, my last statement doesn't constitute that warning. Now for the few negatives with the otherwise, did I say delightful? read. Remember when I said, *just when one starts to get bored*, well, make it *a little time after the reader has started to get bored* - point being, the aforementioned twists could have been timed better. There is also a bit of redundancy, some of the sub-plots, the book could have done very well without; a more compact book would have definitely got more pointers from me."^4^December 29, 2013
LadyLiz, ^499845922^1^0^"This is one of those books that you just can't put down. I started it, thinking it was going to be the usual, missing wife, husband did it kind of story. (I've opted to hide this review because of the possibility of spoilers. I think I was very careful not to include anything too obvious, but someone who is particularly intuitive might be able to figure out some important points...if they are very, very good at guessing games.)We meet Nick and immediately see that he has become disenfranchised with his marriage...but as the story continues, and we see the relationship from both sides, it becomes more and more difficult to determine who is the good guy. I particularly like that we see it from Nick's point of view in the now, but we get to see Amy's point of view build up to that point. We get to see the relationship bloom and wither and reignite, although from a somewhat skewed point of view. But the point when the two time frames meet is very intense! Twist upon twist! My only complaint would be that I am not 100% satisfied with the ending. I think it is the only possible ending for this book; any other ending would have led to a cliche, and this book goes out of it's way to make fun of cliches, so that wouldn't do. I began to sense the inevitable twist that was coming about 20 pages from the end, and kept reading because the rest of the book had kept me on the edge of my seat so well, I couldn't believe that it would end in the way I expected. But, alas, it did, leaving me with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. I wanted vindication for the characters, and instead, the characters took the somewhat easy road. Albeit, it was definitely not the easy out for the author, and she handled it well. It's just not exactly the sort of ending that leaves you particularly liking any of the characters.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book. Once I actually got into the story (about 10 pages in), I couldn't put it down. I literally stayed up nearly all night to get to an acceptable 'stopping point.' Then, when I twisted my ankle and couldn't go to work, I thought myself lucky because I could finish the book. It is that kind of good."^4^November 25, 2014

A story of a marriage, personality disorders, reaction, needs, desires, realities and everything that can challenge your ideas of what is acceptable or not.I see this book as showing that; at first you feel for the wife, then the husband, which leads you to think of a conclusion that some marriages are merely acting which bind couples together through their own failings.Flynn manages to make you feel that you like the characters, even when you dislike their behaviour.An excellent read."^5^November 20, 2014

LauraT81, ^499845922^1^0^"It seems to me that readers either love or hate Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's psychological thriller that is buzzing. I can say, wholeheartedly, that I am one of the lovers. At first, the story is engaging, but seems more of a tale of a marriage that is in trouble. But when Nick comes home to find his wife, Amy, missing on their fifth wedding anniversary, the novel ignites into a mystery that takes a wicked turn. I have to take a moment to say that the haters are usually hating the ending (no worries; I won't reveal anything), but I found it fitting and a bit creepy in the scheme of things. Amazing, thrilling fun! Don't take my word for it, read it."^5^June 5, 2014
Joanne53, ^499845922^1^0^"It was entertaining. it was suspenseful. At times intense. But the take away for me was that these two characters were impossible to like, deserved each other, and will mutually distruct. And I don't care."^3^November 15, 2014

Kuroonehalf, ^499845922^1^0^"Since this thing doesn't support decimal scores I think I'll settle with a 5 as opposed to a 4. It does have a couple flaws but none of them are serious enough to topple the cool things this book does.One of them might just be my own fault, for expecting more twists than there were. There is one infamous twist that is genuinely great, but asides from that it's fairly tame in that regard.The other issue, and this is an issue I have with a lot of books, is the rigid structure of the story, mechanically switching between the protagonists every few pages. Often times I couldn't help but feel slightly pulled out of the action, having to rearrange a few mental gears so I could progress. I'm not sure how the book could be executed without this structure but I thought I should mention it as it was one of the few things that put a break on my enjoyment.Overall I feel like it's a pretty great book that doesn't disappoint if you're looking for a good psychological thriller."^5^November 22, 2014
Sarahn78, ^499845922^1^0^"I love this book!!! Inventive storytelling and a helluva premise. The first chapter is told from the husband's perspective when his wife goes missing. The chapters alternate from his perspective while trying to find out what happened to his wife, to excerpts from the wife's diary from the day they meet to the present day (when she disappears). Halfway through, the entire book turns upside down with a twist I am not ashamed to say I didn't see coming at all. Very well developed characters, even if they weren't entirely likeable at any time. Great writing kept the book going at break-neck speed. I recommend this book to anyone!!"^5^December 1, 2013

However as the book progresses towards the second half I became enthralled. Once the twist is revealed the book flowed fast.

BeckyGandee, ^499845922^1^0^"So much talk about how good this book is and that they will be making a movie out of it, I had to read it. Gone Girl was definitely not what I expected, it was so crazy and disturbing, but for some reason I just couldn't stop reading. Amy and Nick are both selfish and just completely awful to each other (Amy was a a lot worse than Nick). Amy really needed some help, she was so awful and vindictive. What Nick did was very bad, but the way she handled everything was completely crazy and just plain evil. How could you do all the evil she did? Just proves that evidence is not what it always seems to be, especially when I messed up in the head person is involved. Anyways, I have to say it was a good read in the sense that I couldn't put the book down, I just had to know what happened and how things ended up. I was really baffled at the way the book ended, definitely not how I thought it would at all."^4^November 14, 2013
ShavonJones, ^499845922^1^0^"I found it wickedly captivating. A very good read. I see it as a movie in that psycho Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, Fatal Attraction family, though the only similarity between Gone Girl and those movies is that the female leads are all crazy. If you look at most stories about crazy women, they are usually written by men. So I guess it's nice to see that women writers have warped views of women too? There is a loud voice of sweet women who don't like this book because the characters are not redeemable. I tend to like (and write) redeemable characters too, but in real life, there are some people who are past the point of redemption.

Nick is a writer who is currently creating questionnaires for a magazine. Amy is the daughter and inspiration for her parents' series of books 'Amazing Amy'. Both are extremely good-looking and make a beautiful couple. Nick and Amy live in New York and they both lose their jobs weeks apart from each other. Nick receives a phone call from his sister, Margo (Go), that their mother is ill and needs to be cared for. Nick and Amy move back to Nick's hometown in Missouri. This is when the trouble between Nick and Amy begins. Nick has found Amy to be intolerably picky and has co-purchased a bar that he runs with his sister, 'The Bar'. From this point, the shenanigans get very serious. Amy devises plans, Nick falls into traps. This is psychological thriller par none. The scheming and game-playing are mind-bending.

SteveLindahl, ^499845922^1^0^"There is a Maddie Crum article in The Huffingtonpost entitled 8 Popular Books With Deeply Disappointing Endings. Gone Girl is one of the titles she listed. I was halfway through the novel when I noticed the piece, so I didn't read it at the time. Now that I've finished the book I've gone back to see if I agree with Crum's premise. She has a primary reason why she doesn't like the ending and a different reason, just as strong, why she does. So, without mentioning what those arguments are, I will say I agree with her detail, but I don't agree with her putting the book on her list. There were times when I was reading the ending that I felt like yelling 'Please stop this!' because a number of conclusions were reached and after each one, the plot would keep on going. But the final choice was brilliant. I've read elsewhere that Gillian Flynn intends to 'tweak' the ending for the movie. It will be interesting to see what she does. The nature of translating a book to the screen forces the story to be shortened, so I think my complaint will be handled automatically. I worry about other changes. I'm rating Gone Girl as a five star book, despite some aspects I didn't like. I already mentioned how long the ending seemed. I thought some of the foul language was indulgent and sometimes given to characters I didn't feel would use it. And there were many moments when characters knew things they couldn't possibly know and other times when they reacted in ways I found hard to believe. But the story is incredibly intense (Amy's parents would say amazingly intense) and unique. The way Flynn takes two despicable characters, mixes in tremendous lies, and still has me sympathizing with them both is simply great. There is truth about relationships in this book. It's exaggerated, twisted, ignored at times and lied about at other times, but it is still truth and for that reason I care about Nick and Amy even as I feel their hatred and frustration. I picked an excellent time to read Gone Girl because the film is due out in October. I can't wait to see it. Steve Lindahl - author of Motherless Soul and White Horse Regressions"^5^July 19, 2014

But I can honestly say that I have NEVER read a book like 'Gone Girl' in my life. This book messes with the reader's head in a most interesting and addictive way. (Let me say here that before I even finished this book, I ordered another one of Flynn's books.) Amy and Nick Dunne are completely fascinating and wildly unnerving characters. Though the plot of their story dances up to the line of seeming too contrived at times - it never crosses it. Flynn makes this story work because she's created such unique and amazingly enough, believable characters. Reading about these people, this marriage, is like trying to make one's way though a fun house maze of mirrors. Every time you think you know the way out, you walk straight into a wall. When Amy and Nick meet - it seems magical. 'Click. You just know each other. All of a sudden you see reading in bed and waffles on Sunday and laughing at nothing and his mouth on yours. And it's so far beyond fine that you know you can never go back to fine. That fast. You think: Oh, here is the rest of my life. It's finally arrived.' After five years of marriage pass, things are more than a bit different. 'When she spied me lurking there in grubby boxers, my hair in full Heat Miser spike, she leaned against the kitchen counter and said, 'Well, hello, handsome.' Bile and dread inched up my throat. I thought to myself: Okay, go.' But turns out? Almost nothing the reader reads in the first third of the book is true. Well, I can't say that. It's true to a point, except when one of the characters clearly admits lying to the reader. And then there are lies within lies...and twists upon twists. As Amy explains, 'Don't fret, we'll sort this out: the true and the not true and the might as well be true.' It is often said that no one really knows what goes on within a marriage except the two people involved in it. In this case, these two people don't even really know. This book is a mix of lies, truths, half truths and fabrications. Amy and Nick Dunne aren't very honest to the reader, and even less so to themselves. But it's less confusing than intriguing...less far-fetched than fascinating. I had to put it down a few times to try and wrap my head around what was going on, but when I had to put it down for a final time, it was with dismay. I can only hope the Gillian Flynn book I ordered arrives soon."^5^March 25, 2012
Nobrun, ^463804^1^0^"Very well rounded story. You become familiar with the characters very early on. The story ties together very well in the end. This book has the best ending I have ever read - once you've gotten to know the characters, you want to know what happened after the last incident in the story. This book jumps to 10 years later and gives you the 'current' scoop - a where-are-they-now ending.

Why 4 stars? The book is set in New York City (which I like) but a lot is spent on descriptive writing. E.g. if the character is traveling from one location to another, the 'narrator' tells every avenue and street used (could be up to five), every left or right turn made and every traffic light that is red. Too much."^4^April 19, 2013

It only took me 2 days to read the first one. Can't wait until the third book is released in July."^5^June 13, 2010
1Rebec, ^11022454^1^0^"Loved this book just like every other James Patterson book! The text of the book is not as exotic as the name. It has only a few pages of adult scenes. It has several twist and you are always guessing!"^5^January 12, 2013
MaryKathleen, ^11022454^1^0^"This book is one of those books that caught my attention from the first to the last chapters. It gave twists and turns that kept my eyes and mind glued to the letters on the page... If you like stories that are suspenseful and surprising then you'll love this one...
I give my applause to James Patterson and Michael Ledwidge..."^5^February 25, 2010
Trennary, ^54969952^10^0^"Enjoyed this very much.  

On the one hand, it was formulaic Dan Brown--but wouldn't we be disappointed if he veered off from his usual course?  And by the end of the prologue and chapter one, you have the clues needed (if you paid strict attention) to solve the 'who done it' (well, who was responsible, at any rate).  There was much more description--of buildings, religion, science--than plot action in this book. 

However, it was still a page turner (I was up most of one night, finishing the last couple of hundred pages).  The story was interesting, the resolution creative.  

Do read it with your laptop or Ipad at your side--you simply MUST look up the amazing architectural wonders Dan Brown visits.  They are incredible.  

I'd sum up by saying--don't expect anything but traditional Dan Brown.  Don't expect his best book ever (will anything top The Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons?).  But Origin is a book that will entertain while it informs.  Enjoy."^4^October 17, 2017
