Kimlyann, ^471792^2^0^"I am a long time fan of the Tintin books. I had the entire set of 3 in 1 Tintin books, but I loaned a few out that never made it back to me. When I decided to just replace them, the volumes had been rereleased with new covers. I was so excited to see the older ones here on Walmart.com. However, when I got them, they are the new cover and a slightly smaller size (they do not match what is pictured here). So my collection is complete, but it just doesn't look very uniform. For content, I can't complain. I still love the unrealistic but wonderfully entertaining adventures of Tintin!"^3^January 19, 2015

Clif, ^15563951^2^0^"Wuthering Heights is a story of people behaving badly. If all of English gentry were so utterly psychotic, selfish, and inward focused as depicted in this book, England would have never had an empire. I've heard second hand from a literature professor that students either like or hate Wuthering Heights, few are indifferent. I'm in the hate Wuthering Heights category. If it weren't for its reputation as a classic of English literature I would have given it only one star. As a matter of fact, if the book hadn't of been selected for discussion by a book group I belong to, I would have never finished the book. So how can I explain the thinking of people who place this book in the Western Literary Canon? At a basic level it is about a passionate, yet thwarted, love between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and how this unresolved passion eventually destroys them and many around them. The parts of the story that are hard to stomach are the stark depictions of mental and physical cruelty. And it's more than just a part of the book; the cruel and insensitive human relations continue page-after-page for the whole book except for the very end. Since it's a product of the 19th Century we can rest assured that in the end the book will be resolved in a satisfactory moral lesson. So what moral lessons do I find in this book? 1. Decisions made based on class can lead to regrettable results. Class is a major consideration in Catherine's decision not to marry Heathcliff. This becomes a regretted decision because of the shifting nature of social status demonstrated by Heathcliff's up-and-down trajectory from homeless waif to gentleman. 2. Mistreatment of children can lead to multiple generations of negative relationships. Heathcliff is mistreated as a child and ends up dedicating his life to achieving revenge. 3. An isolated ingrown upper class leads to weak leadership. The characters in this book all seem to be dying young, and are emotionally fragile. The primary marriage candidates in this book are first cousins. (It's interesting to note that the Brontë sisters all died young. I wonder if there were married cousins in their ancestry.) 4. In the end, love can conquer all. Some symbolism I noticed in the book: 1. The weather becomes threatening whenever a crucial plot encounter was about to occur (dark and stormy night style). 2. The surrounding moors offer a threatening environment that lends additional suspense to the story's action. 3. Ghosts appear throughout the narrative in Wuthering Heights which creates a foreboding atmosphere (but they are presented in an ambiguous way so their reality remains in question). 4. The threats from nature and the supernatural implied by the above symbols transfers its symbolic associations onto the Catherine-Heathcliff love affair. I guess if you like gothic novels, this one fits the bill. But frankly, if you like this book I think there's something twisted about your personality. That's said with a smile ; ) on my face. Read in December, 2008"^2^January 8, 2009
SlySionnach, ^15563951^2^0^"I finished this book at 8 am this morning and I'm still not sure about what to say. Another attempt at reading romance (Gothic, classic romance at that) that I enjoyed but am not sure about the main characters. No one in the novel was completely likable. Every since person from Nelly to Catherine to Heathcliff to even Edgar had something off about them that made one's heart not commit 100% to loving any character. Arguments could be made, of course, but the fact that every person had a negative side almost made the novel too realistic. But I will never hate something too realistic. The way the story is told - through another story in classic frame style - reminds me of sitting around a fireplace with my family, listening to stories of my parents'/uncles'/aunts' past. Easy to read and always engaging, the reader will fly through the pages wanting to know more gossip, just like any old washerwoman. Parts will horrify you, parts will touch your heart, and by the end, hopefully you've been satisfied. I was, as was the man who the story was told to, Mr. Lockwood. On a whole, I enjoyed the story despite my want to strangle some characters and ignore some others. Only one character - Joseph - made me want to kill him. But to feel so strongly about characters is to have an attachment to them and I can honestly say that by the end of the novel, I wanted to know what happened. I needed to know. Definitely a book to recommend. Perhaps not to the younger crowd, but high school age and above works for me."^5^August 4, 2010
Katie_H, ^15563951^1^0^"Oh boy. I have no idea where the love for this angsty novel comes from. I'm glad that I waited until adulthood to read it, because I know I wouldn't have given it half a chance in high school. The classic story tells the tale of Heathcliff, an unfortunate orphan who is adopted by Catherine's family. He and Catherine fall in love, and their forbidden love is doomed from the start, darkening Heathcliff's heart, and leading him to hatefully seek revenge on her entire family. NONE of these characters are loveable, and I would argue that none of them are even likeable. Heathcliff is a nightmarish beast and Catherine is petty and selfish. Their flaws are so numerous that it was impossible for me to get emotionally invested in any of the characters. This is supposed to be a classic love story, but where is the love? Where is the kindness? The patience? The sharing and caring? OK, so I've read this 'masterpiece' once, and I'm glad I did, due to the many Heathcliff/Catherine references in pop culture, but now that the last page is turned, I'm glad to be rid of these people."^3^April 17, 2011
spreckles, ^15563951^1^0^"I really can't understand why people like this book. The characters are all awful. I can't sympathize with any of them and I don't believe it's a love story at all. Catherine and Heathcliff aren't capable of loving anyone besides themselves. All they do is whine and moan and throw fits. One of the worst books I've ever read."^1^March 8, 2010
kissmeimgone, ^15563951^1^0^"This book took a bit longer than I had hoped to get into due to the old fashioned writing of its time. However, once I started truly getting into the plot of the story, I found it hard to put down. Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte, is a tale of a love that never dies. Catherine Earnshaw makes a fatal decision to marry not out of love, but out of want for money and leaves her soul mate and childmate Heathcliff in the dust. Upon trying to renew their love while being married, Catherine finally dies of a broken heart, realizing she made the wrong choice so long ago and had no way of fixing that. I defintley recommend this book to those who so strongly believe in love still being alive long after the person whom they have loved has died."^4^August 14, 2011
marthaearly, ^15563951^1^0^"This book, for me, suffered from the half & half issue. Sometimes with any work of art, I find myself loving one half and hating another. I was wholly drawn into the first half of Emily Bronte's epic tale of obsession, with its grand gothic trappings and detail. However, after Catherine's death I found my enthusiasm wavering at having to absorb, in detail, the growth of young Cathy when I had little interest in her, especially since Heathcliff's presence lessens at this point. I was angry to be robbed of Catherine and Heathcliff's tortured romance, but eventually came to realize the complexity of Heathcliff's animosity towards the world Catherine willingly entered, and the extent of his desire to completely dismantle it. The second half is harder, for sure, but I cannot say that the final payoff is not without merit. I was especially touched by Heathcliff's final confession as his life draws to a close. Upon witnessing the affection between young Cathy and Hareton he realizes that in the presence of love, a love denied him and Cathy, his ability to hate and despise any longer is compromised. That message, that love has ultimate power over malice and hatred and can redeem all, is beautifully rendered at book's end.Readers should be clear on one point: Heathcliff and Catherine are obsessed with each other in a way that does little favor to anyone when it is romanticized, especially since this wicked bond between the two fosters all the anger and hate that ruins lives as the novel progresses. However, it is this tension between the two, even in death, that drives this complex, often difficult, but rewarding novel."^4^June 6, 2014
Enamoredsoul, ^15563951^1^0^"Written by Emile Bronte in a time where love was astute, bare, controlled, even calculated - Wuthering Heights is a book that is full of unruly passion, sweeping romance, epic betrayals and vengeful drama. It is no wonder that during the life of the author, she never received the satisfaction of knowing what a classic she had written - it was only after the reprinting of her novel, posthumous, that Emily Bronte received the praise that she deserved, for a book that deserves much more than a praise. I read 'Wuthering Heights' often - not because I believe in I believe in the dramatics of love, but simply because I believe in it. Love, that is. Wuthering Heights is full of characters who are morally bankrupt, and despicable to the core - but you cannot help but feel for them anyway. One moment you feel sorry for Heathcliff, and with the turn of a page, are filled with such hatred for him. But that an author can create such convincing characters, that they can evoke such emotions in you, is what makes this book so special. For me it's a lesson, that when one finds love, one must look past the color, the creed, the caste and the credentials to embrace what you have found - for if you let it go, you will break your own heart, and in the process, bring pain to all hearts enjoined with yours. A classic tale, about love, friendship and betrayal - a must read."^5^February 6, 2011
MarianneHusbands, ^15563951^1^0^"Wuthering Heights has been in my consciousness ever since the 70's when Kate Bush was wailing out her high pitched ethereal lyrics - Out on the wiley, windy moors We'd roll and fall in green. You had a temper like my jealousy: Too hot, too greedy. How could you leave me, When I needed to possess you? I hated you. I loved you, too. I watched the TV adaptaion with Tom Hardy some years ago and still have vague recollections of it - mostly of Tom Hardy's brooding gorgeousness. And as I have said before seeing any tv or film adaptation before reading the book for me is a mistake. When I first started reading I found myself trying to link in the story to what I had seen and thought I already knew which detracted somewhat for allowing the story to unfold. What surprised me most on reading was it wasn't all about Cathy and Heathcliff as my memory had held it. So much of this tale is about the children of the initial characters. If there is any place for pathetic fallacy in literature then Wuthering Heights is the perfect venue. Not only does the weather provide the sometimes wild, sometimes brooding, sometimes oppressive atmosphere of the book but for me it is also a metaphor for the characters themselves. Many like myself come to the story thinking it will be a tale of love and passion only to discover that the pervading emotions are childish petulance and hatred and revenge. I have learnt much about life and love in nearly half a century on the planet and one thing I have learnt is that, when it comes to human relationships, hate is not the opposite of love - apathy is. So for me there is still more love in the story than hatred. It just manifests itself in an immature way. When I think of Heathcliff then the word repression comes to mind. I was once told that Wuthering Heights is best read when young and I can see why - there is for me is an immaturity in Cathy Earnshaw's behaviour in particular. The amazing thing for me about Wuthering Height's is held in the author herself - how on earth did a young woman in victorian England come up with all of this? The initial reviews of the book were not favourable and critics thought it morally reprehensible drivel. I need to find out more about Emily Bronte and her life and experiences - ooh a trip to Haworth when I am next back up in the Motherland. I have the 1939 film adaptation waiting with Larry O and Merle Oberon which I will watch with interest - although a more unlikely Heathcliff I cannot imagine. And a final note - having seen Tom Hardy digging up Cathy from her grave to embrace her again like a deranged lunatic ( my favourite scene ) I was eaer for it to come up in the book - it was there at last, so very near the end although the writing of it a very different less urgent account than the one I experienced in viewing."^5^February 4, 2017
PhilSyphe, ^15563951^1^0^"I enjoyed my second visit to 'Wuthering Heights' more than the first. This is partly because my first read was spread out over 4 -6 weeks (I think in 2005, though it could've been a couple of years either way), whereas my second read took 6 days, commencing from Emily Brontë's 200th birthday, which is why I thought I'd give it another look. I was also less enthused during my first read because I'd previously watched numerous adaptations of 'Wuthering Heights' over the years, with all but one (which I saw after reading the novel) skipping much, if not all, of the story's second half. In short, my expectations were that this tale would revolve around Cathy and Heathcliff's unique relationship. In a sense it does (won't add more in case I spoil things for anyone), but from about halfway through, we see other characters emerge who rarely appear in most screen adaptations. Another pre-reading influence was Kate Bush's song 'Wuthering Heights', which I've always loved, and this also made me think the main theme would be Heathcliff and Cathy's passion for each other. Therefore, during my first read I felt a little disappointed that their relationship wasn't as emphasised as expected. When I approached 'Wuthering Heights' for a second time, I knew what to expect, though after such a long gap since I first read it, I'd naturally forgotten a lot, especially events in the second half. This is by no means a beautiful love story, but rather a bleak tale of sadness, loneliness, loss, cruelty, and misery, yet it's not entirely devoid of hope. I admire how the author structured the narrative. It's multi-first person, predominantly told by Nelly and Mr Lockwood, with smaller parts filled in by other characters. It all blends in very well together, and what makes the narrative's construction even more impressive is that it's not strictly linear. This type of thing can often prove messy, but Emily Brontë handles it smoothly. One review I saw criticises 'Wuthering Heights' for have no sense of place. This I must disagree with. In fact, I consider the sense of place as one of the book's great strengths. I could vividly 'see' the moors, the landscape, plus the rooms at the Heights and at the Grange. My only real criticism is Joseph's dialogue. Although I'm a Yorkshireman myself, much of Joseph's broad dialect took some understanding - and the odd phrase I couldn't fathom out - and overall his dialogue really slows the narrative down. I imagine anyone outside of Yorkshire - and even more so anyone outside of England - would have immense trouble understanding Joseph. An interesting aspect to this story is of course the supernatural element. I suspect anyone who hasn't read this book has at least seen an adaptation where, at the end, Cathy and Heathcliff reunite after death. I was actually disappointed this wasn't developed to a similar extent in the book, as it's something special in the well-done adaptations where we see these thwarted lovers reunited. In the novel, however, their reunion is more of a casual reference. It's still a poignant moment - or moments - though, and reading it for the second time I appreciated it more than the first. We also see Mr Lockwood endure a supernatural encounter at a window early on, which is one of my favourite scenes, and an important one. I don't always appreciate the supernatural seeping in to novels that are essentially 'real life', but in this case, the supernatural parts not only feel believable, they also add hope to a tragic story. Without the afterlife moments, 'Wuthering Heights' wouldn't hit the mark in the same way. The ending would've been too depressing. As it is, we're left with hope for the living and for the dead. While I feel Heathcliff and Cathy's story is the novel most appealing element, I do like the story which revolves around the new characters featured in the second half, and how they interact with Heathcliff's deceptive and despicable nature. In fact, my favourite character is the younger Catherine. She, along with Hareton and Isabella, are the three who I feel the most sympathy towards. Most of the misery in this story stems from Heathcliff's actions, though the likes of Hindley and Joseph don't exactly spread light into the world. It's hard to feel sympathy for many of the characters because of their selfishness and unkindness. It's debateable whether Cathy is more selfish than Heathcliff. Despite Heathcliff affecting more people's lives for the worst, much - if not all - of this is through Cathy and her brother Hindley's treatment of Heathcliff during his youth. While Hindley causes Heathcliff physical and mental torment, Cathy's brand of mental anguish is surely worse. I don't think Cathy does this deliberately, as she's too self-absorbed to realise how her motives will devastate Heathcliff. The younger Catherine comes across as selfish and haughty many times, but I like her because deep down she has a good heart and she's a bright character in a dark world. She's horrible to poor Hareton, who deserves better, yet she goes out of her way to help Linton, who doesn't deserve her attention. Linton, in my opinion, is the most detestable character of all. Granted, some of his behaviour is owing to Heathcliff's influence, but at heart Linton is a spineless, self-obsessed creature. Heathcliff, whatever you think of him, is a fascinating character. The whole story pretty much revolves around his treatment of others, and how others treat or perceive him. He has that 'lost soul' element about him, with his origins shrouded in mystery. I commend the author for creating such a vivid and memorable character. I originally rated 'Wuthering Heights' four stars when I added it to my Goodreads shelf in 2013. This was based on reading it circa 2005. After finishing it again in August 2018, I felt four stars was a fair rating; however, the characters and various scenes from the book have stayed with in the subsequent days. Not many novels have this type of potency to 'haunt' me, so on reflection, I feel 'Wuthering Heights' deserves five stars."^5^August 4, 2018
roslynbui, ^15563951^1^0^"This is my all time favourite book! It contains every genre - romance, mystery, supernatural, discrimination and differentiation of class, status quo, psychology...I even included a quote from this on my wedding candle: 'Whatever souls are made of, his and mine are the same'."^5^March 6, 2009
HunyBadger, ^53631715^4^0^"I had never really liked the storyline before reading but having never formally read it I felt it was unwise to judge. I hoped this could be a turning point, where reading would make me enjoy it finally. Sadly, while reading, I couldn't wait to be finished! I only somewhat liked the last two chapters. Nothing made any sense and even the puns, which might have been interesting, were so annoyingly redundant that I only grew exasperated with the whole thing. Like a child that keeps asking why, this story goes around in circles, never finding a solid base to stand on. I find there are specific kinds of silliness, silly-stupid and silly-zany, for instance. I think silly-zany was the goal but I only find it silly-stupid. Now that I've read the book, I am sad to admit that I still don't know what others find amusing about it."^1^June 2, 2010
the_terrible_trivium, ^53631715^2^0^"Swift-moving, extremely funny, and pretty much unique (aside from the second one). Gleefully absurd, always inches away from flying off the handle, which it would do if the handle didn't fly off first."^5^April 12, 2007
sadiekaycarver, ^53631715^1^0^"Written as if the writer is on an acid trip, this book is wonderful and frightening at the same time. Rereading it as an adult has made me realize why I was so scared as a child. Alice, The White Rabbit, The Red Queen, The Mad Hatter....all these characters come to life in great detail and description. I would recomend this to anyone who has seen the many movies made. It's strange, wonderful and fun all in one."^4^September 28, 2011
ctpress, ^53631715^1^0^"'We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.' The Chesire cat to Alice What delightful wonderous nonsense. To spend 2 hours and 44 minutes listening to Scarlett Johansson's joyful narration of 'Alice in Wonderland' was like a breeze of fresh air for my overworked brain. 'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin... but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!' Is it subversive nonsense? Filled with hidden meanings? Cleverly organised and meticulously metered out nonsense? Maybe...I don't know - overblown psychoanalytical interpretations kill the wonder of it all - and it's original intention: The enchanted nonsense of a child's imagination. As the forever tea party - where Alice ponders: 'The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.' And it's certainly a 'curious dream' I will revisit again and again. Scarlett, we have a date next year for another 2 hours and 44 minutes."^4^February 15, 2017
adpaton, ^53631715^1^0^"The most over-rated book of all time in my opinion - in the face of stiff opposition from Pilgrim's Progress and Catcher in the Rye, to name but a few. I was both bored and disturbed by the claustophobic and nightmarish nonsensity of this messy fever dream of ghastly characters. The mad hatter, that terrible queen, all those odd substances saying eat me and drink me, then swimming through the sea of dormouse tears - most off-putting. Mind you, that might have been 'Through the Looking Glass', possibly the only book I hated even more than Wonderland."^2^August 4, 2009
emvuu, ^53631715^1^0^"This has to be the most intricate read and imaginatively inspiring books that I have ever come across. There is so much action occurring during Alice's time through the rabbit whole that explaining it would never be as satisfying as reading it. Each character occupies only small sections of the book but they are so memorable, so fascinating and different that one can not forget who they are, their story, and where they've come from. Alice herself is very smart for her age (9 I do believe?) and questions every question that a character throws at her. She does not fuss over small matters but instead opts through out the book to accept the differences. Carroll's characters make a lot of good points, their words have different meanings to it making the reader rethink about what they've just read. I nodded my head many times. Carroll is one for play on words and thinking outside the box about words, letters, and much much more. Through The Looking Glass may have been even more elaborate with Alice's encounter with the White Queen and her journey through an imaginary chess board to reach the status of Queen. There is so much more significant moments in the book that I want to comment on but it may just become an entire essay. This is a classic, the classic I've heard so much about and so glad I spent the time to read!"^5^October 30, 2009
BooGirl, ^53631715^1^0^"Being a big fan of the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland I had high expectations when I picked up this book but I was surprisingly disappointed. I found Alice to be quite the little annoyance. Much more 'childish' than I expected. I also found myself bored of the novel half way through. I understand this is a children's story but the writing was not as I had expected from a novel that is considered a classic. The concept of the story is brilliant beyond words and has the greatest potential to be amazing and yet the writing was flat and at times awkward to read. This is the first novel-turned-movie, that I actually prefer the movie over the actual novel."^1^February 18, 2010
FrankErrington, ^53631715^1^0^"Really a children's book, but I love the imaginative story telling and the whimsical dialogue. None of the films have ever done it justice. If you only know this tale through movies, do yourself a favor and read the book. Better yet, read it to a child ;-)"^4^November 4, 2010
Matie, ^53631715^1^0^"I really like this book a lot. Every tome I read it I find more fun details and images in it. The illustrations in this edition, however, did very little to bring out those clever details that Carroll so specifically included. The world of Wonderland is very proper within this book. The chairs at the Mad Hatter's table all match (which the text says they do not) and other such mistakes. In fact, there are a great number of detail mistakes in this book, some of them not so trivial. The one that irritated me the most was that the gardeners who were painting the roses red were hearts when they are supposed to be spades (I happen to really like that detail, so it bugs me). The mistakes are distracting and any kid will pick them out immediately, which isn't a good thing! This edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is illustrated by Foreman in watercolours. Supposedly the artist was trying to mimic Carroll's photography, but other than Alice's hair and dress there is very little evidence of that. Getting beyond nit picky details (which I admit, I tend to get hung up on sometimes), the illustrations still seem to lack the originality and magic necessary for the story. The author specifically draws the real world in sepia tones while Wonderland is in colour, but rather than adding anything to this story the technique just feels copied and overdone since it is a very common motif. Mr. Foreman states in the back of the book that every illustrator must undertake Alice's Adventures in Wonderland at some point in their career. This makes me wonder if he really loved the book and thus wanted to illustrate it or if he felt like he should because it was expected. I don't know. That might explain the lack of magic, though. I don't really recommend this book. I would do in a pinch, but there are many editions that are much better with far more wonderful illustrations (even Tenniel's original drawings are better). Thus, I don't recommend this book. If you need an edition of Alice, find a better one!"^3^August 30, 2007
slarsoncollins, ^53631715^1^0^"OK, so maybe I haven't taken enough drugs in my life, but this book was a bit much for me. I enjoyed some of the story, and the wordplay was amusing in parts, but I have a hard time figuring out who this book is meant for. I don't think it's a very good children's story as they won't understand most of what's happening, especially as it pertains to the Mad Hatter and March Hare. I don't think it's a very good story for adults either, as it is fairly simple and doesn't have much of a plot or any character development to speak of. It's fun, but that's about it. This is one of the few books that I've ever felt made a better movie. And whether it's the Disney version, or the one with Johnny Depp, I think both were superior to the book. JMHO."^2^July 6, 2011
Amberlynn.Avery, ^53631715^1^0^"This is my boyfriend's favorite book, but quickly became one of mine, as well. I think that it was well written, funny, and there's a lot to take from it. In the end, I could go on and on about how much Alice seemed like a little brat, or how the mad tea party is my favorite scene, but that would make this review much bulkier than I would like. However, I would have to say that the story is able to be read over and over, which I have done."^5^March 3, 2012

Caonima, ^53631715^1^0^"This story tells of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world.She met lots of strange crature,and taught them lots of interesting things.But shi also learned some things from these people.Maybe you feel that it just belongs to fairy tale,and for children only.However,as a part of young people,i think this story is excellent.I gained much imagination from it,i found the way of making our lives become more meaningful.As a result,you won't miss it if you are the person who love the life."^5^March 10, 2011

ecataldi, ^53631715^1^0^"Ugh, I hate nonsense books. I get that this is for kids and the whole premise is fun nonsense. When Alice falls asleep she goes down into a rabbit hole and enters Wonderland, a place where everything is fun and nonsense. There is no point to anything and everyone is weird and can you tell how much I dislike this book. There is no plot, just a dumb kid named Alice, wandering around Wonderland talking to animals and packs of cards, playing croquet with flamingos and the like. Totally bonkers."^2^June 28, 2018
