Just wish there was a sequel to this story. Excellent!!"^5^July 18, 2010
SherryAnne, ^43378712^16^0^"It is so-o-o worth it. I have not put the 1st book down since I got it. After I saw the first season on Starz And ordered the dvd through walmart.com. I had to read the books to see how the author developed the characters. Book to screen is always different. It is just not possible to show your personal experience with a book on screen. Both versions are fantastic! I have not read a book in over 40 years."^5^July 7, 2015
trubiemom, ^43378712^3^2^"I love the way these books are written and the stories that they hold. Once you begin reading, you become completely engrossed in the period and in the character lives and you just have to continue to the next book to see how their story unveils."^5^May 9, 2016

MrGinger, ^438978^5^0^"If you have not read 1984 but have read other dystopian novels like Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, Anthem, Erewhon, or even the Hunger Games trilogy or V For Vendetta, but want more of this genre, 1984 is a must!"^5^May 19, 2014
Rilay, ^438978^4^2^"This book won’t control your mind, but it does have a lot to do with mind control. 1984 is a book written by George Orwell in 1949 depicting what Orwell believed that England would look like in the future. This book depicts a “Utopian” society that is ruled with an iron fist by the government who uses propaganda to control the population. Propaganda like “Big Brother is watching” is displayed on signs so that citizens know that the government is always watching and that the Thought Police are monitoring thoughts through “Tele-screens” (televisions). These Thought Police are used to track rebels who want to destroy the totalitarian government and bring freedom to the people.

The main character, Winston Smith, works for the government but sees the injustices going on around him. Winston breaks little rules here and there like writing a journal even though this is forbidden by the Thought Police. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth; a government building that changes history by “erasing” events from the past by changing photos, editing books, and completely removing people from history. The Ministry of Truth does this to control the knowledge of past successful rebel uprisings.

This is a great book that gives a lot of insight on what life is like in our society, even if we don’t recognize it on a daily basis. Orwell wasn't completely right with the date, however, I feel that our society is slowly reaching the point in which this book will no longer be “Fiction”. I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a story with a deep history and speculation. I had a great time reading this and i think you will too."^4^December 14, 2014

Crystal, ^45761465^46^4^"My fault for not reading the dimensions before purchasing. And although they are very nice. I love the 'leather'covers and the colors. They would be great for display if they were regular sized. However these books are tiny. Similar to the size of a child's bible. I can not comfortably read it. If you are looking for average sized books these are not for you."^3^May 17, 2016

Laysee, ^19532376^3^3^"I ordered this book for school, unfortunately having to use a gift card I had received as a birthday present. What a waste of money. I got the book today, and while opening it, I noticed black marks all over the cover. Upon further inspection of the book, I found more markings on the back. I will still use this for school, seeing I have no other option. But I am not happy and it was not worth the waste of my gift card."^2^January 18, 2013

LateReader123, ^19532376^2^0^"Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, who wakes up the reality of his actions. Along the way, he encounters those that the State regards as dissidents and the keys to the future that they hold. While this story was written in the 1950s, the relevance of its message is just as sobering, just as powerful, in 2013 as it was six decades ago. This was the first Ray Bradbury book that I have read, and I was not disappointed."^3^September 30, 2013
Azfrog75, ^3362627^5^0^"The only review I have is for the shipping. Free shipping site to store isn't worth the amount of time it takes to get it.

i loved the book i have trouble putting it down and im happy with the product.
What i don't like is that i payed 6 bucks for shipping and the envelope it was in was completely sticky though the hole thing. Witch could have ruined my book thankfully it didn't. So if you wish not risk it ruining yours maybe look else where for it."^5^October 19, 2015
Coco, ^45448058^6^0^"I loved the idea of reading the story from Christian's point of view! Obviously, it is the same story told by another character; therefore, it is repetitive. I enjoyed every word of it, though. I can hardly wait for the second part!"^5^December 12, 2015
H4ppyPar3nt, ^45448058^6^1^"Grey is Fifty Shades from Christian's point of view. In my opinion, it is better than the original book. It gives insight as to what he is thinking and feeling.

Fyxation, ^20664829^48^9^"You can't beat the price on this package. If you've been thinking about it, now's the time to buy. This series appeals to more than just fantasy lovers. It lures you in with humanity, political intrigue, massive piles of character development, heartbreak, triumphs, and dragons.

I'd been urged to read the books because I'd 'Like them if I tried them.' After the first episode of the show aired, I borrowed them immediately and plowed through every book that was available. Now that Dance with Dragons is in paperback, I decided to buy this pack to hold me over until the next book.

If you consider yourself a casual reader, don't be daunted by these thousand-page monsters. You'll eat them up and be hungry for more before you know it. And since they're in paperback, you can tote them around with you and plunge your nose into them whenever you get the chance. Difficult to do that with the massive hardback editions.

Again, I can't stress how great this price is. The individual MSRP for these is $9.99 each.

If you have any interest in the TV show or are just looking for something new to read, this is definitely something you want to add to your cart."^5^March 21, 2014

Daniel95, ^20664829^11^3^"This book is great in everway it has a compelling story that makes you not want to put the book down.The chapters are not so long but they are not to short they range from 10 pages to 22 pages a chapter.All the characters are great they are not flat meaning they have alot more to them as you read and they all have something that makes each character unique.The only problem I have with the way it is written is that there is no index meaning there is no chapter list and the chapters are named by the characters names instead of the traditional chapter 1 or chapter 2.The biggest problem is that some letters will be missing but it is usually the last letter of the word and there are tiny ink blotches on alot of pages, on words and on the sides of the pages.But for 26 dollars online that is still a great price and the quality of it is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.If you decide to buy it in the store it cost me 36 dollars which is a little more than if you buy it online,hope this helps.This book is phenomenal and is my favorite book."^4^March 13, 2014
lapis2014, ^20664829^6^1^"I started watching the series on HBO this year.....watched the first 3 seasons on demand just prior to the 4th season start. I was so dissappointed when the 4th season was finished because I would have to wait until next season to find out what happens. I did some online checking and found out the story is based on a series of books, so I bought the books...now I don't have to wait to find out what happens....I'll know what to expect when season 5 starts.

However, with that in mind I did not realize how little the books would be. Which leads to the writing in the book being very tiny and an eye strain.

Sarah1766, ^38412112^6^1^"I love these books. Having them in smaller, more portable versions is nice, but they almost seem too small at times. I like that they are leather bound though. They smell wonderful! :P These are much better than paperback copies that I've seen."^5^December 31, 2014
Booklover01, ^38412112^2^0^"The books alone are very nice. Though the leather is not real, it's very soft to the touch. However, these books very bendable  and  are rather small. They're not quite pocket sized, but no where near the length of a regular sized hardcover.  You could fit one in a small handbag easily. The text is also quite small, so if you have trouble reading small writing I wouldn't recommend this for you. All that said this is a great set for the price, as I know most other versions can be pricey.  If you're looking for something bigger and more durable, but not to pricey, I'd get the regular paper back versions with the movie adaptation on the covers.  (prices vary depending on website).  But in my opinin it's well worth the money to get a better copy, especially if you or the person your shopping for is a big J.R.R. Tolkien fan."^4^November 30, 2016

I just bought the paperback for my 15 year old granddaughter, hoping she will love it just as much. In my opinion, SK never again wrote anything as perfect.

Hyacinth, ^4431164^1^8^"I have no clue the reason Walmart will sell this type of product to the public in the name of new book.

The edges are so ragged like what a kid will do when cutting sheets of paper to put together a journal. There is no smoothness to the edges. No more than ten pages have edges that are same length and smoothness. What a mess!!

This edition also includes a short biographical sketch of the Grimm brothers and the times in which they lived. For some readers this extra information can increase the readers' understanding of the nature of these tales.

The book itself is hard bound with gold edged pages (which by the way protects the page edges and facilitates dusting). An exquisite appearance for any book collection."^5^June 29, 2013

CalicoBrindle, ^20610972^3^1^"The story as a whole is alright but as you go through the rest of the book (and into the second one) it's a 3 page sexual experience every 3 pages. Ana is rediculously naive and her 'beginning' into BDSM is very far fetched. I love erotica and this one has decent erotica and an 'ok' story but I think the writter hinged the whole book too hard on doing every single sexual act between Christian and Ana (like she used it to fill the book because she couldn't or didn't want to add other events/story to it). I've read erotica that can do both and I guess I'm holding this author to too high of a bar. I'm at the end of the 2nd and had bought the 3rd at the same time as the 2nd but will most likely return it as the 2nd hasn't been as good as I thought it would be and don't see the 3rd being worth the read. If you are looking for pure sexual interaction between two main characters this is for you. If you want erotica and story I'd suggest The Black Dagger Brotherhood etc."^3^March 17, 2013

plenilune, ^4123631^1^0^"It took me a little while to get going, but I ended up devouring this book. I particularly enjoyed the chapters with Nakata, and then Hoshino, due largely to particularly enjoying those characters: endearing, open to possibility and aware of their limitations. I developed genuine interest in them, what happened to them, and more than once found myself on the edge of my seat while reading their chapters. I was not so enamored of Kafka, ostensibly the protagonist, but more acted upon than acting (aside from when he initially runs away). I had to keep reminding myself he was only fifteen and thus as a reader I needed to be patient with his development. I didn't get the character Crow at all. I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be an aspect of Kafka, an imaginary friend, a living spirit, etc., and expected part of Kafka's development to be outgrowing Crow. I found myself looking at the world a little differently while reading this book, or perhaps not looking at it differently but feeling it differently. Murakami's writing belies profound intelligence and an ability to create a whole experience for the reader, something lacking in most fiction, even in much good writing. This was my first by him, but will not be my last."^4^August 9, 2009
TerrapinJetta, ^4123631^1^0^"Average at best. Starts off very strongly though, but I was disappointed by the ending. I love the idea of being able to talk to cats, and I feel it moulds reality with fantasy very well."^3^October 19, 2006
poplin, ^4123631^1^0^"Kafka on the Shore follows the stories of Kafka Tamura, a 15-year-old runaway with the specter of Greek tragedy hanging over his head, and Nakata, a senior citizen who was rendered mentally slow by a bizarre childhood incident (but left with the ability to communicate with cats). Their narratives are presented in parallel, and as the novel progresses, the fate of each becomes intertwined with that of the other-as much on a spiritual plane as on a physical one. Surrounding them is a world in a constant state of dream. Murakami is often characterized as a magical realist, and although I can see why, I believe this is something of a misclassification. I once read an article that posited that the feature that distinguishes magical realism from pure fantasy is the way cause and effect is treated. In fantasy, magical events occur without reason or explanation, whereas in magical realism, seemingly magical acts are given a cause-even if the link that binds together cause and effect seems implausible or even absurd. For example, in Midnight's Children, the main character's telepathic abilities are awakened when he inhales a pajama cord too deeply. Here, however, the connection between cause and effect is buried deeply, and is often nowhere to be found. My mind desperately sought to find a connection between Johnnie Walker and Colonel Sanders, knowing the repetitious use of brand names must mean something, and yet I came up empty-handed. I believe that Murakami's intent was to create not a world where magic and reality coexist but rather one in which the line between waking and dream is razor thin and easily breached. As in dreams, there is a sense of connection between people and explanations underlying events that can almost be seen, almost be grasped, yet remains elusively just out of focus. How is the reader supposed to understand a dream not of his own imagination? Hoshino, the truck driver who befriends Nakata and helps him complete his mission, seems to take the proper position: with some difficulty, he stops questioning the meaning of improbable events and unlikely characters, and accepts the dream as his own. Even the unsatisfying conclusion that offers little explanation and feels at first to be rushed and anticlimactic ultimately plays into Murakami's vision of a shared dream. Dreams invariably end with looses threads, and this one is no exception. Kafka on the Shore is unsettling and enchanting, and has the mark of a book that will only continue to bloom upon another read."^5^May 5, 2008

TerriB, ^4123631^1^0^"Everything is metaphor. Nothing is metaphor. Metaphor is reality. Murakami takes the reader on a surreal trip that will leave you breathless while also leaving you to wonder what you missed. Kafka on the Shore is, in part, a quest. Fifteen year old Kafka Tamura runs from home in order to pursue his past, to find his mother and sister who haven't been seen since he was a little boy, and to find out who he is apart from his father. His quest begins as he seeks for answers to his past, but at some point in the journey he realizes the futility of this and turns to pursue his future instead. The story alternates between Kafka and an elderly gentleman by the name of Mr. Nakata. Nakata wants to find the half of himself that was lost when he was a young boy during World War II. A mysterious event left Nakata unable to read, and in his own words, 'not very bright.' As he journeys, Nakata is not sure where he is going or what he is looking for, but intuits that he will know it when he sees it. The mysterious event of World War II, which took a part of Mr. Nakata, remains a blurry element of the novel. It is never looked at directly, but is something that is seen in the 'peripheral vision' and is similar to those things that, in the darkness, are better seen when looked at indirectly. Mr. Nakata can not remember what happened and suffers an amnesia that might be metaphor for a national amnesia surrounding the events of World War II. I am aware of the concept of national amnesia, but am hardly an expert in this area and so will leave this thought to be pursued by those better qualified. Murakami is known for his use of magical realism, and Kafka on the Shore has plenty of opportunity for the reader to suspend his or her disbelief. Talking cats, fish raining from the sky, and appearances by Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders should not surprise Murakami's readers. If this isn't enough to confuse many of us, Murakami also takes occasional jaunts into the metaphysical realm. The novel is often confusing and requires the reader to simply follow where Murakami leads. The ending is ambiguous, but somehow the book makes sense without a coherent resolution. Murakami has written a novel that is hopeful and speaks of the human capacity to go forward and reach for that 'brand-new world' that is constantly before us."^5^January 25, 2009
saskiaberanek, ^4123631^1^0^"mind numbingly pretentious, self absorbed prose. An author who spends many, many pages saying absolutely nothing."^2^January 17, 2011
GingerbreadMan, ^4123631^1^0^"This is going to be one of those LT reviews starting with the words 'I really wanted to like this book', I'm afraid. I've very much enjoyed the two Murakami books I've read before. And Kafka on the Shore basically has all the same qualities. A sense of normality tilting, a lot of things possible to read both metaphorically and concretely, and a surrealism told in a very clear prose. But something in the story of fifteen year old Kafka Tamura, on the run from his father and an Oedipal prophecy, and the old Nakata, slow-witted since a strange accident in his childhood but with the ability to talk to cats, doesn't quite catch me. It just doesn't feel as well composed to me, but instead constructed. It's like there are too few pieces in this mosaic to be mosaic, and the imagery is flatter than in the other two books I've read. And much too much of this book seems to rely on suddenly getting new information verbally. Also, since we never really learn anything about Kafka's father, the whole situation of being alone and on the run is abstract and somewhat un-engaging. There are lots of memorable situations here, and Murakami's quietly drastic way of moving things in new directions without really pushing it is often as good as ever. But closing the book, I'm not moved like I was by Sputnik Sweetheart, nor filled with gentle puzzlement like I was after The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. Maybe it's just me."^3^November 4, 2010
kattepusen, ^4123631^1^0^"This is my first time reading Japanese author Haruki Murakami - and it will definitely not be my last. Kafka on the Shore is quite enigmatic, and the story is such an origial tale with enormous seductive powers. The novel consists of two intertwining stories featuring 15-year old run-away student Kafka Tamura and retired feline-loving simpleton Nakata. They are both on a journey, but for different reasons. The coming-of-age story of Kafka is the perfect compliment to Nakata's 'exit-of age'. Don't worry about me giving away the ending - mostly because the author himself dosn't seem to be giving it away. Suffice it to say it is a modern Oedipus tale sauteed with plenty of surreal twists served over a steeming order of nail-biting suspense. I have recently read too many novels where there are lots of 'mysteries' and overly constructed surprises only to have a conclusion where it is all nicely tied up and neatly explained - and you are supposed to be surprised as to how it all was really connected. It is becoming such a tired and quite predictable formula. This story, however, will not give you the answers like tomorrow's newspaper will give you the solved sudoku puzzle. In a certain way, Murakami reminds me a bit of Kundera (my all-time favorite author). The characters are compelling, the descriptions acute, yet elusive, the emotions raw and brutally honest, and the sense of mystery unapologetically lingers long after the story ends. As far as the translation is concerned, it did seem a bit 'over-translated' at times. It seemed artifial to read about dollars instead of yen, and the colloquial expressions often seemed too American...However, I don't speak any Japanese, so I cannot be too critical - I can just offer my sense of the translated text. I cannot wait to read more from this Japanese Kundera..."^4^July 15, 2006
DanielZKlein, ^4123631^1^0^"Murakami builds a beautiful tale and hints at all sorts of wonderful things that he is going to do with it, and then he allows it to fall apart. There are books with frustrating endings, like _City of Glass_, where you cannot help but think of the way in which the ending refused to do anything you wanted it to, but where you feel that this was quite intentional and that the whole book had been headed for this end. Not so here: it seems that Murakami constructed a great tale up to the 3/4 point, then didn't know what to do with it, added some vague and inconsequential scenes that in no way had any relevance to the rest of the book, and then stopped writing. The only other book I remember which stopped rather than ended in this way was John Grisham's _The Brethren_, and that comparison says a lot of bad things about Murakami."^3^December 26, 2008
acaptaind, ^11052066^5^0^"Let me start by saying that I was never into reading books. After that said, I can now say I am do to Lee Child's. Now to the book, I started donating and I was so bored just sitting there. I decided that I will get a book and ended up picking this one. With in the first chapter I was already hooked. This book, along with the whole Reacher Novels by Lee Child, has mystery, suspence, romance, comedy, thrills and anything else you can think of. Even the ending of this book was just wonderful. I can only say that if you are looking for a great book or want to get into reading, this is really a great book."^5^August 22, 2010

When I first started reading it, it made me want to stay in bed all day just to read it. I love this book. Soon after I realize that the little girl may never talk, I began to wonder if this book was actually good for anything besides heartbreak. And then I realized, that they wouldn't make a book if the characters didn't talk. And I got all the way through the book, and it was ah-mazing!

AlwaysShopping10, ^518704^7^4^"Another classic written by John Steinbeck is Of Mice and Men, it's one of those of books that you can't put down once you begin to read it. This tale of two laborers: Lennie, a man large in physical stature with a child like mind and George, who's quick and small and the 'brains of the duo', the men work in vegetable fields to support themselves with the goal being that they can earn enough to allow them to live 'off the fat of the land'. George more or less plays protector to Lennie to ensure that they both stay out of trouble and that they do not ruin their chances of getting some land of their own.

PrincessLadyLala, ^23961551^1^1^"This story was so beautiful and captured my heart!

Iola's story was amazing! Like Tandi, I felt as if Iola is a long lost friend that is so beautiful inside and out! I felt like I was sneaking off to come read more of her story like Tandi when she was sneaking away to come read more letters out of the prayer box in the blue room (when we both should be cleaning)! The heart that Iola had for the families of the Outer Banks was so mind changing for me because in so many little (and big) ways she helped her community without being known. She didn't brag or boast about it, but humbly worked for her Father with joy. Not only that, she prayed over these families and her community with a deep love that comes from the Father. She was so inspiring to me with her words of wisdom that God gave her as well as through the conservations she had with her sister-friend!

Tandi's story was so heart-wrenching in many places! It was hard to see her want to stop old habits and make a new lifestyle for herself as well as her family, but having the pain and anger from the past keep haunting her. At first I didn't really like Tandi, but as I learned her story along side Iola's I started to soften towards her and ached for the way she viewed herself. Always thinking she wasn't good enough and believing whatever trash talk people told her, especially Gina (I was so glad she stood up to her near the end). I felt that as Tandi learned from Iola that I was too. I was on the same journey with her of believing the words God tells us, rather then the negative words people tell us. Also seeing the river of grace that is constantly flowing around us.

Beside learning so much from these two stories, I learned so much about what prayer boxes can do in one's life. I have a prayer journal, but learning about where and how prayer boxes originated from the in 'Note From the Author' makes me want to start a new tradition in my family! This story definitely inspired me in more ways than one!

My rating: 5 out of 5 stars (on a side note, the ending was perfect)!

Darcy has worked in her families Irish pub all her life, but dreams of leaving her little town to live a more affluent lifestyle. She just never considered her voice might be the key to fulfilling her dream until Trevor Magee comes to her town of Ardmore to build a new theater onto Gallagher's pub. Surprise Darcy! Trevor's family owns a record company and once hearing beautiful Darcy's voice wants to sign her. All through out the story their attraction and love for each other complicate this duo's goals. Their relationship is further complicated by the fact that Carrick, Prince of Fairies, and the love of his life, ghost Lady Gwen need them to fall in love in order to free Gwen from a curse, so that they can finally be together, but Darcy and Trevor won't be forced into a relationship just to free them. The cherry on top is the fact that Nora Roberts authored this book and any story by her is an enjoyable adventure."^5^February 10, 2013

It takes a real good story to get me interested and lets just say that doesn't happen too often. I have probably read maybe almost 1 book within 5+ years so as you can see this book is highly entertain-able and enjoyable. I love all the characters and their individual quirks and personalities. I love the dialog between one another -- especially Jamie and Claire. A very lovely book that I look forward to finishing -- although there is a part of me not wanting the first novel to end. The design of the book is really excellent. I was expecting it to have a cover sleeve as most hardbacks do but this one does not. It is entirely hardback with extra special tidbits thrown in the end about Diana Gabaldon, her inspiration, a bit of history and to my surprise, a cd from 'Outlander the musical'.

Moonpie72, ^55344290^4^0^"From the first time I read a book by Ms. Wingate, she captivated me with her stories and writing.  I was very excited to read this book and it far surpassed my expectations.
I am intrigued my fictional novels that are based on true stories. The facts are true but how they are made play out in the characters’ stories lies in the hands of the author.  Through Lisa Wingate’s talent and writing skill, these individuals were literally brought to life, so much so I had to keep reminding myself they were fictional!
Until this novel I had never heard of the Tennessee Children’s Home Society spearheaded by Georgia Tann. From the 1920’s through 1950’s, hundreds of children were kidnapped by abduction or trickery from loving and caring parents. Until they were adopted by wealthy or famous people, for a hefty fee, they suffered unimaginable physical abuse, sexual assault, neglect, and with some even death. 
In 1939 a young girl, Rill, and her siblings lived happily in poverty on a house boat with their parents.   While her father and mother were at the hospital welcoming another child they were snatched away and taken to one of Ms. Tann’s “homes”.  That was when the nightmare began.  As if the heartbreak of being separated from their parents was not enough, Rill also felt the pain of trying to protect her younger siblings and keep them together in an environment of cruelty and violence. 
My heart broke at the horrors these children encountered.  I never imagined! 
The chapters alternate from Rill’s narrative to Avery Stafford in the present day.  Avery is 30, wealthy, privileged and the member of a prestigious political family, totally opposite to Rill’s experience.  When Avery attends a nursing home tour a resident appears to recognize her. She returns to visit her. In a sepia photo in May Crandall’s room she sees a family.  One of the children strongly resembles her grandmother.  She cannot get it out of her mind and begins to relentlessly seek out answers about her Grandma Judy’s past.  Could May be a part of that past?  Due to dementia claiming her grandmother’s once sharp mind she cannot ask her questions.  It’s all up to Avery.  What secrets will she unearth?  How will they change her and her family’s lives?  I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough!  An incredible book with an amazing story!

Thor, ^15441704^1^1^"John Grisham has turned away from his talent and turned into a political hack. 'The Confession' reeks with liberal slant and innuendos. He makes it clear he hates conservatives, the death penalty, and any form of Christianity that has any semblance of accountability. Conservatives are made to look like hate mongering, racist, ignoramuses. I used to love John Grisham books and have read most of his novels. However, I will not be purchasing any more of his books. His attacks on conservatives, and especially conservative Christians, are of the classical, stereotypical nature from the less informed."^1^May 13, 2012

I wanted to know what happened next. Would their quest to stop the execution of an innocent man be successful? What would happen next? It was a definite thrill ride of a read and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I would recommend 'The Confession' to anyone."^4^September 2, 2011
michelle31071, ^15441704^1^0^"The Confession: By John Grisham (Received from BzzAgent for Review)

In 1998 Travis Boyette abducts, abuses and murders a high school cheerleader then buries the body so it will never be found. Donte Drumm a local football star is convicted and sentenced to Death Row for the crime while Travis moves on to committ other crimes. Nine years after the murder Travis is released from prison for a different crime and visits a church with Reverend Schroeder preaching. After listening to a sermon given by Reverend Schroeder Travis pays a visit to the Reverend telling the Reverend he has an inoperable brain tumor that is terminal and then tells the Reverend about Donte who is on Death Row for a crime he didn't committ. But Travis leaves from the first visit without actually confessing. The rest of the story tells how the Reverend Schroeder works to get Travis to confess to try to save Donte and the trials of getting a legal system that has already convicted someone of a crime to listen in time to try to save Donte.

REVIEW: As with all John Grisham books that I have read this one is extremely well written and holds a readers attention from page one and is still offering surprises on the last page. Grisham like many good writers uses his writting to give voice to his personal view points on the death penalty and what he sees as flaws in our legal system, causing a reader to think and question the status quo. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dramatic legal suspense stories."^5^September 27, 2011

bill_reyn, ^52705832^4^0^"This book offers a very readable, entertaining version of the Arthurian legend. It is not a book for purists--C. S. Lewis thought the book was an abomination, especially in its treatment of Palomides. But for the uninitiated or those who choose not to plow through the Mort D'Arthur, this is a very happy alternative. White captures both the humor and the pathos of the legend. There were places in the first section, The Sword In The Stone, where I actually laughed out loud. Later in the book, I felt the ache at the inevitability of the downfall of Camelot. I keep reading the book over, hoping that the ending will change--but it never does. The one real drawback--although an entertaining one--is the caricature of Merlin. He appears to be a lovable hayseed with a bad memory who happens to be able to turn the Wart (Arthur) into different kinds of animals during his education. We experience none of the wizard's real power of presence. I've read the book four times and still find it entertaining."^4^September 5, 2015
Awesomeness1, ^52705832^4^0^"I finally finished this book. It was assigned school reading, that had to be done after winter break. So guess what I spent my winter break doing! At first, I hated it. It was boring and I couldn't even stop reading it for threat that my English teachers head would explode. I was forced to persevere, and I'm glad I did. Once I got used to the sporadic pacing and style, I quite enjoyed it. Especially, the last book. The tone of the novel changed with the story line, as things became more and more tragic. The pacing was weird though, and there were intentional anachronisms which just added to the oddness. There would parts that were dreadfully boring to read then it would get all actiony, then White would go on a rant. It would also be very frank in some places, then overly detailed in others. I don't know. It was an experience, and I'm glad I (was forced to) read it."^4^January 3, 2010
melydia, ^52705832^2^0^"I thought I'd read this for a class in high school, but I know now that I did not. This lengthy tome is actually four books in one. 'The Sword in the Stone,' which inspired the Disney film of the same name, is the charming story of Arthur's childhood with Sir Ector, Kay, Merlyn, and the rest. Easily my favorite of the four. Next is 'The Queen of Air and Darkness,' which introduces the Gaelic Orkney clan, headed by Morgause. It's probably the funniest book, between the silliness of King Pellinore's lovesickness and the darker humor of the Orkney sons' desperate attempts to get their mother's attention. 'The Ill-Made Knight' was my least favorite. It's all about Lancelot and his unending angst. 'The Candle in the Wind' more or less wraps up the Lancelot story, with a sometimes irritating amount of commentary on how much better everything and everyone was back in those days. I wish the story could have gone all the way through Arthur's death and successor, but by and large I could see why this is considered one of the quintessential books on Arthurian Legend. I could spot the inspiration for many other works, from Excalibur to Monty Python's Holy Grail. If you're a fan of Arthur, I would definitely recommend reading. If you only have a passing interest, just read 'The Sword in the Stone.' It's delightful."^4^October 28, 2009
mattries37315, ^52705832^2^0^"There have been many accounts of the Arthurian saga over the 1500 years, the best thought of the past century has been T.H. White's 'The Once and Future King'. Though White's prose is good and engaging, the narrative arc through is tetralogy-in-one edition is problematic enough that it sometimes overshadows the wonderful characters he has developed. The first of the four individual works, 'The Sword in the Stone', is the best of all four. White's writes wonderful characters, especially young Arthur (aka Wart), in well-rounded depth. The narrative flow of this work is the best of any of them and sets up the reign of Arthur that makes the reader look forward to seeing what happens next. Unfortunately in 'The Queen of Air and Darkness' the characters are not well rounded and the narrative aimlessly wanders between England and the Orkneys without connecting the two until the last chapter when an evil scheme comes to fruition that the reader did not know what actually happening. The third and longest of the individual works, 'The Ill-Made Knight' focuses on an ugly Lancelot, his love affair with Guinevere, and the knightly exploits of the Round Table. While this individual work is somewhat engaging, White emasculates Arthur both physically and mentally that continues into final individual work, 'The Candle in the Wind', while other characters aren't even given much depth or story arc. Throughout the entire writing, White injects himself and modern day elements throughout the entire book making it hard for the reader to keep to the narrative flow and maintain a 'suspension of disbelief'. Another unfortunate decision by White was to insist his story was real history of a part of the medieval era then mention 'the supposed Henry III' or 'the supposed Richard the Lionhearted' throughout. Also White assumed that his readers were versed in Thomas Malory's 'The Death of Arthur', which I must admit a half century ago might have been the case, nowadays readers ironically look to 'The Once and Future King.' And there were White's tangents, whether it was philosophy or history, that were beautifully written but had no bearing whatsoever on the plot or characters or anything else he had just written about before he went down those literary side roads. Upon completing 'The Once and Future King', I can see why many people enjoyed it and rated it highly. However, I personally can't ignore narrative stumbles or downright tangents that made three-quarters of the book harder to read than the section covering 'The Sword in the Stone'. My advice before reading T.H. White is to read Malory's book first and be prepared for references from the 1930s to the late 50s, or you'll be taken aback."^4^April 15, 2015
debnance, ^52705832^2^0^"This is the definitive book about King Arthur, first published in 1939. All the characters in this book are seen with soft eyes, the eyes of a forgiving man, who finds ways to explain even the most cruel of actions. A few depictions seemed surprising; Lancelot, for example, is portrayed as an ugly man. It is the big view of the author that I found most compelling. The author looked at Arthur's reign as a major change in the way humanity lived, not living to take revenge on its enemies, but attempting to settle squabbles with diplomacy."^5^January 29, 2010
wirkman, ^52705832^1^0^"Four books under one cover, with the original fifth ('The Book of Merlyn') only printed in the '70s, this work nevertheless became a classic way back when, long before I was born. It is a deserved classic. First, there is 'The Sword in the Stone,' a marvelous boys' book, a tale of growing up, a novel of education. Made into a bad Disney film, it should not be dismissed because of this. It is a great tale, funny, enlightening, clever, exciting, mysterious and in the end quite heart-rending. Then there is 'The Queen of Air and Darkness,' a rewrite, or condensation of the first sequel, 'The Witch in the Wood,' which I've never read. This book contrasts darkness and light chapter by chapter, with hilarious buffoonery from King Pellinore, and sad, sorrowful tales of the children of Morgause . . . who in the end ensorcles the young King Arthur (yes, these are Arthurian tales; didn't I mention that?). Next is the tale of courtly love . . . that is, adultery, the grandest tragic adultery of all, that of Gwynevere and Lancelot. A sad tale, very well done. And then it all raps up, perhaps a little too hastily, in 'The Candle in the Wind.' Arthur, dying, finally understands the lessons Merlyn had been trying to tell. Rarely has a book's explicit lesson been worth a wade through fiction. In this book, it is. White has a message, and it increases, rather than detracts, from the tragedy of his book. Indeed, the tragedy really is that Arthur learns too late. And thus, this fantasy proves as realistic as any other, more realistic than most, for the tragedy is the tragedy of most in life. Too many of us learn too late. The greatest lessons are hard. And they rub against the grain of our natures. You will weep for Arthur. More than once, in this once and future book, but, in a sense, the tears may also be for yourself, and all humanity. Just possibly."^5^February 28, 2007
overthemoon, ^52705832^1^0^"A book - no, four books - to revel in the language and the wit, relating the story of Arthur from his childhood as the Wart, living with Sir Ector, through his reign, the idealistic creation of the Round Table, the affair between Lancelot and Guinever, his old age and decline. The end, where Arthur, before going into final battle, reflects on his childhood and all he learnt with Merlin and observation of the animals, is incredibly profound and moving, in particular his thoughts about war: 'He remembered Lyo-lyok and the island which they had seen on their migration, where all those puffins, razorbills, guillemots and kittiwakes had lived together peacefully, preserving their own kinds of civilisation without war - because they claimed no boundaries. He saw the problem before him as plain as a map. The fantastic thing about war was that it was fought about nothing - literally nothing. Frontiers were imaginary lines. ... It was geography which was the cause - political geography. It was nothing else. Nations did not need to have the same kind of civilisation, nor the same kind of leader, any more than the puffins and the guillemots did. They could keep their own cilivisations, like Esquimaux and Hottentots, if they would give each other freedom of trade and free passage and access to the world. Countries would have to become counties - but counties which could keep their own culture and local laws. The imaginary lines on the earth's surface only needed to be unimagined. The airborne birds skipped them by nature. How mad the frontiers had seemed to Lyo-lyok, and would to Man if he could learn to fly.'"^5^July 19, 2015

ScoLgo, ^52705832^1^0^"Epic, brutal and funny. Brutally funny, really. Now I see where the Monty Python guys got their inspiration for their Holy Grail movie. The humour is similar in many ways. Python approached it with more silliness but the influence is undeniable. Of the four books, I enjoyed the first two the most. Book 1: The Sword in the Stone; tells the story of Arthur's childhood and education by Merlyn, the absent-minded magician who is living his life backward in time. It culminates, rather hastily, with Arthur repeatedly pulling the sword out of the anvil to show that he is the new king. Book 2: The Queen of Air and Darkness, (a.k.a. The Witch of the Wood); tells of Arthur's young adulthood where he conceives the Round Table, defeats King Lot to secure the kingdom, and is seduced by Morgause - thereby sowing the seeds of future ruin. Book 3: The Ill-Made Knight; the longest book in the volume focuses more on the adventures of Lancelot and his illicit affair with Guenever. In this book, we begin to see less humour as the tone becomes more serious and the narrative veers toward the philosohical and tragic. Book 4: The Candle in the Wind; sees Arthur in his dotage. Trapped by the ethics of his own Round Table creation, he struggles to hold his kingdom together in the face of treachery, betrayal, and deceit."^4^December 16, 2014

kthclark, ^52705832^1^0^"King Arthur and his Round Table never struck much interest in me but when you add wizardry and war, it really caught my interest. We all can get caught up in the swords stuck in stones, being turned into birds or fish, or dashing knights saving damsels in distress, but 'The Once and Future King' is about how we act as humans - wrong or right, good or bad - and the repercussions of the decisions made, not only by our elected or appointed officials, but by us as individuals. Merlin sparked the interest of many young boys back then, just as Harry Potter does today. This is a very long novel but the vocabulary level is approximately at an 8th grade level. I'm sure many high school students would shy away from this book based solely on its length but those who choose to read it, will be very pleased."^3^July 9, 2009
beckykolacki, ^52705832^1^0^"When I read The Once and Future King, by T.H. White, I was looking for a good novel that detailed the life of King Arthur. Since there is no definitive work, and I wanted something a little easier than Malory, this one was recommended. I have to say that I didn't really enjoy it until after the first section. The book is broken up into four parts, and the first part is about Arthur as a boy, and how Merlin turns him into various animals for his 'education.' This is all fun and well, but it's not all that interesting. And quite frankly, it's the type of thing where you can read one chapter and then feel no desire to pick the book up again for weeks because you're not waiting to find out what's going to happen. However, once Arthur (finally!) becomes King, it got a lot better. It then chronicles his life with Guinevere, his friendship with Lancelot (there's a whole section devoted to him), his relationship with Gawaine's family, and his relationship with his son, Mordred. Overall it's written well and the pace is pretty good. Occasionally it drifts off into some boring tangent about the history of England or something, but when it's on track it's great. Of course, that sort of writing was more common and appreciated when this book was written, but it's a challenge for today's readers. It was also a bit more humorous than I expected. T.H. White can be somewhat sarcastic with what he writes, and it occasionally overlaps into satire of other things written about Arthur and Camelot. Some of the characters are more caricatures than I expected. The only thing after the first part that I was disappointed with was the ending. If you know the story of King Arthur you know his fate, but it would still be nice to see how this book deals with it and to see it play out. Instead you get one paragraph about what happened: telling rather than showing. I don't really understand why he would skimp on the ending when he had no problem describing everything else in so much detail. I would also add that I don't think this is at all a children's book, though I've seen it classified that way. Not necessarily because of subject matter, but just because of reading level and difficulty."^4^October 2, 2010

CalicoBrindle, ^20610972^3^1^"The story as a whole is alright but as you go through the rest of the book (and into the second one) it's a 3 page sexual experience every 3 pages. Ana is rediculously naive and her 'beginning' into BDSM is very far fetched. I love erotica and this one has decent erotica and an 'ok' story but I think the writter hinged the whole book too hard on doing every single sexual act between Christian and Ana (like she used it to fill the book because she couldn't or didn't want to add other events/story to it). I've read erotica that can do both and I guess I'm holding this author to too high of a bar. I'm at the end of the 2nd and had bought the 3rd at the same time as the 2nd but will most likely return it as the 2nd hasn't been as good as I thought it would be and don't see the 3rd being worth the read. If you are looking for pure sexual interaction between two main characters this is for you. If you want erotica and story I'd suggest The Black Dagger Brotherhood etc."^3^March 17, 2013

Also, for those who may have found this story confusing in the beginning, note that this book 'Cry Wolf' IS the first in the series of Alpha & Omega... however, Patricia Briggs wrote a short story titled 'Alpha & Omega' which takes place before this book.

ReadersEntertainment, ^10180412^2^0^"It was a game, with game pieces and cards. Each game piece represented the player and each card told them who and how to kill.
Tansy was the only hope for the Ghostwalker team. She has a special ability to touch things and see its history, its terrifying history.
But her visions come at a price. She experiences those final moments.
This is one Feehan's greatest books. It has a great deal of thriller/suspense but still the action/adventure of the military paranormal team, the Ghostwalkers.
The romance is not sweet and innocent, but it is believable. And you feel for both the hero and the heroine as they struggle to choose between what they need and what is right.
Even if you don't usually read Feehan, if you like a good thriller, I highly recommend this book!"^5^December 31, 2008

ElGordo, ^301466^7^0^"This book is great. It's fairly short so it's a quick read, but it'll stay with you. It was originally written as a short story and broadened into novel length, so it keeps that brevity.

It delivers a story of the not too distant future where mankind has come up against a bug-like alien race twice, and barely survived both times. This time around the world governments have been testing their children for the best and brightest and sending them into a special military school in orbit around Earth. Here they train them from a tender age to be soldiers and commanders for the next war. Where barely surviving is no longer an option

I read and re-read this book to death in my tweens and early teens. Enough so that it had to be kept in a plastic bag to keep all the pages together after the binding disintigrated.

Another reviewer noted there is a bit of moderate swearing and the like. But honestly, that's what you get when you get a bunch of boys together. Actually, there is less vulgarity than when I was in grade school as a budding swearing enthusiast.

The sequels are really preachy (which gets pretty annoying), especially the parallel series about Bean, but don't let that stop you! You need to own this book. It deserves to be purchased in hard cover and kept for posterity."^5^December 6, 2007
